+1	our teething baby absolutely loved loved product would seek sooth sore gums its lasted year issue wear tear 
+1	a favorite house ! 
-1	i teether twin boys 8 years ago absolutely loved so , new baby started teething , i sought teether i surprised arrived packaging stated product , `` safety tested '' bpa , lead , phthalates it not state anywhere package bpa free as former regulator ( medical devices ) i sensitive company labeling statements perhaps much but , i would rather err side caution child concerned , lack clear `` bpa free '' labeling product gives pause specifically , test bpa , lead , phthalates , acceptable amount allowed ? ! if not , would n't company simply label product bpa , lead , phthalate free ? eight years ago , i gave toy sons , one ever heard bpa my boys put manner plastic toys mouths , i 'm sure riddled bpa but , day age , bpa strongly suspected dangerous , i not good conscience allow new baby chew anything may contain and , though someone site indicated representative company told bpa free , i 'm still skeptical again , not label ? most companies proudly label products simple language not confused 
+1	my daughter 6 mo loves no funky smell , bpa free just dont kneel ! the star rounded edges so far good 
+1	my daughter loves keeps happy long time it also easy wash keep clean well 
-1	this would ok teething necklace n't star bead as another reviewer pointed , child chews pointy edge star painful i thrown necklace pull road last week child screamed suddenly back car crying hysterically

+1	my son loves he likes & quot ; kangaroo & quot ; position best he actually crying first time put way , stopped immediately definitely make sure one buy comes video , though at babies r us many plastic bags ( returns ? ) without book video they must the usual type carriers baby putting weight pelvic bone n't good developing bones slings keep baby natural positions 
+1	fitted co-sleeper sheet , exactly like one came original bed shrinking wash shipped fast colors 
+1	the color close match it good quality sheet i would recommend anyone purchased co-sleeper change sheet spit ups 
+1	's bright colorful , great babies starting reach things n't think worth $ 15 though 's not durable stroller toy 've seen , 's cute

+1	i hate diaper genie i excited try diaper champ i say i love i hear many people complaining smell i say 're nuts ! ( offense ) my son 5 1/2 months old nursing also eats solids including table foods restaurant his diapers definately changed odor i not noticed odor coming diaper champ usually change bag week , every garbage day dirty diapers sitting longer week i also fold diapers husband calls egg diaper helps control odor i not even noticed bad odor changing bag i would outside keep odor baby 's bedroom so many people noticing odor problem product beyond they 've got something wrong oh unit need cleaned get big blow diaper like babies known , get poop pail , need wiped a good wiping antibacterial wipe , every week two n't hurt either 
+1	it holds almost week 's worth diapers , n't need expensive refills - kitchen bags work at first i problem smell , i realized flip lid back always keep side facing - smell ! it also wipe clean get chute bit dirty i second need fold diaper ( wipes inside ) neatly , not big deal the latch n't terribly difficult , i would n't want easy since sits son 's room 
+1	i love this product ! my husband and i chose to use cloth diapers on our son and this works great for holding them until they get washed we never notice a smell coming from it we also love that it uses regular trash bags rather than needing special bags it has been a really great product for us and we highly recommend it to anyone who is cloth diapering their baby 
+1	this one i ever used , say i like it ! it easy use , put white trash bag dumped diaper shute it holds ton daipers , smell not bad i notice daughter 15 months poop stonger dont put , due smell but diapers pee not smell the bad thing need ensure dont get # 2 shute stick it really easy use , n't take lot space 
+1	the diaper champ came easy assemble- took 2 minutes put together ! the design simple , yet brilliant , odors sealed inside diaper champ bag needs changed our baby 's room never smells ! we n't even think buying diaper genie thought idea buying special bags odor discs ridiculous we normally use standard tall kitchen trash bags , 're reusing plastic shopping bags even use diaper champ ( although 'd need change bag everyday buy it ! 
+1	we started diaper genie new parents we hated thing ! the `` new '' design still needs lots improvement ! the bags never fit right never spun right and two months sat corner room never used as entered toddlerhood started bad diapers becasue cutting teeth diet changes we decided something started researching the diaper champ best found ! there specail bags deal buy ! we use cheap $ 1 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags grocery store use bag laying around there also trick no spinning anyhting ! just flip handle diaper gone ! now start smelling leave diapers extended period ! we empty every day never odors ! it far better trash diaper genie 's fairly inexpensive baby products go ! 
-1	ok , idea diaper champ awesome -- easy use -- 's i gave 1 star however thing really stinks ! ! someone gave neat diaper disposal system baby shower & i absolutely loved however , handle broke 2 weeks ago i thought '' maybe i could try diaper champ since i wo n't purchase liners '' well huge mistake ! ! i see thing got 4 stars -- parents young children ! ! my daughter 14 months old & older , i guess diapers come odor ! after literally diapers , entire room smelled poop ! i could n't stand ! in one week , i changed garbage bag least 4 times is really saving money ? ? i n't think ! plus room really smelled bad i 'm taking back & getting neat ! the diaper champ must great infants , may want consider something else older babies ! 
+1	i bought diaper pail son days old i absolutely love ! i used work daycare diaper genie it pain use we hated the diaper champ could n't easier use and biggest plus n't buy expensive refills it takes regular trash bags i generally put kitchen size bags , use size pinch and excellent job keeping odor contained , diaper genie never ! if looking user-friendly diaper pail actually keep odor contained , diaper champ one ! 
+1	this great pail except heavy lid be careful changing bag n't come hand the seal come , not affect odor this really keep smell in with twins , change bag every couple days i wish little bigger i recommend pail ! ! ! 
+1	we diaper champ diaper genie and definitely prefer champ ! not much cost effective ( use regular trash bags rather refills $ 5 pop ) , easier use clean , larger capacity only problem frustrating messy put last diaper realizing unit full the pluger gets stuck & manually extract mess 
+1	let say after nanny almost 10 years i tried this one really great i actually took friends word went champ registering i glad i i knew along products i would not use , undecided actual one i wanted well champ survived 's first year son great ! ! we bought another baby boy number two coming next month the thought not buy refills using regular bags awesome ! we buy smaller bags come like 250 roll sented like $ 6 00 work great we recently buy another roll bags so $ 6 00 year bags- ca n't beat ! ! we lysol champ every time change bag not problems would reccommend anyone everyone ! ! 
+1	i love diaper champ ! everyone i knew diaper genie buy expensive refills not like twisting involved after reading reviews diaper champ , i put baby registry i glad i it easy use , keeps odors contained , uses regular trash bags ( much cheaper diaper pail refills ) it little tricky open first times i n't sure latch worked also , sure tabs soiled diapers secured diaper get stuck cylinder way 
+1	the champ great n't waste anymore money buying expensive refills like diaper genie this one uses regular bags ( i use 32 gallon bags ) i problems odor , i think anything put poop let sit days odor 's inevitable ! here 's tricks champ:1 put arm & hammer baking soda box bottom pail help eliminate orders and obvious , change bag every couple days eliminate smell n't expect leave week smell like roses ! 2 the side straps diaper get caught shoot make sure roll diaper really tight use straps hold together , otherwise diaper shoot get clogged 3 if 're like , probably tons grocery bags laying around keep handy nursery use bag poopy diapers double bagging helps eliminate orders hope helps ! 
+1	this diaper pail wonderful investment while diaper pails require use thier bags pail uses bag including old shopping bags this save alot money when first time mom tight budget every little bit helps i highly recommend diaper champ 
+1	love , love , love ! i love use regular plastic bags n't need buy refills once great stink bit i used big bag lot diapers wipes nice clean antibacterial wipes my daughter starting potty training i 'm still using great buy ! 
+1	i thought idea keeping dirty diapers house gross , i decided make 20 trips day trash boy , i misguided thinking , diaper champ godsend ! you really not smell thing ! i heard diaper genie huge mess , i not even attempt buy get limit trips trash ! 
-1	after reading glowing reviews receiving positive one friend , decided replace broken diaper genie ( lid broke ) champ what disappointment ! here big two complaints:1 it 's unsanitary putting diapers messy wipes slot dumping bucket leaves slot germy mess having clean slot every time unrealistic much work ! and i fear toddler getting anywhere near thing germs 2 the smell it 's probably not bad infant , let tell , opening lid empty toddler diapers one frightening experience ! yikes , smell couple days we used odor prevention garbage bags , nothing prepared odor i opened lid since nothing seals individual diapers , 's sea messy diapers yuck on plus side , 's wonderful able use regular garbage bags , not expensive ones genie requires and 's certainly easy use but i 'm not sure product better using garbage lid when second child arrives next year , 'll going back diaper genie it 's not perfect , 's much cleaner 's less odor involved ( reason get one products first place ) and new version genie much easier operate earlier model , 'll cross fingers lid stays attached next time 
+1	i love product ! with enormous numbers diapers go newborn , great easy dispose dirty ones plus , fact used regular trash bags great no need pay special refills brands require ! 
+1	i thought getting diaper genie first research this best money ! not less expensive diaper pails , also works best the time smell escapes open take bag i really love n't buy bags , takes perfectly good trash bags that save bundle money alone ! it works really great us would n't use anything else i wish would hold diapers i really ca n't complain do n't buy anything else ! 
+1	this must have product new moms ! ! ! ! the one thing sets product apart diaper genie product use regular garbage bags any garbage bags fit the diaper genie needs 's refill bags order work 's money n't spend this easy work easy dispose dirty diapers fantastic ! 
+1	the diaper champ excellent i experienced issues odor , fact i keep baby 's closet no special bags needed savings ! just spray lysol bag changes everything smells rosy ! great value excellent product 
-1	when hand-me-down diaper genie broke , i bought diaper champ i figured i 'd save money not buy diaper genie refills while i happy able use regular trash bags , really impressed diaper champ the odor protection diaper champ really leaves something desired my son 's room smelled badly , even i changed pail every day changing diaper champ really n't pleasant experience not odor multiple nasty diapers spew forth ( nothing sealed ) open lid change trash bag , trash bag somewhat difficult position correctly well , i 'm back using diaper genie , son 's room smells fine save money buy something diaper champ first time around 
+1	unlike diaper genie , diaper champ used disposable cloth diapers we two since mostly use cloth , occasionally need use disposable it 's great , easy use , empty couple times week get little stink rotting diapers it 's easy use , 18 mo old daughter figured flip started fun she 's 2 5 still loves flip training pants pail 
+1	i chose register diaper champ convenience you use plain ole garbage bag instead purchasing something separate what busy mom time run get special bags ? in 5 months i 've one instance terrible smell really bad diaper - know : ) it 's easy clean easy use 
+1	i like diaper champ n't use specific bags i n't like easily gets backed though i frequently push center get rotate , much needs changed 
+1	i 've used genie past much prefer diaper champ i 'm practicality comes baby products diaper champ right line views very easy use , ( senior citizen parents figured lol ) , controls odor well uses regular trash bags woohoo ! who wants spend money time `` fancy '' trash bags buy diaper champ save money something fun baby 
+1	i love diaper champ i got shower gift hadent heard i started using i tell friends this definatly gift choice pregnant friends as reviews say smell isnt great gets full not bad ( i see hint bag full time change ) i also spray inside w/ febreeze lysol disinfectant change nips problem bud overall , its one things i cant live without didnt know i got 
+1	the best thing product n't purchase bags it certainly reduce odor bag still needs replaced regularly otherwise odor sneak 
+1	i love ! i hesitant buy since `` sheet '' expensive hardly `` sheet '' but i used , made changing crib middle night speedy , letting baby me get back sleep quicker first , soft lay , absorbant waterproof if baby 's diaper leaks gets sheet you take sheet easily removing snaps attached around crib slats we crib matress dressed additional regular crib sheet underneath cheap matress pad this allows us make thru night without make full crib linen change -- - least morning i certainly buy gift friends baby showers ! 
+1	it 's kind weird putting cover crib sheet ( never change crib sheet ) , lifesaver daughter started leaking poop like crazy overnight changing crib sheet daily not fun after i got , got bit easier it 's not super fast unsnap snap , better replacing crib sheet ( esp given i mobile gets way taking mattress ) i 3 i n't immediately wash dirty one only con material seems little rough not soft crib sheet fabric , unfortunately 
+1	i using sheets 6 months i two ultimate crib sheets , 6 month old diaper leaks blowouts sleeping , i easily switch new ultimate sheet they machine washable dryer safe , i love , considering i baby laundry multiple times week putting regular sheets crib mattresses huge hassle , ultimate crib sheet huge help middle night diaper leaks it takes much less time switch change whole sheet i leave baby 's cute sheets mattress use top size : both mine shrank tiny bit dryer , not problem they fit flat top regular crib-size mattress material : the top side breathable , soft cotton layer the bottom side soft , waterproof plastic feel 
-1	i found ultimate crib sheet much trouble 's worth lifting daughter 's mattress takes effort : 's made lightweight foam as result , changing sheets also super easy i lift mattress , takes two seconds on hand , snapping ties ultimate crib sheet takes bending crib five solid minutes ( plus , manufacturer recommends snapping snaps every wash , means snap crib , unsnap , snap wash , unsnap , snap crib ) so , foam mattress corner room , i 'd suggest getting normal sheets stay-dry liners if coil mattress keep crib center room , means , try ultimate crib sheet 
+1	my mom said get enough crib sheets something change constantly i drawer full crib sheets never used ! this best thing ever ! put one , one emergency it soft , cotton excellent quality work crib changing 3 morning went 10 minutes 1 minute ! nothing bit 9 minutes extra sleep middle night 
+1	really hand hospital ever tried change crib sheet middle night kids either puked peed no one happy , everyone crying this simplifies still lets see adorable sheet set overpaid the snaps much easier deal sheet super absorbent we two accident - one gets replaced dirty one washed 
+1	i really wish i son newborn midnight crib cya gongs could avoided this really great easy use product it definitely one first things i recommend parents i 'm glad around second child make sure tha buy backup one teo late night changings this came handy 18 month old went potty training leakages accidents kids sometimes have my complaint washed wash , snaps would break also , side note , cheap amazon , i also able find brand tjmaxx marshalls half price 
+1	i really like sheet ! it keeps rest son 's crib sheets dry , easy take clean i two i wash one use especially great nighttime leaks need change baby sheet get back bed ! 
+1	i recently attended baby shower gave gift the mother requested couple since given birth sheet working well great idea baby shower gift 
+1	i absolutely love sheet ! changing babies sheet effortless , thanks great invention just snap one snap another one on- convenient , especially middle night changes ! a couple snaps fallen time , 's big deal , sheet still work- i highly recommed sheet anyone baby ! 
-1	the concept product good , i found snaps extremely difficult snap unsnap ( maybe get easier little wear , i n't used enough see ) therefore , i found quicker easier take mattress together use fitted sheets ( also attractive ) i would use product mattress/crib set fit making extremely difficult get mattress seems like crib mattresses slide pretty easily , making product pretty unnecessary 
+1	these sheets i ever used son 's crib i bought one regular sheet cover mattress , i 've never taken i use ultimate crib sheets i three ; i would recommend number i ca n't imagine much pain would lift crib mattress change sheets so easy snap , snap , snap 're done ! i never dry mine dryer i hang drying rack 's usually dry hours i want mine last , using dryer tends wear i 've never not one hand , 3 total 
+1	we something similar leftover daughter baby i wanted another , i n't ablt find exactly pad job 
+1	i love sheet ! i 4 ( 2 child ) it super absorbent stays place ! they great potty training accidents one unfortunate night stomach flu i used wrestle matress changing sheets not anymore i pretty sheet matches bedding bottom crib sheet top now middle-of-the-night accident i unsnap cirb sheet , pull , put clean one place this one gifts i give baby showers i think mom without least 2 ( need spare ! ) 
+1	they easy put ( change 're half asleep ) really protect baby 's sheets i three right ! you need careful washer dryer ( washer sometimes ripped backings dryer sometimes broke snaps ) worth ! 
-1	the reviews say product soft pretty old ( 2002-2004 ) recent reviews agree product not soft somewhere line must tried save money made product i would n't sleep not use son 's crib as far protecting sheet probably says i 'll never know since i 'm returning 
+1	this best crib sheet ! it simply used fastening straps sides crib used decorative sheet simply placed snugly place it my daughter 6 months leaked diaper occassion , mattress sleeps cost around $ 120 00 , thanks sheet mattress still looks brougt home 
+1	reality n't , really helps simplify life you n't take crib bumper lift mattress take crib sheet instead , unsnap place clean one top mattress i regular crib sheet ultimate crib sheet decorative purposes case needs placed spare dirty i give 4 stars instead 5 's annoying snap straps prior washing also shrinking occurs 's washed ( make sure put low setting dryer ) also , expensive i two 's worked fine 
-1	the strings ripped i tried pull crib i also n't like idea top mattress crib sheets so might good idea n't great baby mattress n't decorating baby space at first i thought product clever , i got i realized useless it 's easy take crib sheet baby 's crib , i really never needed 
+1	so easy use , 's one i ever used ! 
-1	seemed like good idea , i n't care i returned n't soft actual crib sheets much nicer look 
+1	this great product ! buy two put crib when little one leaks night , unsnap toss dirty one aside , 'll clean one underneath as far snaps falling , son pyloric stenosis ( severe vomiting requiring surgery ) i washed 3 4 times day weeks never i permanent snaps fall ( two completely detachable snaps ends i n't even use ) i even washed dried normal cycle ( not gentle ) warm water ( not cold , recommended ) 
-1	i thought i would love help quick crib changes child sick , accident/leak however really annoying weave elastic around crib slats fasten buttons -- really doesnt save time , since mattress cover waterproof i dont really need another waterproof layer 
+1	i ordered two pack one open item sheet looks fine n't seem like used i 'm okay bought less $ 4 ! 
-1	this supposed save time instead changing sheet , i found took long change change actual sheet you reach around crib ( undo ) snaps , aggravating somewhat difficult depending placement crib compared lifting mattress quickly pulling sheet putting new one , i think might actually take longer 
+1	i never changed sheet daughter 's crib instead , i 2 ultimate crib sheets i alternate i ca n't tell awesome 's in general , 're easier change regular crib sheets in pinch ( ie , diaper explosion sick baby middle night ) , make life so much easier just fold sheet contain mess , take laundry room , snap new one , 're good go i 've read reviews said n't like sheet , i love you n't need mattress pad , either 
-1	i 've 2 ultimate crib sheets using 7 months i not like i n't hate , i n't like never purchase the idea wonderful , parts product cheaply made within first washing , snaps pulled sheet ( following directions re-snap sheet washing ) that disappointing thankfully , 2 snaps i still able make sheet function however , take time snap sheet securely n't soft cozy baby it kept accidents leaking work well area , far adding coziness comfort ease use failed miserably i bought mine babies r us instead amazon wanted contribute review regarding product i shop amazon much often i wish i better informed , i would gotten quick zip sheets instead the attachments snaps not well made i would not recommend product new moms go different crib pad protect add softness/coziness crib this sheet also not retain warmth well - even throwing dryer putting crib , cools quickly remains cool may nice summer not winter south dakota one additional note , take long time sheets dry - extra dry cycle dryer not handy helpful 
+1	these work crib slats certain size our slats wide sheet would not snap around we jerryrig crib adding plastic hooks snaps could fit around this wo n't work us baby gets older i like sheets easy change , clean well allow keep crib safe without add lot bedding this product works well halo sleep sacks 
+1	love i dont ' keep washing crib sheet this makes easier keep baby 's bed clean 
+1	the summer infant ultimate crib sheet useful product it protects sheet , eliminating need change crib sheet diaper leakage spitting it goes seconds - helpful mom , especially middle night it large enough cover whole crib surface it seems waterproof yet n't make baby sweaty my concern would since attaches crib rails , outside chance baby could loosen/undo strap i think would handy two rotate i like would recommend 
+1	did not know initially i registered first baby had one first year now second baby ordered three ! they made nights baby got sick much easier ! our first one pill cloth side baby n't mind still serves 's purpose 
-1	i tried baby 's standard size crib , fit horribly the little loops hold , n't seem safe ! ! ! and n't keep sheet secure mattress i n't know 're allowed sell they seem like major safety hazard ! ! ! total waste money ! ! ! 
+1	seems fit fine except corner snaps could longer we sorelle rosa crib hidden hardware snaps must go around outside two bars corner the straps not long enough effectively go around 4 corners no big deal though two corners go around first set bars far side so sheet offset couple inches n't appear enough slack become safety issue if baby start try get sheet n't seem like difficult task add strap extensions we 'll probably buying allow time laundry runs 
+1	this pad worked well son he 3 5 years old trying potty train night it 's nice not wash entire sheet mattress pad every time small accident it never leaked 's washed many times still retains waterproof quality the reason i took one star 's little stiff resistant bed first he got used working fine 
+1	accidents happen little kids , really easy way make sure bed kept clean dry especially loft bunk bed n't want climb , tear apart 
+1	for training pad super easy use , wash make acceptable kid have 5 braved diapers night early 
+1	this excellent mattress pad use potty training it 's also good time case leaks it 's absorptive easy put take 
+1	i absolutely love handy 's plus pad i purchased 5 full-size pads son year half ago i think great my 4-year old slept full-size bed since turned 2 these pads really work ( leaks ! ) , comfortable wash-up well i 2 complaints 1 side-flaps n't quite long enough fully tuck pillow-top mattress ( although make work one side bed wall pull opposite side really tight ) and 2 top bottom pad tend `` curl '' several washings despite complaints , i not able find pad even near quality comfort one the reason i 5 , truly want `` full '' coverage bed child rolls sleeping , need use 2 slight overlap ( , 2 use 2 back-up ) i also use one ( full-size ) spinmaster flip-open sofa keep spills accidents staining sofa the full-size fully covers full-length sofa i think `` must '' product parents toddlers n't want constantly changing bed sheets trying `` wash '' children 's sofa really n't meant washed ( fyi if like basic comfort 's ultimate crib sheet , 'll also like handy 's plus pad the handy 's plus pad basically ultimate crib sheet side flaps without snaps in fact , pad portion handy 's plus pad - full size almost size ultimate crib sheet ) 
-1	this okay diaper pail money it n't totally eliminate smell bags hard change i n't even try 'twist ' bag , i take lid it easy open i wonder son getting gets older if afford , 's not bad 
-1	my husband i picked diaper pail i pregnant son friends told us get one uses regular garbage bags that turned perk diaper pail the springs popping since first month my son 10 months old recently one springs broke , completely gets rid supposed & quot ; odor-free & quot ; feature ( i found n't exactly true either ) now expecting baby # 2 i going buy another diaper pail replace one my advice : do n't waste money it 's efficient throw diapers regular trash 
+1	we used pail 3 years , 2 kids the advantage pail n't require special bags we change bag twice week you save lot money get sheap bags dollar tree big lots ( works 10-cents bag ) it get stinky sometimes , garbage pails every child extra stinky diaper occasionally roll save money 
+1	purchased unit hold adult size large briefs pleasantly surprised holds approximately 8 soiled briefs virtually smell emitted ( except adding pail ) i wish held i 'm happy something helps & quot ; unmentionable & quot ; problem i really not concerned small-ish volume i 'm trouble finding replacement deodorizer disks though may use stick-on unit something new one required 
+1	bought keep toddler unplugging important plugs ( ie : tv , chest freezer , etc ) it works well extremely secure i actually tough time getting the narrowness makes not work adapters thick cords and two small openings bottom unit thinner normal sized cords i hard time getting thicker cords ( surge protector chest freezer cord ) i actually broke bottom section separates two cords larger cords would go easily when i i actually able put one cord per cover recommend thin plugs , adapters good buy price 
+1	i bought help baby proof house my son gets everything ! ! these covers fantastic they sort hard get open installing there way son able open he 's tried ! haha only problem , n't prevent pulling wires so still need vigilant : ) 
-1	there two pieces outlet cover : back part replaces outlet cover ( needs screwed ) front cover , released back cover squeezing two plastic pieces sides the plastic side pieces part back part , made stiff plastic extremely difficult squeeze this outlet cover also not fit one outlets ( would not stay flush wall ) 
+1	this things install quickly easily 're running standard cords ( lamps , etc ) though holes if want run something thicker ( like wire one power strips ) i found i bit modification make fit i ended trimming gap larger backside plate trick i think ones i got difficult enough keep son opening i 'd consider fence outlet i 'd want access time , someone arthritis would probably want stay away 
-1	i couple major issues outlet cover # 1 : the screw probably existing wall outlet covers not long enough accommodate outlet cover they made much thicker outlet cover replaces , i need go purchase handful screws # 2 : box not big enough accommodate anything except basic , small , two-prong plugs so wo n't fit ? our laptops , phone charger ( samsung galaxy small box plugs wall ) , ipod chargers , computer charger , power strip plug , light dimming plug attached lamp , dslr charger , baby sound machine , verizon fios plugs well crap appliance plugs did fit , ask ? a lamp just one lamp oh , electric toothbrushes useless , sending back the safety 1st units square ( not pyramid shaped ) hold various plugs 
-1	the slots cords bottom cover small i wanted able thread powerstrip 's cord -- meant thin wires like lamp something -- not thick wire also , would n't cover box cell phone charger , either this basic wires plugs 
+1	these designed cover plugs leave plugged , lamps alarm clocks , keep kids pulling plugs/cords damaging injuring and 's exactly we use several home problems they 're also easy install simple screwdriver many negative reviews complain either hard open ( completely point ) holds `` small '' ( aka standard ) plugs , obvious description picture , 're not really fair 
+1	i 18 month old twins , older child cerebral palsey , hospital bed downstairs get together day evening babies always getting cords , pulling wall , came amazon ( found ) goes even thick cords hospital bed ( 3 prong ) well worth money babies completely given cords : ) 
-1	these complete hassle pry apart install my mom i held side pulled , nothing i finally shove latches far i could get apart since seems way take cover , i leave latches pushed , defeating purpose keeping kids pulling definitley something i would use permanent fixture it 's much hassle take every time need plug something i plugged i needed not intention switching 
+1	i gave product 4/5 stars couple reasons : pros - mostly keeps fingers away plugs sockets ca n't reach sockets little fingers , durable , hard child take apart , completely kept first son away cons - harder adult quickly put together take apart , n't keep little extremely curious fingers top hole area ( though ca n't reach part would shock ) , n't stop son unplugging cord since space cord pulled upward plug comes socket the plug wo n't come box easily , still unplugged , since 's harder adult get fingers top part plug back , taken apart plugged back in overall , 's done job well , big n't perfect ( though i doubt anything ) 
+1	i love thing it fit large power strip easily also easy use i would highly recommend 
-1	the cover i could find would n't fit power strip i ordered one it seems sturdy fit fine , opening way big my 8 month old could definatly fit least fingers way touch plug problem i could i decided keep put clear packing tape around opening 
-1	i returned product due several reasons : - it bulky- i ended pinching finger installing ( not want child since trying figure open ) 
+1	i love product keeps son safe i enjoy i reach skinny fingers unplug one thing still leave power strip cover son still not get it great especially christmas lights going 
+1	this cover alright , hole seem bit large n't quite long enough biggest power strip , i yet find cover , i ca n't dock stars 
+1	this perfect baby proofing tool the strip cover cover standard sized power strips there hole side power strip plug outlet wide opening top connect devices plugged it really easy put together- snap shut 3 places it also easy adjust button side allows slide different sizes overall , best power strip cover i 've seen 
+1	so far , 2 year old able pull cords , n't able get little fingers near outlet , really important part one nice plus actually neatens look power strip , instead making look tackier 
-1	really ? how could possibly useful ? i saw somebody else post baby 's hand fit inside i thought exaggerating really , i reach fingers easily poke metal object even easier the baby 's whole hand fits giant gap plus thing huge like almost big shoe box and really ugly i n't know 'll replace since others n't sound better , i know point decorating living room baby proofing show there 's way i could leave baby i room , i might well leave cords 
+1	we used behind tv connects cords it works well keeps cords pulled 
+1	this best power strip cover i found we tried mommy 's helper cover n't shut securely n't fit larger plugs 
+1	nothing special job covering suppose unfortunately still draws attention 9 month old baby but nothing gets past anyway ! it safer wires/plugs anywhere babies see cant least makes impossible get outlets 
-1	it 's funny many people positively reviewed yes , 's convenient , easy use , fits well what n't actually effectively cover plugs ! it 's trivial small child fit entire hand rather large opening in fact , i plugged something without remove cover if i fit hand , child and n't even begin protect child sticking metal object this product , word , worthless i recommend getting one power strips sliding covers individual outlets , simply placing standard child-proof covers outlets existing power strip but please n't use product think adequately protecting child shocks 
+1	i bought returned popular brand power strip cover n't fit iphone/imac chargers this one and adjusts lengthwise make pretty long need some reviews mention size opening top - 's true , 's surprisingly wide , i usually reach enough pull plug i need , rather opening whole thing so could kid conceivably pull one plugs n't want him/her ? sure , cover also tall enough would pretty darn hard stick fingers open sockets bottom line : treat deterrent not substitute knowing kid 's playing power cords 
+1	easy use ! 
+1	great option covering outlets little fingers easy use store away adjust different lengths pressing buttons 
-1	seriously , i got , product not worth single penny it bulky gets way even smallest setting ! not , large opening top cords fit , gap big , kids still unplug cords play 
+1	this power strip easily keeps breast-pump plug secure it also covered well plugs : ) easy use sturdy 
+1	i believe product would prevent child tampering power strip , plastic quite thin i worried i used would break as i installing i tried careful seemed though plastic quite thin 
+1	this works pretty well keep little hands grabbing power strips it also option hanging wall i really like the things i not happy quality plastic seems flimsy also hook last hole due size power strip barely stays together for longest strip duct tape around entire device make sure stays together other 's decent little contraption job 
+1	although unfortunately medium sized power strips ? i could n't get cover living room power strip electronics n't quite long enough great smaller/medium sized power strip though 
+1	essential process baby-proofing living daylights apartment/house , i this product not makes powerstip safe kids , also allow chords neat casing not floor 
-1	this powerstrip cover pointless any child get hand get shocked 
+1	my little one looooves plug ins this product prevents unplugging electronic devices , trying plug things power strip , flipping power strip position it keeps child electronics safe ! my critique item seems bit flimsy fully extended the power strip entertainment center pretty standard length size fits strip cover cover extended fully when extended , cover wiggle , wiggled enough , little hands could possibly figure separate two pieces , thus gaining access power strip in effort avoid scenario , i placed product placed far enough entertainment center child would really reach get , level concentration would take reach power strip open cover beyond capable doing i still satsified product despite weakness fully extended , however , i placed bare power strip exact location , daughter problem reaching power strip flicking position furthermore , seeing cords , outlets , plugs motivated move power strip could reach better within matter moments , would happily turning , unplugging things , trying `` plug '' foreign objects so another thing product succeeds making power strip less attractive covering things likes them- buttons , plug ins , outlets if device readily accessible ( ie : open ) i think daughter would problem figuring open thus rendering useless it might not problem smaller power strip product would n't need fully extended 
-1	many kids able remove safety devices less 30 seconds it takes less 5 minutes parent leave room get something return find child hanging cords dead ! ! ! it safer spend money go cordless ! ! ! but must keep corded blinds , get fashion wand ( approved pfwbs ) go parents window blind safety ( pfwbs ) website read testimonials kids died severely injured blind cords watch videos kids bypassing breaking safety devices cords less 30 seconds and decide want install safety kit remove danger altogether 
+1	there perfect solution window blind cords , i think well i actually used kind years ago pets i usually open close unwind , okay what important put cord high child 's reach i ordered many rest windows however , kid 's room kind screwed wall wraps cord around , chance plastic parts falling 
-1	this product useless after installed , i could still open oven door pinky finger the directions also unclear picture n't match product 
+1	this device keeps oven shut despite toddler hanging oven handle ( fortunately , phew ! ) i tried different lock prior one , i returned lock kept flopping inside oven whenever open this one not problem it easy install , works areas tight clearance 
+1	it 's pretty hard find great oven lock this one terrible reviews , kind needed new oven ( side lock ) we 've using 9 months , toddler ( almost 2 ) seems quite safe she 's pulled handle oven times ( 've told `` '' , seems accept time ) lock stayed put she 's tried operate lock times , not successful either i see toddler interested lock able figure , easily diverted it it 's held great , i n't find cumbersome lock/unlock whenever i use oven ( pretty often - i cook lot ) i complaints 
+1	does supposed basic easy use little ones ca n't figure 
-1	my 15 month old daughter able pull thing apart little effort i would not recommend 
+1	these locks took time install , however follow instructions goes smoothly the time well worth ease future plus , daughter outgrown need cabinet locks i put inactive mode this great future company reactivate home childproof just careful cheap cabinets drill entire door ! definitely wonderful investment 
+1	these locks not beat they featured hgtv baby-proof house i found first place they not opened all child , unlike many items you not key open door , know manipulate open if chemicals store within child 's reach , better way lock make sure child safe i feel blessed i found locks exist little one extremely curious figures everything ! trust , wo n't disappointed regarding installation , husband not handyman - 's musician figure , anyone else buy ! 
+1	i read directions twice installed taking less 15 minutes i pretty clueless putting things together one thing changed says outside drill used directions says not use drill the screws small drill would pointless i like comes paper guides screww needs first time instead trial error making many holes cabinet 
+1	we locks installed cabinets home i 've tried brands without success kids always figure way get with system , try want not get sometimes doors require pressing open , i figured out i never issue opening doors this system choice additional homes buy later i n't think i 'd ever want change positive experience i would definitely recommend friend family member , without hesitation ! 
+1	as everything parent , locks complicated 'd thought ( would like ! ) : screw-mounted magnetic locks : the safety 1st tot-lok locks difficult install , especially drawers , flexibility install lock adhesive locks seem secure still , people may want try adhesive locks ( see ) first , make easier get child proofing done quickly pros : + very nice & secure installed , especially since fit adjusted give tight lock closed + works vertically horizontally , side door top + can easily switched hold lock open , children aroundcons : - complicated install , especially situations so might not get around installing , given demands time - requires drilling hole partway cabinet door inside magnetic part , plus small holes attach- may require new tools - collar lock , keep drilling door ; right angle chuck tight spacesif plan home , want finished , secure set locks , tot loks may good choice one note , use often magnetic key wear finish rubs adhesive mount magnetic locks : the kidco adhesive mount magnet locks work spots , 's still good lock try first , lot people , works well ( right situations ) easy install buy see work cabinets once 've tried , 's lot easier see 'll 'll work wo n't work pros : + quick install , minutes figuring out+ no drilling required , less work damage furniture cabinetscons : - only installs horizontally ( along top edge door drawer ) , given way use gravity lock we use adhesive mount , additional screws , furniture n't want drill holes they seem strong enough far , especially since kids seem give trying door - wo n't open , lose interest i n't know adhesive would stand long term use really heavy pulling hook locks : the advantage either magnetic locks old fashioned hook type ( like themommy 's helper safe-lok cabinet door drawer lock ) hooks lot play ( open little bit give access lock ) so child bang back forth - might not open door drawer , make racket maybe ok situations , not great solution easily accessible drawers doors slide locks : slide locks ( theamerican red cross cabinet safety slide lock ) quick easy install , fit but also pretty easy kids unlock , within reach n't much barrier older kids and even younger kids sometimes open pulling pushing doors however , good temporary solution useful carry travel flex locks : flex locks ( like safety first cabinet flex-lock ( see reviews ) orcabinet flex-lock 2-pack ) strong easy install , see looking whether lock secure ( unlike magnetic locks , designed sight ) so might want use critical spots sink ; use travel and bonus , secure even adults ca n't open ! ; - ) ( they take two hands open ) not attractive , job keep tightened 
+1	this product great it 's not super easy install ( lock requires 6 screws plus one hole door ) if take time , ready instructions , plan , execute ; works great you patient each door took 5 10 minutes in less 1 hour i able unpack , read instructions , plan , get tools , done 4 doors i think wo n't work hollow doors maybe doors thick mine pretty standard i love 's hidden pretty sturdy due bunch screws holding the adhesive ones easy install i bet son would open time 
+1	after many years fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks ( cat likes get things ) seeing son still manage pinch fingers doors ( better getting chemicals whatever , still ! ) , pediatrician recommended us they easy install , ca n't get doors open , pinched fingers getting something n't they also mechanism keep lock open position , like need get cabinet lot , kids older n't need anymore i would however recommend keeping extra key around case one gets lost , locked cabinet accident 
+1	these locks fantastic , wow , pain install the directions useless , kind trial error my husband drill redrill couple times get lock right place would work i would recommend locks cabinets/drawers dangerous/harmful goods inside it 's worth 
-1	this product great concept , but critical flaw the whole idea i need drill big hole inside cabinet door drawer non starter i mean , would spend money nice kitchen drill holes inside doors drawers ? hello ? baby grow eventually locks not needed what holes ? it cute manual says `` not drill door , '' hugh ? why would i want even drill near cabinet doors ? also , happens say door cracks i drill ? who pays ? i know answer one - > me ! soooo product going back non-starter 
+1	i opening home daycare locks approved state washington i really like fact unlocked long periods time , i working kitchen i leave unlocked quickly lock they really not hard install , i watched video you tube showed install went it i going recommend people i know i really think would great grandparents anyone young kids visiting often turn kids not , child locks not feature 
+1	i sure use future , i wanted post saying doctor recommended emery board avoid risk cutting skin newborn nails close just wanted let new moms know i learned 
-1	on first use item sliver metal fell if i not well lit room paying close attention , 7 week old could gotten seriously hurt to add salt wound , i tried return item i got two separate emails seller the first email asked describe defect i responded email after , i received second email asking send picture item ; seriously ! 1 do think i storing sliver metal take picture ? 2 if i described defect sliver metal , product would look original picture item , sliver denotes small piece , seller already picture product looks like 3 if seller needed picture , requested first email , not second email i shop online i limited time i not time respond email trail $ 3 nail clip however , i irritated product seller 's response i decided write review in addition , request return item closed return approval process completed ! 
+1	ordered baby born now started cut nails already nice clippers , easy hold hand 
+1	these n't bad a little awkward use clipper lever - small even small hands tends slip but i 'm guessing case baby clippers it 's fairly easy see 're clip n't need press hard cut nail my handle green , unlike white photo 
+1	very nice 's exactly i expected i defiantly recommend i buying future 
+1	so baby nail clippers tiny ! hard hold , great , fits palm hand i get newborn son 's nails clipped much easier if i could , i would change material grip rubbery texture would n't slide around hand my hands always dry slides around bit , nothing like tiny ones fall hand i would recommend product

+1	honestly , i n't use babies in fact , 's nail clipper choice house 9 kids they wo n't touch metal ones , work really easy even clip nails the thing i would add type metal file clean nails ca n't beat ease clipping things ! 
+1	this baby nail clipper # 4 've tried , search finally it 's sharp enough cut nails first try white bulb pretty comfortable hold what need pair baby nail clippers ? the losers : - safety 1st model 49539 ( holder emery boards ) - grip comfortable clippers blunt therefore useless the emery board useful - dubon baby nail clipper ( kind wear finger like ring ) - safety guard n't catch baby 's skin clippers , makes almost impossible clip actual nail plus , 's not sharp therefore worthless - nuby infant nail clipper - not bad terms sharpness , something way 's designed makes really difficult get baby 's nails search ends , thank goodness ! 
+1	it always difficult getting reading thermometer sick infant with product , given infant would used pacifer , works wonders for friends expecting little one , must

+1	i like tub , fits sink well , folds nicely my daughter 4 months old still fits 
+1	i bought another tub initially - friend told one i stick daughter outgrows a must 
+1	my husband and i liked this tub because we could fold it up and put it away in the linen closet it does tend to leak at the hinges though causing the water to get cool very quick we used to keep the water running into the tub the entire time we were bathing our son and this worked out great the water was always the right temperature and our son loved the splashing from the faucet i recommend this to anyone with limited space for an infant tub 
+1	i used tub borrowing friend four stage bath system bad cutting baby 's legs this okay - soft , problems like four stage , however folds hinges tend leak also , ca n't fill level would want way reclined the back still slippery despite nonslip matt we used weeks bringing tub mom washing way 
+1	my mom got tub daughter right born we used since able take bath , 's 4 months old i liked could folded , i never actually put away unless company since i use daily it leak hinges my daughter comfortable since born winter , i gave bath bathroom i could get really warm it fit kitchen sink though i still give bath bathroom , sit tub big tub it uses less water , head elevated , 's little higher she n't outgrown yet , plenty room it great tub , great price ! 
-1	i got shower gift the first time i used tub baby kept slipping around tub she wound sideways entire bath i never used i would soon put bathtub put couple inches water tub bathe baby way rather put contraption i rn quite used giving baths different settings not inexperience talking i currently put safer bather ( read review ) put tub alone baby loves bathtime 6 months old lets say tub downstairs rest lawnsale stuff year 
+1	i used tub 1st son almost 4 years ago i bought new one 2nd son born year living apartment , tub great small spaces i use big tub i done , i rinse leave dry when dried , i fold put cabinet the reason i giving 4 stars i buy sponge use top order keep son slipping but considering folds storage , not big issue it 's great tub otherwise 
+1	i n't problems tub i used another tub son first 3 months , tub became small , i purchased one i 'm glad i did at 3 months , son large age , unable sit yet , tub perfect i 've given 4 stars instead 5 i agree comments not easily collapsible store , bulky , simply let dry bathroom overnight store crib day - space turned not much problem i issues tub leaking though once completely extended , good seal not leak i continue recommend tub friends it 's accomodating longer tub there well worth money 
-1	i looked everywhere tub without grooves baby 's body - i wanted something would submerge nicely neck looked like would trick unfortunately , n't hold water submerge anything perhaps feet leaks horribly , bulky - gave , returned , bath baby nothing works better hands slippery baby anyway , avoid sore knees bathroom tile stiff back bending tub 
-1	i hate tub ! ! ! it leaks everywhere i not recommend buying item 
-1	i wrote review months ago i edit i followed directions , i careful patient tub , i washed dried use still i find things growing crevices top bottom the design idea good n't practical baby tub need used regularly the sling slips place time bath ring n't worth extra work takes clean little ridges hold tub no matter hard i work 's impossible keep tub clean 
-1	i registered tub i thought cool multi-functional after baby born passed stage dry bath , i found tub not easy use my husband i coudl n't solve leaking issue it also difficult expand close tub the sling not good , either i tried use tub 3 times returned i got sure comfort deluxe instead i think sure comfort deluxe much better choice new born it easy put sink the green net comes tub easy use 
+1	unfortunately , i not able find bathtub anywhere ( ( my son used 6-7 years ago ) it great ! it one bathtub baby not slip forward n't go water this blue gear awesome i not understand discontinued i not care leaking i not notice used adult bathtub if somebody has it , please , i will buy from you 
+1	i registered bath tub recieved shower gift everything tub works well my son slide sling i put back but i n't think 's possible not happen 's actively moving whole time i 've never problem leaking the suction cups get stuck hard i really pull get much i pulled one suction cup last time ( it went back easily ) but theres reason stick much keep son safe so i glad tub would recommend others 
-1	70 % time , tub n't leak the 30 % leak , however , fiasco here 's happens : once tub full expanded clips side `` clicked '' place ( yes , read instructions ) fill tub once finish bathing , slide entire unit forward enough drain hangs edge sink let water drain it point moving tub , suction cups stick counter moving tub , unhooks clips come waterworks all hardwood floors and let tell , n't easy remedy holding wet , squirmy baby mothers ( fathers ) far better things time fiddle damn clips mop huge mess my husband , md engineer says obviously incapable maintaining reliable seal look ! meanwhile , 're shopping different type tub we cuss much using one 
-1	i registered got home put together it didnt seem fit together right i took back bought basic tub foam bear pad lay much better less $ $ easy use 
-1	tub leaks - put bath tub use , really hurt back made nervous taking daughter tub trying stand couldnt use kitchen counter unless wanted everything get wet doesnt open close easily - gave one bruise ( due pinched skin ) trying open close also , time child sit might well put big tub my daughter slipped slid tried sit up too short - time 4 months , long tub would kick sides i regisered eurotub , rec 'd preferred euortub far ! 
-1	my son 11 months old i using tub since 5 weeks old in beginning , used infant sling , baby would constantly slip water we put large bear-shaped foam bath sponge sling minimize slipping , still readjust quite frequently when learned sit , tried using bath seat feature he would arch back slip forward bath ring , thus painfully squishing private parts we decided try without ring little challenging holding place washing , managed now twists turns wo n't stay put tub i thought buying better tub , since close graduating big tub , i n't want spend money please consider buying something different baby i not using tub next child 
+1	great product little one we put baby tub big bath tub little one loves take baths the first time used i hard time locking i got locked problems i like whole set especially teh suction cups doesnt slide around , sling keep baby laying incline great perfect height keep baby happy it also removable bath ring , using sit 
-1	i excited i recieved tub thinking would last years well , first not use home bathtub , suction cups not adhere non-slip surface most tubs non-slip , 's little bumps tub this fine though , i planned use kitchen counter no matter hard i pressed middle `` locking '' device water always leaked onto counter floor this tub trouble 's worth ! 
-1	i found easy use sticks bathtub great , but two month old constantly slipping i keep pulling back onto hammock i would buy one built slanted back short basin baby n't far slide maybe helpful older n't need hammock 
+1	surprised read negative reviews regarding tub two different tubs , got one daughter 5 months old , 's one year old still uses granted , never tried fold since inches n't seem make much difference storagewise , n't know difficult 've absolutetly leaks tub , suction cups still work great bathring works great , moved way baby old enough sit alone although still use bathring daughter cant stand time 's 7 months tub , nothing ever broke , got worn think tub great ! ! ! 
-1	do not waster your money on this tub it is a piece of junk my baby was very uncomfortable in this tub , you also only have one free hand to wash the baby it also leaks from the bottom 
-1	this poorly made baby bath i ever used it impossible get folded unfolded when get figured get deal stupid sling my baby kept slipping ears would get water she big sling , small sit ring i gave fair try , i go buy another bath it seems like great concept , really waste [ money ] 
-1	worst bath tub 've bought returned item right away leaks pulled longer , matter much struggled put extension back together , would n't click pressed lock extension , could n't tell whether locked not , put water test lock system result kitchen counter floor mess now , bought euro bath good job 
+1	we bought 2 , used block computer desk rest family room , block 7 ' wide archway kitchen rest house we soon found sturdy adaptable , tall enough hassle step at least week , husband i catch toe scrape shin stepping so intend use fence corral , either indoors , great buy if planning use fence block wide opening , pay extra money metal version gate ( toes ) much happier 
+1	we bought play area keep 15 month old daughter safe worked outside she loves plays well it easy set tear takes matter seconds best , light easy carry , well excellent carry strap 
+1	this product godsend ! i use carpeted area 7 month old infant , crawl around hearts content safe wall outlets , small objects , etc i also planning getting extension , make play area even bigger the 'superyard xt ' also great puppies , humane crating hours my complaint , minor , gate opens ( get 'superyard ' ) awkward somewhat difficult work there easier swing open type gate thing , mommy daddy quickly enter leave play area 
+1	i recently purchased yard twins ( ( nearly 8 months old ) ) started become mobile i yet baby-gate entire house , i super-yard'ed family room ! i shaped square , alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside , protect carpet the boys enjoy able actually see holes , able play many toys ( ( rather confined pack n play ) ) it pretty sturdy used properly , i mean i adult fall , obviously would collapse it does fold , not compactly , i would say would most-likely take entire mini-van trunk i travel looking compact on-the-go type play-yard , look else-where i like configure fit oddly-shaped play area , even remove/add panels ( ( sold separately not buy ) ) make larger smaller also , due plastic ( ( well rounded i may add , sharp edges ! ) ) able start bringing outdoors well weather improving ! i also planning purchasing another one use `` gate '' 2 over-sized entrance ways family room my husband believes screw 3 hooks ( ( full hole , not 1/2 hole ) either side door frame , attatch strong zip-ties hooks holes gate , work of course , damage walls , solution i see fit large doorway ( ( please note not meant stairs , doorways they not baby gates creative suggestion i thought i would mention ) ) and , one friends owns one , used surround christmas tree last year , i thought amazing idea ! i think boys master crawling , eventually walking super-yard prove even valuable ! 
+1	this one products husband i would buy hesitation we bought year ago ( extension ) used every day since when daughter outgrew octoganal arrangement , opened used block kitchen dangerous areas she not climber yet , i not recommend using fashion child it tip , circular formation sturdiest we n't problems pieces breaking plastic brittle adjust almost daily highly recommended

+1	we got superyard ( , i call , & quot ; steel cage death match & quot ; yard ) contain child living room den working this experience your mileage may vary plus side : the fence robust basically indestructable in 's four five sided form , 's stable , even toddler rage ! ( & quot ; attica , attica ! & quot ; ) the sides taken apart , make smaller areas minus side : folding locking mechanism stiff , i afraid i breaking first i opening so far 's not much problem the whole system pretty heavy , not nearly portable try tell also , 's pretty clunky large , 's , keep the major downside price ack 
+1	we love thing i read reviews i bought thought would tough & quot ; unravel & quot ; n't bad i expect new product not pop right position , formed hexagon rather easily that 's key -- -no assembly required ! my daughter 7 months old pushes front arms tips onto back , occasionally bonks head & quot ; wall & quot ; pen she gave nice red spot head hit & quot ; hinge joint & quot ; part pen concerned , would n't effective n't sturdy the mesh lattice walls seem little give to remedy best i could , i placed stuffed animals larger toys front corners i still think rare head bonks good trade huge catastrophies would occuring daily house she n't protest put sense freedom scoots around still able see us and keep eye well it perfect size not intrude living room space big enough hold ever-growing little body ton toys we bought second one upstairs 're going try connect together outdoor occasions

+1	this gate could easily 5 stars , points need mention , gate needs improvement if 'evenflo ' addresses , gate easily merit top score let start positives the gate made sturdy aesthetically appealing wood it works well looks great , if install goes well , exactly specified ( included paper template great ) the mechanical 'lock latch ' inspires confidence actually feel hear 'click place ' , gives one peace mind of course , one hopes 'evenflo ' determined type latch one not 'easily defeated ' age group manufactured/intended ( 6 months 2 years ) ! thankfully , seem like task i also like fact bottom latch receptacle allows gate slide , thus adding reinforcement both top bottom portions gate way go 'evenflo ' ! the negatives gate follows in many typical installations , baseboard molding/trim may get way installing bottom-most latch receptacle it case , even carefully measuring proper clearance floor , specified assembly directions thus , i n't able get latch receptacle clear molding order screw bottom screw i thus cut ( hacksaw ) portion latch receptacle , 'modify ' installation i able use 1 screw ( although larger longer one provided ) , instead 2 , install bottom latch receptacle thankfully , even modified 1 screw installation tight secure going door jam wood 'evenflo ' provide consumer least another type bottom latch receptacle allows better clearance molding near floor besides , most typical homes do kind baseboard molding , mine 1/1/2 '' high , hardly anything large lastly , assembly directions not make clear latch receptacle use top , bottom they not dimensions , one thicker ( top latch receptacle thinner thicker bottom one ) of course , aforementioned 'latch receptacle ' install challenge may not even apply installation , especially n't floor baseboard molding in summation , gate sturdy excellent , good value please , make sure install correctly ( per instructions ) , never leave baby alone unsupervised these gates meant used with proper supervision , never replacement

-1	i hate gate quality typical evenflo if i noticed evenflo , i wouuld not wasted time it pain install total pain then , 's unlocked , slides adjustment the thing , way stop baby sticks arm slates open broken badly bruised arm we put screw wood would slide little help prevent if known second risk , would taken the next morning , kid tested yeah , kid push bottom comes bracket causing gate bend foreward so far , i seen kids push foot position major stranglation hazard not mention broken bones the wood flimsy twist every way as far function goes , go unlock , sometimes not unhook slot i pratically hang get open also , gate leans when opened , leans ball would roll end gate not sure came we gate couple months my son able push since started crawling my 2 yrold almost squeeze pushing lead getting stuck i made bathroom break not good gate evenflo needs stop every product i crap i afraid buy carseats if ca n't make good simple baby gate , i would n't trust child 's life carseats we plan replace within next couple paychecks 
+1	we love gate ! we purchased two , one top stairs one downstairs let tell reasons baby gate buy 1 you take gate part not needed , yet safe enough top stairs 2 even 5 year olds still not open all baby gates become useless soon kids figure works 3 you buy extra sets hardware move gate around depending circumstances 4 it 's cheap ! these top reasons love gate give try 
-1	update : 6-months later - sliding mechanism loosened considerably use it slides smoothly without pinching hands i 've found gate strong secure - never weakened popped son tries stand so , buy , try rubbing wax , something , help beginning , pretty dangerous first and also aware little hands still get pinched actual rungs 're opening that happen slotted , sliding gate some negatives i found latch loud , 's also difficult grandma open close arthritis hands and difficult , tries repeatedly noise loud annoying i 'm always afraid 's going wake kids so , mom house lot , get something easier it save lot frustration - ! -- -- -i 've installed little week seriously pinched skin twice what happens unlatch , first slide gate , swing there metal brackets hold two halves gate together , horizontal wooden bars slide along extend contract ( look photo - 'll see i mean ) the sliding movement quite stiff hard i 'm sure use loosen , perhaps i put wax but 're opening gate rush , i today hit sudden downpour i needed run upstairs shut windows , i put much muscle getting darn thing slide , outside hand got pinched beneath metal bracket the first time i last week older son woke yelling i wanted get upstairs quickly woke baby my hand got pinched metal part i thought i need careful but busy parents like us n't time stop think careful opening gate when 've got screaming kids rain coming windows , last thing worry hurting safety gate ! ! i dont ' mean beat dead horse , seriously , 's not good the pinch i got today major painful - i 've got blood blister 's almost half inch long ! 
+1	our house front back split we lot stairs 5 openings stairs ! these gates great sanity at first bought big playard gate opened cover two sets stairs i climb least 100 times day ! now walk-through stair gates easy use holding baby before also gate expanded fit door way attached walls i always concerned daughter would fall steps gate gave way would pull these gates i know locked much sturdier i like slide back forth ; 's easier get entries we used wood matched stair case n't drill post railing i highly recommend gate

+1	i love nice , big playpen lots room practice/learn crawling lots things look : primary colors geometric shapes things side play mat wipes clean n't absorb fluids ( pee , drool , drinks ; wipe , n't need wait mat dry anything ) it 's sturdy easy put together and latches latch easily i think 's rated 30lbs ( child climb , course ) potential drawbacks : -takes lots floor space ( worth extra crawling room ) -it built noise-making toys walls : crinkle wing butterfly & rattle bumblebee neither loud , still , n't detachable & might bother people it also louder squeaky toy built ladybug one side i n't think child could squeak ; fact preschooler knows n't strong enough compress enough produce squeak it squeezed sides -- maybe ladybug wall child could press ladybug wall squeak , 's easily solved putting ladybug facing out -mirror high seen baby child sit own -once 's assembled 's not simple move apart four corner feet , four support feet ( total 8 feet ) wheels ( but many wheeled playpens difficult navigate n't move much either ) -it 's surprising much stands regular room -- big brightly colorful , not going blend adult decor at all i think also comes black , though the black one may not noise-making built-ins , i 'm not sure none potential drawbacks bothered much , bit surprise i 'm still happy -- 's easy assemble one bigger portable playpens available as bonus comes large box aka `` toy '' youngsters ; - ) update : we 've using 6 months love it ! we always moving one year old baby the high walls keep climbing , extra supporting legs handle jumps , falls flops might the built toys walls still great shape ( i 'm still one make ladybug squeak ) it nice play pen big enough actually play 
+1	i 'm grandma shape playpen use children babies except bit larger ( 42 '' square play area vs current 36 '' square play area ) i find shape less confining usual playpens available basically thing putting baby bed playpens n't cute back , every bit handy it not perfectly safe controlled area babies learn play quietly make sense world , provides great peace mind parents grandparents able put baby safe place talking phone something not allow hands-on undivided supervision this unit well built , stable , portable , easy fold ( get hang , 's not exactly intuitive ) how could better ? i would like padding little bit thicker , i would like play area little bit larger ( two babies could play comfortably , like `` old '' days ) , i would like removable washable cover pad instead make own but , review based best available living fully product description

+1	fantastic product our child loves playing pack 'n play even n't put toys inside walls moderately entertaining child the sun mirror ( plastic kind sort warps images ) , butterfly crinkly wings ( fabric plastic inside noise ) , another side bug wings inside final side squeaker ( really hard use ) it 's one piece & # 34 ; assembly & # 34 ; ever required the sides collapsible push button side the ground mat child sits servers exterior case holds pole-assembly together folded and 's light-plastic zipper bag handle serves carrying case it packs long rectangle , probably 1x1x8 feet pros : - pack unpack minute , & # 34 ; assembly & # 34 ; required set lock place like collapsible baby stroller - sturdy build , child wo n't able tip would never fold itself - soft strong mesh walls child see ca n't stick fingers small objects mesh cons : - this minor complaint : squeaker one walls impossible child squeak - press sides wall 's sewn tightly- as side-effect sturdiness 's heavy on plus side , made sturdy materials

+1	after son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item floor home hoarded mouth hours ( unbeknownst us ) , wife i decided wanted another prison -- i mean `` play yard '' -- son roam around apparently 're terrible whole concept baby-proofing so i found item amazon , sleeplessness , thought dimensions 9 ' x 9 ' -- sounded like steal $ 90 we ordered one i bit dismayed box showed turned another pack n ' play like probably parents , already obligatory pack n ' play it 's small cozy son likes fine i told wife bit dismayed : another pack n ' play not want ( she also wondered i thought dimensions 9 ' 9 ' , 's another story ) well , could returned free returns , got set plopped son , hooked here 's 's ten times better average pack n ' play:1 the colors vibrant -- reds , blue , green , yellow -- opposed muted colors often see pack n ' play 2 each wall pack n ' play different feature : instance , one wall ladybug squeaks ; another butterfly moves rustles ; another bee also moves rustles ; another sun mirror although mirror not fanciest mirror i 've ever seen , keeps budding narcissist fascinated minutes time 3 it 's sturdier pack n ' play i 've seen , walls n't budge stands , 's also squishy enough withstand falls i 've seen son fall plenty times inside , n't seemed bothered perhaps caught reflection way down 4 though not 9 ' x 9 ' , 's bigger pack n ' play i 've ever seen ( note : i 've heard cause problems 're using sleep , harder find sheets fit , though apparently find people make special square sheets instead standard rectangular sheets ) 5 our son actually likes going , unlike pack n ' play ( -- god forbid -- north states superyard play yard -- 'd think 'd sent guantanamo bay ) overall , really looks like fun , happy , bright place , 's well made looks like last , perhaps importantly , son n't fuss put , , state obvious , putting keeps away unmentionable hazards floors home so although i n't think need two pack n ' plays , i 'm not sad i made reading error ordered one mistake , particular pack n ' play awesome to sum , 're going buy one pack 'n play , buy one , 's clear winner 
+1	i 'm gon na start saying i really love bottles they work great baby she n't get gas used get bottles anymore seems comfortable nipples plus disposable liners make cleaning much easier faster i love way cap compresses nipple sure accidents mixing formula , except orthodontic nipple little hole one side , n't really use one , n't matter us that said , i must warn it does not come with the easy-feed bottle like description says 's main reason i got set , otherwise i would 've gotten prettier ones apparently n't make easy feed anymore i still gave bottles five stars cuz 're best 've tried helped lot little colicky baby blessing comes cleaning we zillion nipples bottles replace nipples nursers 're good go 
+1	i like bottles better premium nursers here 's why:1 they n't break easily dropped ( thrown ! ) 2 the caps streamlined work different types nipples the clear domed caps premiums n't work orthodontic nipple , 's i use i would rather received 2 sets instead one premium sets i got 
+1	we used playtex drop-in bottles son loved he able hold three months old we started slow flow nipple early nipple confusion later moved y-cut nipple great n't spill like medium fast flow 
+1	since 1st child new grandson , i not remember ever bottle easy stomach prevent colic even colicky babydid best i used nothing else ever done better less hassle cleaning area keep buying inserts , affordable , i bought others ideasmd 's helped develop , n't mean work well , 'cuz n't ! ! ! i 'd go playtex every time 
+1	my 6 week old hated bottles came he choice 5 nipples likes latex slow flow best even husband able feed ease ( breastfed babies picky ! ) i love easily i store unfinished breast milk i recommend everyone it would make great baby shower present ! 
+1	baby less gas fussiness since using bottles quick cleanup , quick fill love nipple variety too because liners , easy keep two bottles use not clutter kitchen bottle pieces , etc would highly recommend 
+1	my breastfed baby took easily bottles they 're sturdy durable the times i 've difficulties leaking i 've failed properly use theplaytex drop-ins disposable bottle liners , 8 oz , 50 liners i wish playtex n't phasing bottles feel much sturdier premium counterparts 
+1	these bottles i get son take he hates silicone nipples , great alternative 
+1	great set , 'll need nipples at least 2 5 fast flow , i n't use baby 8-9 months old the nipples like $ 4 2pk , add cost comparison shopping other , i love bottles ! i n't single complaint i not use bottle warmer they leak diaper bag not kept upright , i store mine upright , 's non-issue 
+1	my daughter n't drinking bottle the laytex nipple one shes takes its soft like breast but i n't know would n't drink bottle i smelled milk it gone bad so i learned heat milk ( not boil ) right pump store good bags milk stays fresh , baby eats 'm work there better feeling ( grandma whos watching ) know shes happy work 
+1	not bad price items included i wish gave nipples though they give several drop-in liners , 4 oz 8 oz but price , worth 
-1	with rave reviews love playtex ventair bottles , i excited bottle yet , baby hated first , bottle huge , makes uncomfortable many ways second , even slow flow nipple somehow seems fast makes baby choke milk in case , used couple times went right back ventair i would not recommend 
+1	we got set shower n't needed bottles my son started using four weeks old quickly outgrew smaller bottles , set includes three larger ones , great the reason i give four stars instead five n't include medium flow nipples , fast slow my baby impatient slow flow overwhelmed fast , purchase medium ones separately it 's also little irritating keep buying drop-in inserts , cut dishes 
+1	several weeks ago i left 2 star review bottles due cost always buy liners twins see i since changed mind deleted review why ? to avoid buying liners since girls 13 months old , bought bottles n't use liner after used only playtex drop ins 1st year using types bottles around month i realizing much not girls loved playtex drop ins the playtex nipples definately girls prefer much easier they normally finish night time bottles not finishing since switching different bottles also new bottles tons air bubbles playtex not the nipple size also good preemie babies when girls born small suckle breast bottles big tiny mouths i remember girls month old advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone given us i tried giving girls ( bottles merrier ) girls hated nipples seemed big small mouths i empty advent pour playtex and i first wrote 2 star review bottles i hated repeated cost buying liners , also i realized fantastically wonderful able throw away liner since 've bought new bottles seems i ever wash bottles many times i forget i leave bottle milk diaper bag place gross , stinky mess then i actually soak bottles bleach water make sure clean with playtex simply throw away stinky liner so i sorry playtex drop ins i ever doubted & gave 2 star review i guess past month never-ending bottle washing & bleaching bottles lesson learned never again i use bottle besides playtex drop ins except water juice , cheap bottles fine that so save time & money buy playtex drop ins especially twins it might cost liners 'll thankful long run my girls like playtex latex nipples best you buy store brand liners , 've used walmart store brand work fine playtex definately best liner keep eye playtex liners do go sale stock make sure plenty hand n't get stuck middle night w/out liners i also liked bags used first i pumping breast milk girls you use different brands bags well 
+1	these bottles always worked daughter easy cleanup bags , less gas she 's night time bottle 
-1	i bought thinking would great i wrong i give baby breast milk hassle i figured i would saving time i would n't clean ton bottles everyday well , n't able heat bottles liners get container dirty anyway warm milk dump back bottle plus keep buying drop-ins if i 'm going clean bottles anyway i 'd rather use bottle i store milk and heat milk in these bottles dont keep air even i would squish air bag put lid , time i went got baby put bib air back bottle also not good go there nothing protect liner bottom anything could puncture making milk leak out i also dont think close like breast feeding 
+1	it 's super convenient everything 's light easy carry around well it 's even better liner recyclable 
+1	this great set the playtex breast milk storage system very easy way store breastmilk freezer , works well medela pumps i 've pumped work 2 months 's gone pretty smoothly i use mix medela storage bottles i especially like liners bpa free 
+1	my strictly bottle fed 11 month old used bottles day one done fine i saved money buying thrift stores - half i bought still boxes half barely used i ended switching older nipple design ( square top ) newer nipples i liked design better it seemed newer design correct suckling i also bought lot new boxes liners thrift store ! my daughter suffered mild gas , nothing major i liked bottles liner idea best friend used them i wish nipples would come two stages though daughter hit 4 months , slow flow slow fast flow fast i ended putting straight pins slow flow boiling pins open holes little it worked fine ! the time bottle ever leaked i used drop-in liners 's n't seated right rim bottle many reviewers complained drop-ins n't hold full 8 ozs correct to solve problem , i simply stuck standard liners i n't buy playtex brand i buy parent 's choice ( pc ) brand walmart another thing careful measurements n't always correct i bought target brand 4 oz liners realized ( several bottles ) 4 oz mark liner 3 ozs the pc liners correct ! all-in-all , i like bottles getting tired liners i currently reading reviews bottles considering switching next child i 'm really liking i 'm reading dr brown 's , possibly try couple brands well i 'm realizing saving tons money n't always 's best daughter we 'll see ! 
+1	the cute , fancy little burp cloths market match babies spit like mine these wash well , absorbent , usually cover enough shoulder/arm prevent clothing becoming mess , soft we could not make without ! 
-1	i exact burp clothes i gave birth 08 son i figured second pregnancy i would buy big mistake made cheaper now see right i going fold half not go clothes i not even think make wash load disappointment worth maybe dime best it kinda hard tell thin unless open package i would suggest passing 
+1	good diaper cloths ! been using first born 1 month old baby will help prevent diaper rash tiring change everytime baby wets cloth though time consuming wash worth problems diaper rash it really hard use cloth diapers whole day use cloth day time disposable night longer sleep 
+1	i purchased make burp cloths i washed , sewed fabric center piece customize we used burp cloths months ! 
+1	i used work nanny i going college i buying lot baby products best friend ( & # 34 ; student loan & # 34 ; - 's i paying back buying baby products , anyway ) know i 7+y experience taking care babies items i 'm buying things i used sitter years i know 're practical work great 
+1	i say i not disappointed warmer , not used playtex inserts bottles ( gets 4 stars ) not sense heat properly makes way hot n't shut my best advice ? read directions ! i shocked little water uses thought i reading wrong do not use water directions say bottle size ! it correct , followed heats bottle perfectly every time all water disappeared light turns 's done i honestly not understand people could say read directions still n't work , hey 's definitely recommend ! if inserts , always use plastic bottle pour a must baby home daddy , grandma , anyone else n't ton experience properly heating bottle ( esp breastmilk ) 
+1	my wife love botles is better way feeding new born i cant wait use 
-1	i kept thinking i must something wrong i 'd read directions try another , stinking , melted bottle ! and milk would scalding hot if n't melt bottle , milk would still cold i also problem playtex ventaire bottles leaking bottom warmer then i smell burned formula kitchen oh ! and melted bottle ! i 'm going back old fashioned way i 'm going heat water microwave let bottle soak it faster , less messy , lots cheaper do n't waste time money 
+1	this awesome product ! once get used using product , huge timesaver it took us three tries get amount water right bottle would right temperature ( not hot , not cold ) before going bed every night , put two bottles ice pack cooler section when baby woke , transferred one bottle warmer it usually done warming finished changing diaper ! you may want order additional ice pack 'll always one ready freezer this bottle cooler/warmer makes easier night want get back sleep soon possible ! 
+1	we tried many bottle warmers one currently use i liked section keep bottles cold well this feature sounds good , real life , n't work well sounds the bottle warmer works ok heating action inconsistent even get water level meniscus everytime this n't good breast milk also heating plate accumulates gunk time time it includes jar food holder heat food , never tried it all decent bottle warmer , compensate re-heat cold water sometimes 
+1	this one favorite products i purchased new mommy i love it warms avent bottles great it took trials determine much water add i great you heat burn not careful it not like negative reviews pay attention use right amount water it does not warm playtex ventair bottles i guess vent i preferred avent bottles anyway the cooler does keep bottles cold 8 hours remember freeze freezer pack day we 2 story house helped us much i first year single warmer also kitchen great well this definitly worth money ! 
+1	we using every night since bought it takes trial error figure water requirement 's ok it 's easy use , look good works great ! i use warm breastmilk cleaning/descaling issue 
+1	i use everyday heat bottles i like keep frozen ice pack bottles store keep cool pour little water front part boil water the directions little confusing much water use , kind learned much water need use keep bottle 4-5 minutes learn trial error or want save money always boil/microwave water put bottle i got gift babyshower i 'm happy 
+1	when first got i thought complicated really n't you freeze ice pack 're ready head bed , bring ice pack two bottles , place cooler fill two measuring water holders slide side when baby wakes take water holder side pour warmer , place bottle press button front warm while 're changing baby bottle warm ready time 're done it takes practice , first 'll probably either overfill water holder not fill enough for 4oz warm dr browns bottle usually filled 6 line , 2 months later 're filling 7 line 5oz bottles vary 7-8 line it seems warmer gets weaker use requires water you also careful not spill formula/bm warmer get sticky wo n't warm bottle well oh move bottle towards front warmer warm quicker if put much water , bottle hot 're not sure start 5-6 line go there there nightlight n't list feature , 'nightlight ' button glows orange press warm bottle it shuts couple minutes bottle done i love thing makes night time feedings almost breeze 's quirks if two floors definitely get bottle warmer , 're budget best 
-1	i 've heard say best warmer available if , parents s o l heating so inconsistent same amount water amount milk produce different temperature every single time sometimes way cold sometimes way hot when heating indicator light turns must right pull bottle continue significantly warm bottle without water medium be sure loosen bottles cap heating check see travel disc not place otherwise , bottles ( esp brown 's ) overflow if happens cleaning inside warmer major hassle milk burned onto heating plate the carrier short mr brown 8oz bottles similar height the tubes provided premeasure water joke the caps hard close open need two really strong hands maybe multiple tools shut flip tops open of course , likely holding crying squirming baby one arm trying open cap not spill water they tried get fancy shape tubes cap forgot make easy use i ca n't believe someone ca n't design better `` mouse trap '' to add insult injury , taps handle supposed hold top bottle storage compartment broke ( picture provided amazon not current model refer pictures posted shoppers ) 
+1	great product i use nights it lifesaver son wakes needs expressed milk instantly having chiller compartment saves trip refrigerator sometimes i forget ice-pack use ziploc bag crushed ice alternate as soon i pop chamber , time i done changing - ready go i agree measuring water confusing i check periodically ensure bottle n't overheat one thing note heats glass bottles super fast vs plastic bottles so need speedy turnaround use evenflo glass bottles - heat 3 minutes ! 
-1	measuring water not comfortable take time actually put water correct measure boiling water micro using warm milk 
+1	i purchased use nightstand keeping breast milk unfortunately i ended feel formula , i used bedside bottle keeper night two bottle fit cooler compartment one fits warmer i absolutely issues item , said 
-1	the idea behind design well intentioned i find design aggravating subconsciously i always go handle move thing , handle connected removable bottle storage piece there 's way pick thing unless grab warmer cup it may seem trivial i like keep thing way ( 's eye sore ) i would rather bottle warmer bottle storage chamber plus , heating inconsistent no matter whether put extra water not , bottles still n't get warm like when first got ( 4 months ago ) milk would actually hot that n't happened 
+1	so glad i bought bottle warmer late night feedings never easier easy use no complaints yet 
-1	this thing stinks the switch never worked always plug unplug plus easily heat bottles we like cooler back travel overall thing stinks 
+1	our bed rooms upstairs i needed second warmer one cooler this best buy reason i simply love couldnt live without it i used every single day far my son 5months works great i never timed much time bottle warmer not i measured water i used i intially bought screaming infant hands night i stopped bothering measurements even rough use still works great never little problem itbut i make sure i clean throughly every week the cooler part awesome , saved trips downstairs middle night being working mom i making things easy me this i recommend highly 
-1	do not buy glass bottles says nothing website box very dangerous gets hot 
+1	ahora la familia descansa mas gracias este calentador de biberones ya que el tetero se mantiene caliente toda la noches hasta que el bebe la necesite , hay necesidad de prender la cocina , solo meterlo en la boca del bebe comerrr 
+1	i used pump first month i not produced much milk great i used as first time mom , i found comfortable easy use i also sterilized pieces day use piece came fine i find i bend forward get maximum output not uncomfortable if plan lot pumping getting double pump might worth extra money quite time consuming one pump overall , efficient pump , complaints 
+1	i nurse baby exclusively stay home mom , really handy go ca n't schedule around feeding times i n't problems let it make noise , 's not noisy i pump home n't bother i used baby 6 weeks problems whatsoever 
+1	this little electrical pump works well it 's problem 's really noisy i twins pump works fine 
-1	i pump registry also given double electric pump ( medela pump style ) i say good thing i had the double pump ! this single electric one not get enough pressure/suction/whatever plus even did work , single pump means double pumping time i know double electric pumps expensive , beg , borrow , get family go gift - need single pump not adequate substitute real pump ! you even rent double pump hospital lactation consultant just n't bother trying one 
+1	i larger , double pump in style i wanted leave work still something home i used pump morning going work i unusually full it 's small light perfect travel i 'm onto baby # 2 use occasionally since i 'm home full time , works well i need it 's efficient lasted 2 babies - medela really great brand ! i would n't recommend 're pumping often sides - get double pump , perfect supplemental pump 
-1	this pump slow unless 45 minutes hour pump 4 ounces , n't get in addition slow , began leaking use sparingly used 5 months it 's waste money around ! 
+1	awesome product , little loud overall job , rented machine hospital tht twice money paid , realizing needed additional time required additional fees , opted purchase keep rather spend rental , great choice made , highly recommended 
+1	this pump good i pump daughter hospital first month life during day i used hospital grade pumps hospital , night i used pump finally buying double electric medela pump i got much milk pump i hospital pump i used electric plug , never batteries it handy pump i n't see nursing mom go without ever pump point , even cereal start medela definitely best pump get , n't even think manual one i never pump since i 'm home baby , i glad i pump it definitely loud , putting folded towel helps if pump lot , afford , double pump way go though takes half time , important baby take care 
+1	this gate grate especially pets stairs the thing i n't like gate hard bend/configure panel gate 
+1	this gate perfect split-level home addition one 24 & # 34 ; extension it job keeping baby away stairs dog n't allowed my husband said easy install the stay-open auto-close features great i plan buying another bottom set stairs the reason i gave four stars instead five i feel like could slightly sturdier abuse three-year-old tries give 
+1	i 'm quite happy gate , although i spend $ 250 make fit bottom stairs i removed left 24 '' panel , replaced 8 '' extension , inserted 3 8 '' extensions right the $ 30 8 '' extensions way expensive get i think ( often arrive scratches rust due extra pole box ) like many kidco gates , instructions could better and would nice mounting hardware metal instead plastic i used 1/8 '' drill bit create pilot holes screwing banister ( rather hard wood ) while may obvious , others might not know , might not know size drill bit use i tried smaller one first screw extremely difficult attach only i used 1/8 '' drill bit go 
+1	we bought gate opening foyer kitchen we ended buying one extension pleased ! ! ! we put together 30 minutes it 's great bend whatever configuration need for us , hesitant drill walls n't another solution now 's installed , definitely feel like safety convenience factors far outway problem drilling walls i definitely recommend gate ! ! 
+1	i love gate ! we spiral staircase continues 3 floors almost impossible block second level this gate solved problems the door not swing closed behind , i like the bar across bottom door low compared gates , inch when door closed secure , much gate swings shut behind the entire system spans 72 '' stable , even 1 year old shakes it this gate great solution difficult areas well worth money 
+1	we two landings use gates work really well the first one little tricky install second much easier i love magnetic latch i know gate close every time it difficult open sometimes i 'd rather open easily child sneak 
+1	we row home low banister i purchsed kidco configure gate along extension fits perfectly wraps around area nicely n't take much room for purpose i gave 5 stars , i feel gate extension bit pricey the gate crafted well , easy install , peace mind well worth 
+1	we used several gates block stairs home frustrated my husband i wish ordered gate year ago ! it easy quick handy husband install base stairs the gait opens easily one hand ( trick pull latch lift gate bit , n't know initially caused us think gate defective reading directions this feature nice toddler pull latch ca n't lift gate open ) the gate also fairly wide , allowing us pass easily , even carrying things the gate automatically swings shut , convenient , also stay open opened 90 degrees would highly , highly recommend gate ! 
+1	i run in-home daycare townhouse addition young children this gate far sturdiest gate i 've used absolute favorite i 4 different baby gates we used previous home surround fireplace use keeping children playroom across large doorway now the gate attractive , ! i n't feel like i 'm keeping children `` trapped '' like gates my issue oldest daughter figured open gate age 2 however , understood obeyed i told why could n't go gate this gate also taller average baby gate , i love 12 month old climber she stacked pillows climbed first gate i installed doorway 
-1	the advertising gate made seem like right purchase , i wrong ! first , hinges gate allow place panels angle not wonderful if 're little forceful , easily break and breaks , 're luck installing gate second , mounting pieces wall fixed position , top every fence panel the wall mounts not shown amazon picture , middle panel ! this became problem i window ledge lower wall mount location third , kidco gate clearly terribly overpriced most people buy extension gate panels make work boy cost add if irregular shaped area room needs gate , i 'd recommend look north states 3 1 super yard gate i bought north states gate total 6 panels ( 12 feet ) not problems i described it expensive , cost less kidco overall , sturdier better made the north states gate placed various angles like kidco north states gate needs amp advertising though n't quite clear kidco gate better price 
+1	we using system two months we 2 5 walls dining room ( play room ) we used 4-5 extensions well we bought new , easy set be sure install studs - infants pull railing kidco pretty easy work they sent free `` templates '' wall i bought screws ( another gate ) i love system the quality great i recommend would purchase another needed 
+1	we really enjoyed since son born we not use heartbeat music setting , seems like two settings 'nature oriented ' i love automatic shut-off voice-activated modes we gone one set batteries already , took seven weeks ( that includes nights/naps i forgot press automatic shut-off ) overall great product useful 
+1	my daughter 11 weeks old , used since born we usually use ocean sound , twice used rainfall seemed like , it 's true lullabies sound mechanical , n't use we n't buy music , anyway we wanted white noise soothe block noises we always use voice-activated mode , first put , go `` shh '' snap fingers start , begins play 15 minutes , whenever cries it take pretty decent sound set , 's okay -- softer noises usually sleep anyway she sets couple times night -- i think ! the biggest drawback batteries despite using voice activate mode , 's 15 minutes time , seem change batteries every two weeks we switched rechargeables , seem die even sooner -- least recharge the unit runs batteries even quicker use night light -- even seconds check baby this hard fathom , considering swing runs much , since daughter born , never replace batteries ! 
-1	good worked ! my baby really liked sounds night light great midnight feedings i three weeks stop working i changed batteries thinking problem next day stop working it n't play music light would not turn i really disappointed buyer beware ! 
+1	when i first product , i used daughter 's crib like intended then i realized could also placed side carrying handle infant car seats i found worked great daughter fussy car she loved soft sounds musical melodies it helped lull sleep the added light also great feature peak rather turning bright overhead light car just make sure placed securely side handle prevent falling 
+1	the first crib shipped damaged shipment , i asked ship another one second one also damaged i able take pieces make useable one it great crib ! it folds rolled 's wheels even folded it assembled quickly so i rate item high , check product receive fedex guys really beat !

+1	i bought changing table matching delta jenny lind crib another store ( shop around best price ) when arrived , husband i set changing table first it easy us set ( although i think would quite difficult one person ) i feel like wood going crack times , places must strained fit together tighten screws , held end , actually much sturdier looks like going take box are nicer , sturdier products ? absolutely , 're going pay difference overall , pleased value product price however , side note , oak crib not match `` matching '' changing table the changing table nice reddish oak , crib blonde we took items back exchange matching set , receive another unmatched set please aware color differences considering purchasing set 
+1	changing cover worked well changing pad helded wash many poopie diapers nice pad along changing pad ( whip clean use use over pad self ( sometimes nephew sticks without oniez ! ) 
+1	the softness cover makes fact stretch bit fit changing pad at least , know 's snug fit wo n't pop ! 
-1	i used i became sore use electric pump the milk seeps pump guard leaks edges onto clothes i would n't even say getting pump 're go good idea leaking milk get leaving clean i buy replacement part bottom part screws base pump cracked sterilizing ( says ) they n't sell one little piece i buy actual pump part it cost nearly $ 30 order part took 2 weeks receive the entire system n't durable made much use also , cleaning bend pump thoroughly practically impossible 
+1	recently , vacation i misplaced membranes medela pump in style breastpump , vital operation the spare parts safe home , hungry boy hands i predicament unable nurse , i provided son breastmilk pumping three times day since birth i concerned maintaining milk supply , not mention discomfort full breasts , i purchased isis breastpump i use avent products like idea able pump right feeding bottle , 4 oz , 9 oz disposable i amazed comfort , control power little hand pump provides in addition , i enjoy convenience not `` plugged '' reduced amount bottles wash i found pump great pinch , weekend away however , particular situation express 30 ounces day order keep little guy , pump in style superior isis speed quantity milk expressed 
+1	i breastfeeding son , since born , 9 months old i could n't done without avent pump as first time mother , i always knew i wanted breastfeed child , lot harder i thought would my son trouble latching hospital , , could breastfeed consistently ( i went lactation consultant worked wonders ) , i pumping breast milk at hospital , provided medela manual pump it painful i eventually got calluses pumping medela pump so i considering whether buy medela electric avent isis , i went avent , much economical buy this pump comfortable , really imitates suckling action baby at first , parts might seem overwhelming , put pump together , 's breeze washes easily i chose disposable system i thought would convenient i traveled take pump , however , i find i use reusable 4 oz bottles lot frequently whether 're taking pump vacation , work , extract milk occasional bottle mix cereal , pump great buy now son older , harder pump much milk ( let-down takes little longer , drinks less , i pump bit ) , 's convenient go run errand , freeze milk 'll always supply hand babysitter 
-1	had not fallen apart one wash , would perfect mattress pad it never even made dryer what waste money 
-1	when i opened packaging i appalled strong chemical smell mattress pad i open windows get rid smell room even i wrapped pad back plastic i ca n't imaging baby room product , let alone sleep ! i also realized need water proof mattress pad crib mattresses days already come water proof cover the non-waterproof cover i got much better choice baby 
+1	i two mattress pads i love they help make extremely firm crib mattress little cozier son they hold well wash fit great simmons mattress it little expensive mattress pads , opinion worth

+1	i still come back end kept dreaded nipple confusion i rate 2nd dr brown wide neck , gas issue they super easy break clean and yes , i problem nipple leaking first however , couple runs dishwasher sometime opening reclosing bottle , i n't problems since 
+1	in midst bottle testing , i avent , mostly cost bit bottles i thought i could test bottle cup , see avent really telling truth said parts interchangeable well , they also nipple selections , depending fast child drinks one thing i wish avent design something bottle i find buy evenflo cool pals 9 oz cup holder , fit great i would suggest getting 2 packs , couple magic cups handles extra spouts ( least 2 green ones 1 white one )

+1	the avent pump kit good i also like carrying bag , subtle good work - even used lunch box done breastfeeding however , nipples kit hard speed slow flow far fast newborn ( i tested milk wrist , i n't get drop - squirts ) there better bottles , keep baby getting much air instead avent bottles , i started using playtex nurser system - means i pump avent bottles pour nurser ( playtex system sells kit pump adapter - not work avent ) this worked fine , though i not pumping work i would not pay extra money kit since i pump work , insulated bag helpful 
+1	i pump first child back 2003 i worked great i work messy the milk always seemed leak underneath plastic insert , i took helped little bit i also probably pump maybe working little too well would stimulate `` let '' panic keep wetting shirt breast i n't pumping , i kept pumping answered phones ! i night receptionist i pumped away working i like comes bag nice stylish i saved i use next baby due sept 2009

-1	i love soft cuddly changing pad cover i also appreciate many colors comes in what i disappointed durability i 3 used year they totally falling apart elastic now , keep mind use disposable `` chucks '' ( blue hospital disposable pads ) top terry cloth changing pad it makes less messy ( especially early ) n't require washing much i also washed cold water baby dreft detergent , hung dry rotated 3 covers have while nice product lasts , i expected durable 
+1	this works well contour changing pad it fits little snugly , corners pad n't exactly stay `` pointy '' new , works well it works even better cut straps changing pad you 're right baby , anyway 
-1	great colors , i like simmons ' contoured changing pad , supposed fit , keep mind washing significantly shrink covers & amp ; terry fabric n't hold well after couple months , already coming apart

-1	not waste moneyi got tried 2 strollers exact one would not work goodyou not move much hard make turn 
+1	i bit hesitant buy booster , although came highly recommended i felt like overpriced essentially offered nothing boy , i wrong ! i 've using booster 2 years it used 3 5 year old 2 year old brother both love the seat comfortable sit , unlike hard plastic seat it n't slide around chair , so easy clean i also like easy take along 're headed grandma 's house no extra straps , trays , pieces worry ! i n't single complaint seat 2 years use well worth money ! 
+1	my 16 month old daughter gotten stage longer wants use highchair booster seats trays ( ie tot-loc , first years 4 1 feeding seat , first years folding booster great products way ) she really wanted sit kitchen dining room table like big girl , n't want sit baby seats allow convert big kid boosters removing trays we wits end reading reviews , decided give try , i must admit bit skeptical nervous using daughter young reviewers said used older child well daughter absolutely loves proud upgrade highchair big kid comfy booster the booster wipes clean easily , sticks chair well , seat non-slip , daugher not slouch side seat like hard plastic boosters best , seat brings perfect height table ( much better fit hard plastic boosters ) appears much comfortable ( not mention picky eater happily eating everything sees ) this booster seat seems completely changed way daughter looks meal time better also , travel case booster comes nice touch , room pack bib small snack well booster we 're looking forward using booster next couple years , since 's portable , need buy one take everywhere go one thing i mention , i would n't buy booster child overly active n't like sit still my daughter problems sitting still extended periods long occupied , kind kid always moving age , i would n't use booster yet not safety belt hold child 
+1	my 2 1/2 year olds highchair terrible , i threw first b-day this chair great , i dont see anything miraculous going on pros-* very comfortable , son always says everything like cooshie* all one solid piece foam , bo creveces get food stuck in* it doesnt slip due material , plus wiggly toddler* sits high enough eat* can easily taken , straps stuff* cute color , not bright pastely* very light weightcons-* is not portable , i dont know i wouldnt want `` travel '' something size large platter everywhere ! * the `` carry case '' cheap really size diaper bag uhh sorry i already one those* leaves feat dangling , although problem occuring many booster seatsthis booster i like i glad i chose i dont really understand amazing changes children booster ( not i denying fact reviews true ) i dont see cooshie could my son still fussy , get feels like , comfortable booster doesnt stop he loves booster loves big bow v s sitting highchair like little brother 
+1	we love booster my 3 year still using i think started using around 18 months we solid oak chairs n't problem reviewers it sits chair almost time 's residue maybe chair finishing your chair need made something `` grip '' chair , wooden chair i tried take dad 's house cooshy leather chairs , n't work it cleans extremely easily , holds securely , works better i could expected 
+1	i must newer version mine stick fine i sharp corners bottom kitchen counters guys job they much thicker cushionery versions ( pricey though ) , i think 're worth no bumped heads ! 
-1	they n't seem stick well also , start come , i noticed leaving sticky residue behind coffee table 
+1	i 'm not judging anyone else , i surprised i read many people wrote coming pulled i guess daughter never tried hard , really stuck tight i 've one set 14 months , bought 2nd set another table 8 months ago , 're not going anywhere i ca n't speak hurting finish wood , since i 've never tried take they n't look bad either , since dark color matches furniture i wish came colors lighter wood 
+1	when baby gets crawling stage , life changes table corners one places must protected little gadget well there tables require corner piece long padding around parameter table due sharp edges , cases , enough i wish little less obvious unless light wood furniture , things stick like sore thumb my concern adhesive ( supposedly comes right ) many months i suppose i 'll find true , meantime i ( relative ) peace mind grandson crawling toddling around priority 1 
+1	i put corners brick fireplace sticks well my one year old son tried pulling without success never tried they large good cushion job the adhesive strong enough 3 months , still three corners i would recommend course , child persistent , i sure he/she would get eventually so far , good 
+1	i really like cd player i not understand low review *yes light dim i not want bright light it nightlite it fine i check baby see fine *the volume not get loud designed fine i put lullaby cd drifts sleep *the timer function great *the reason i not give 5 stars i wish digital readout buttons lite it hard see dark i not like turn light see buttons digital read maybe next version manufacture include *as far cd 's ckipping hit , i solved sliding piece foam play rails crib no space move not skip ***it not perfect trick ! *** 
-1	this item not top quality i n't many company 's products , example quality i n't think i first cover not open without popping hinge needing reattached , batteries lasted two cd 's , volume n't get high , n't even fit side crib being baby business know not crib 's made you much better getting simple boom box play 's cd 's 
-1	what disappointment ! we grateful receive baby shower- something really wanted however , not live expectations the sound quality awful- , quiet even highest volume setting , even worse , extreme static i exchanged another one thinking maybe first defective problems for expensive item quality poor we ended ordering fisher price tape player online really wonderful we love it- buy instead , better quality cheaper ! 
+1	we 've tried several different potty seats best far:1 ) fairly easy clean , integrated design love wipes clean gets messy2 ) built pee guard boys we another seat snap attachment , course got lost daughter using it 3 ) sturdy stable toilet this seat positively sits toilet , son comfortable even long periods timewe tried soft plastic ones , ironically complained lot uncomfortable one highly recommended ! 
+1	fits seats minor adjustment once set one hand operation especially times running kid one hand my daughter likes easy it not heavy case finger gets seat 
+1	fits perfectly toilet easy 23-month-old daughter sit securely she even put toilet 
+1	we 've tried different brands potty seats , far favorite it stays place kids climb instead slipping tipping like seats unfortunately changed toilet seat/lid combo one slow close plastic ones removable hinges easy cleaning , baby bjorn training seat n't fit also , three years ( couple kids ) black rubber handle back started break , i consider minor wear tear overall , i 'd recommend seat others market it safe looks nice 
-1	while i think 's great fit toilet , daughter wo n't sit couple minutes , adjust every seconds says & # 34 ; n't comfy & # 34 ; after great reviews actually recommended sister , n't work daughter i 'm going buy cheap padded one i guess stinks i ca n't return thing pretty expensive 
+1	fits elongated toilet padded cartoon character seats not it 's easy clean - crevices like padded seat the splashguard n't really much boys , son ca n't keep legs close together like mini toilets daycare , conscious not spray pees i think 's bit bulky travelling folding potty seat bring us travelling 
+1	it fits toto oval shape toilet bowl , i like ! and baby loves put toilet bowl sits 
+1	first sat baby 9 months old , 've reduced number diapers significantly , rare # 2 diapers , woohoo ! ! ! course hold baby , 11 months , holding discouraged occasionaly wiping front lip , seems much less ickier cleaning typical potty this fits almost toilets except smaller-sized apartment toilets , though able place toilet seat without trainer fit properly ( kid n't young , probably wo n't need trainer small toilet ) even take people 's homes used successfully everywhere i 'm relieved baby cooperated early potty training , product enabled accomplish 
+1	i like toilet seat it keeps little butt toilet he likes , too good boys , spray looks nice cleans easy 
+1	i love seat i two house one favorite the kids say 's comfortable adjusts fit seat which great , since actually round seat one bathroom oval one i keep one main bathroom , since 's favorite definitely recommend anyone smaller butts ( know , children ) house 
+1	we bought couple stand-alone potty seats months ago daughter 20 months old although mildly intrigued first quickly learned , seemed view glorified chairs rather places business now 's nearing two-and-a-half year mark , decided buy toilet trainer seat see would get engaged potty training process after reading tons potty seat reviews , i decided purchase babybjorn toilet trainer , since 's one market 's made bpa-free , non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead toxic pvc vinyl as added bonus , toilet trainer seat fully adjustable fit practically size toilet seat we oval-shaped , elongated toilet seats home , babybjorn potty seat fits perfectly this toilet trainer n't slide around toilet seat , helps little-one feel secure sitting despite exact fit , toilet trainer seat easy put remove preschooler could probably unassisted there 's handy loop back seat hang nearby easy storage ( we hang apotty hookthat hooks toilet tank ) as i said title review , babybjorn toilet trainer would perfect , handles little-ones hold onto apparently , toddlers first begin use `` grown-up toilet , '' many experience innate fear falling , even using potty seat insert like one handles help alleviate fear giving something hold onto anchor sitting potty seat this case daughter when sitting toilet trainer seat , could n't relax enough urinate , much less bowel movement she would either hold hands grab onto sides ( unsanitary ) toilet seat order steady , even , still could n't relax enough business on hunch , i tried thearm & hammer secure comfort potty seat , colors may vary , one polypropylene potty seats handles the first time used seat , daughter immediately grabbed onto handles peed first time toilet ! however , arm & hammer potty seat small elongated toilet seat , 's not adjustable , constantly slides around daughter and unfortunately , none adjustable potty seats readily available market ( babybjorn , pourty flexi-fit prince lionheart weepod ) , handles i thought doomed stuck ill-fitting arm & hammer potty seat i came across nifty product called `` shandle '' the shandle handle sticks underside toilet seat strong , moisture-proof adhesive strip it 's intended help little boys avoid touching germy toilet seat providing sanitary grab-handle lifting lowering seat but shandle turned perfect solution us problem using handle-less babybjorn toilet trainer seat we stuck shandle side toilet seat ( around place daughter would grab onto toilet seat ) , voila ! she two , secure handles hold onto anchor used toilet trainer seat it n't hurt shandle comes variety kid-friendly designs dinosaurs , martians robots , makes attractive toddlers ( it also comes elegant fashion prints plain white , prefer bathrooms adult look ) our daughter n't yet fully potty-trained , 's comfortable enough pee toilet using babybjorn potty seat , looks forward using `` big potty '' ( so much 's pretty much lost interest stand-alone `` baby '' potty ! ) if 've holding getting babybjorn potty seat n't handles , please google `` shandle '' consider giving product try it perfect solution us grade : a- ( 1 star deducted babybjorn toilet trainer n't built-in handles ) 
+1	i started son sit potty chair turned 14 months actually prefers sitting potty chair low ground this great less clean ! would highly recommend ! 
+1	this seat worked well 25-month-old boy very easy use clean , also easy remove replace allow adults use toilet one caution : splash guard front not always catch everything , especially son not sitting centered aligned , moves around you 'll need watch , 'll likely little spillage time time perhaps next version offer expanded splashguard i still think seat much worth buying

+1	this headrest perfect since day one daughter comfy using when teeny tiny insert kept head flopping forward now bigger use without insert 's still happy at 4 months wonderful head control , i would n't put carseat without i tried head rest came graco car seat terrible it sort lets head roll carry house car for small baby i would n't even think using flimsy headrest give seat 
-1	i returned headrest i received baby shower i found items i needed use ( carseat , stroller , swing , etc ) , came headrest also , parents know , i carseat checked sheriff department 's trained carseat safety deputy , i told not use one carseat unless seat comes one made specially fit seat using one seat n't made cause child fit improperly seat , putting greater risk injury the product may fine one , i found & quot ; extra & quot ; one unnecessary 
-1	i n't really know thing works not 8 mo old refuses anything keep mind puts anything & everything mouth , eat food i try feed & currently teething it seems like great idea short transition period mush & solids this particular one appealed 's not dyed & 's made usa as whether not works ? i never know !

+1	this the best little baby gadget yet the first time i saw i thought , `` what think next '' 2 year old nearly 1 year old putting everything mouths indispensable part home it 's great teething stuff cold fruit baby love sucking away getting juice grapes , pineapple , watermelon , even strawberries ! it 's great regular feeding , since place larger pieces food inside give child taste things meat , fresh brocolli , etc the easy clean mesh bag get stained pretty quickly , i tried boil mine clean gentle soap water , two weeks steady use , carrots bananas stained bag permanently the refill package costs nearly much unit , 's worth total investment peace mind baby never choke anything eat feeder i suggest bringing extra along diaper bag -- 's great thing trips 
-1	i bought daughter 6 months old help learn chew it flimsy floppy food she played ( flipping around ) thinking toy she teething also i thought would definitely go mouth often , enjoyed throwing around instead 
+1	we started using feeder son 3 months old he loved flavor melon , uncomfortable letting bite piece melon fear might choke the baby feeder perfect answer you cut anything place feeder bag we even put lightly frozen grapes son teething we used mostly fruit , especially melon , grapes , pears , strawberries i admit messy use feeder , totally worth us give son chance learn love fresh fruits enjoy ! ! ! !

+1	i love idea son he first local gorn apple 5 months old thanks product he gnawed thing death we keep one home oone diaper bag got it easy clean one less thing worry of course supervision still required makes feel safer knowing baby eating healthy food staying safe choking 
-1	it okay lasted mesh started unraveling seams i like concept practical use , 7 5 month old n't thrilled using the handle bit heavy i wondered could n't make little lighter hold my baby ends holding onto mesh part b/c handle heavy eating get really messy 's going happen time babies try feed in comparison munchkin feeder i bought , nice handle screw munchkin feeder much durable mesh easier clean 
-1	the idea behind bags great - pump straight bag store the execution , however , lousy using twisties seal bags cumbersome annoying i prefer lansinoh bags double seal even though ca n't pump straight , sealing quick easy 
-1	i think i 've tried every bag i found disappointed these worst ! ! my daughter born prematurely never really got hang breastfeeding i wanted recieve benefits breastmilk i pumped i pumped everday since day born btwn 5 8 times day i went alot bags ( i use bottles ) pain they small , thin , punctured easily , twist ties ( although pumping directly bag great concept ) pain butt i love medela 's pumps ( i pump style advanced , seperate manual pump , used lactina hospital pump 3 months ) , i like storage bottles , i even like nipple cream , bags need work put 
-1	i not impressed storage bags i prefer use brands offer ziplock type closure this brand harder close , time consuming wasteful ( due spilling ) 
+1	if i freeze breastmilk , great i n't put lot plastic containers freezer ( could use feed baby instead ) they easy dispose outdated ( place label date ) i usually put 3 freezer bag double layer protection leaks freezer burn none ever leaked they thaw easier faster hard plastic glass containers , very convenient 
-1	if looking make mess , lose milk get frustrated , bags first , bags stand inconveniant carry little cup around help fill bag you string twist-tie bag also supposed tear little tab bottom bag get milk it 's not easy the first time i i lost whole bunch milk your better untwisting tie pouring the worst thing bag leaked times caregiver warming milk this never happened bags market my favorite lansinoh another bag thing medela bags expensive others pass try others 
-1	these bags leave lot desired they n't stand set cup milk they n't lie flat , ca n't freeze nice flat layer stack freezer the twist-tie top causes bags freeze lot folds ridges neck - made impossible open frozen bag add milk later and i 've never able tear open little tab bottom get milk - i snip edge scissors , i 'm sure defeats purpose nice , sterile inside all , i 'm really disappointed bags , positive side i n't burst freezer yet 
+1	there seem many negative reviews bags , i serious complaints i stored milk nearly 50 times using medela bags completely satisfied they sturdy hold well reheated however , i dislike fact way closed insert little trash bag tie two pre-cut holes fold twist together tight i store milk tupperware enclose large freezer ziplocks not problem milk corrupted the way close annoying n't freeze flat i store 3 bags milk per container- thus taking tons space freezer when i heat pot hot water i never double bag worry leaks matters i recommend bags continue use remainder time breast feeding 
-1	i purchased bags i returned work began pumping often what waste ! ! the twist tie design clumsy ineffective you never tie tight enough spills frequent in additon , cost ridiculous the gerber bags zip lock design much economical leak proof they found retail stores including target walmart these bags not measure medela name consider new design returning work continuing nurse baby hard enough without hassle bags 
+1	i britax chaperone infant carseat base excellent lock feature built however i could not get tight would move less inch after easily installing mighty tite , 's like base part car it n't move i not particularly strong large person breeze install i highly recommend product 
+1	the mighty-tite simple ratchet device , like see come-along truck tie very simple operate , takes getting used certain seatbelts on old center seatbelts ( shoulder harness ) breeze i put main belt & quot ; extra & quot ; strap pull tighten ratchet , crank puppy right solid house , putting & quot ; extra tail & quot ; keeps loosening plus side : man , thing tough and simple operate minus side : car seats n't enough room base thing also , new shoulder harnesses really torque seat sideways , thing makes worse i n't like using shoulder harness belt unless 's dead center car , extra torque tends make seat crooked finally , getting release kind pain you crank ratchet partial turn , hold yellow lever , pop button holding does n't always work first try now , ratchet not supposed open easily , 's big deal , takes work getting used perhaps need development release 
-1	do n't buy it 's not safe , cut seatbelt , kill child you need get good install without dangerous product 
+1	i big guy , even i pushed base graco seat , i could not get seat installed tight enough a couple clicks mighty-tite i needed fix ! this device excellent , i ca n't possibly imagine anyone breaking like reported , device weighs lot ( good thing ) feels extremely sturdy 
+1	we sheets great specially nephew they seem `` thin '' actually not thin washed many times baby puke sheets saved travel yard evil smell vomit ! put light weight blanket ( top sheet ) newborn/1month old sheets kept play yard clean ! ! love buy baby # 2 comes ! also yellow one green one they get used daily washed daily ( puke happens ) love easy easy ! 
-1	while looks like would great color , 's poorly made ( thread count must super low ) comes drier , `` balls '' collected also makes sheet not-so-soft go white ! i couple white pack 'n play sheets holding much better ! ! 
+1	i bought item ( different color ) two years ago son it not waterproof- sheet ? ! i recommend purchasing 27 '' size bru especially baby brand waterproof pad go sheet ( just like would buy waterproof cover crib mattress ! ) the sheet hold pad place fit perfectly top pad mattress this sheet durable launders easily i pleased product , i would purchase ! in fact , i ! i expecting twins , i purchased another sheet color also two smaller size two graco travel lite cribs/pnp's good job , graco coming yet another great product ! 
+1	i really like sheet it matches colors pack 'n ' play really well i kolcraft fits perfect it spit million times washed million it n't faded durable i would definitely recommend sheet ! 
+1	i also almost n't buy sheets reviews site , i could n't find another brand either , i picked two navy the sheets bit thin side ( thinnest sheets ) , since son sleeping bassinet room since day one , sheets 's ever slept they okay sheets holding well , even numerous washings oh , n't elasticized , tricky get bassinet , i worries come ( n't used play yard feature yet ) by way , 've using hot colorado summer ; winter i would definitly looking something softer cozier 
-1	bought hundred dollar pack play only option sheet ca n't make cheap one higher end sheet n't mind spending money better quality ? ? also , keep mind wash loads i bought navy realized everything else i baby pastels sheet washed seperately rest baby 's laundry would better choose lighter color could go load rest baby 's laundry 
-1	we saratoga p & amp ; p i 've disappointed sheet bought it 's bad n't used yet the material rough sheet n't fit well mattress bassinet position 
+1	we graco clarion pack n play sheet fits perfectly ca n't understand many negative reviews fit wear sheet it fits model perfectly withstood many washings well it thin , n't found problem 
-1	i regret not following advice majority reviewers one these really terrible sheets i graco cubby parade pack n play figured sheets would good since 're manufactured company boy i wrong they n't fit pad well regardless 's laying flat playpen 's set bassinet since bassinet 3/4 pad folds sheet n't stay put well they also cheaply made thin n't even word it 's upsetting babies r us carries brand i 'm going return rest store credit try find suitable replacement elsewhere as i currently using bassinet w/o sheet the pad wipes well 'm going daughter long time i use waterproof pad since 's always wrapped blanket n't mind going w/o sheet 
-1	these sheets not good i big fan graco products , not ! they thin , not soft i ended making sheets get piece flannel hem make corners , n't need elastic since mattress bending points plus , lot cheaper ! 
+1	o k , yes thin , not softest , job to add comfort i waterproof pad i think must playards anyways not easy clean matress pad come with i problems bleeding , i wash often held fine 
+1	they absorb well however , wear padded bra order seams pads not show and/or look pointy 
-1	i bought washable box said 100 % cotton however , prepping first use , ruined expensive rowenta iron why , ask ? why would cotton setting not work cotton breast pad ? because brainiacs made decided use sort nylon-based serger thread edging ! i started iron first one , iron began sticking pad i peeled iron , , perfect circle , little melted remnant marks thread it not even polyester thread , tolerates very high heat ( i e , cotton ) setting iron i incredibly disappointed i really wanted use cotton so , drawing board , i sew and case wondering i would iron , come wash wrinkly ( whether air dry put dryer ; i washed twice prepping drying methods ) one girlfriends said tried noticeable shirt wrinkling , thus , plan iron smooth wash if n't mind wrinkles , planning using padded nursing bra , i suppose would work but like , prefer padding bra , i would give pass 
+1	ultimately , nothing works better disposables , best reuseables i 've purchased i still leak time time i use house they also great comfort

-1	i liked product 's good rubbery material chew , fit sides crib front bar much wider i actually gotten & put daughter crib , months , almost looked kind liquidy underneath i went remove , removed wood varnish well , i left look better my daughter actually never bite crib railings son ( 3yrs later ) prefers chewing front bar best , course at least side bars fit not used 's converted full size bed , still teeth marks bed footer oh well , 's kind cute i plan use one wood color markers cover teeth marks really bothers 
-1	i like idea reality n't work us we would order 3 sets cover 4 sides crib gets pricey the length ( top bottom ) not enough crib either - rails like 2 3 inches so get bottom chompers underneath still go town wood and course pulls easily throws floor ( 11 months ) i 'm going order cloth ones safely tied on-not interested diy project comes ties cribs 
+1	skip alllllllll gummy crib rail protectors get they go zero headache stay note , need 2 sets cover sets rails but end cheaper far effective others , , peel , curl even bitten apart yes little fellow managed , even though n't possible thoroughly pleased recommending friends teething babies

-1	i wish i read reviews purchasing product i bought crib rail protectors twin boys figured remove within days 9 months old so not i waste money purchasing , cribs also bunch teeth marks exactly i trying avoid what waste ! 
+1	i n't agree dimensions listed amazon 's description it come 4 pieces 12 inches long cover one side crib however , i n't know 1 5 x 5 part i measured ones i inside plastic measures 3/4 inch outside around inch the plastic fairly flexible i aspen 4-in-1 crib fits rails fine my 11 month olds not pulled yet ; ) there another listing product , http : //www amazon com/prince-lionheart-crib-rail-teether/dp/b001jbalrq/ref=pd_sbs_ba_5 , might able get idea size/shape crib rail expects i covered one side crib first , seems work i went ( local store ) bought another pair cover side crib i recommend product , however , need measure consider crib rails - need skinny side update : after several months use , i noticed varnish cribs come crib stuck inside teething rails it top crib rail not entire crib rail i hardly noticed i looked harder i still like product , however , i 'm disappointed ruined wood my cribs cheap anyway , still , i take good care stuff i n't know someone put furniture polish crib rail make ( i n't ) i thought important wanted make sure know 
+1	if 2-prong plugs work perfectly if 3-prong plugs plugs adapters , prepared rearrange electronics wo n't fit product i n't found anything better though 
+1	other users lamented size product , really needs large order fit power strip plugs it gives peace mind 
+1	this power cord protector seems working fine far my baby n't one pry little fingers hole top n't issue us it comes outlet plugs , handy empty ones i n't find pieces hook together difficult line many people commented difficult i actually opened closed multiple times test no problem it takes minor concentration line pieces and actually white , not yellow appears photo 
+1	this job quite nicely , particularly price if little one really persistent , he/she could probably dig fingers opening , i plug openings i n't anything plugged caps include it n't easy unlatch , latch well my complaint i unlatch plug something new , i ca n't fault product-that baby proofing goes sometimes 
+1	holds power strip plugs okay , toddler still get fingers cracks cords come crack front piece plastic longer back piece mine also white color , not cream like appears picture 
-1	i would n't call much safety product the plastic flimsy locking tabs n't hard open i would expect better quality product something marketed `` safety '' item it 's fine deterrent , nothing i would waste money 
+1	daughter saw , wanted play she gave shortly thereafter could n't get highly recommended 
+1	this must parents ! what baby n't head straight power strip ? it easy use , plesant eyes ( white , not white like photo ) impossible babies open ! 
-1	the opening narrow accommodate iphone/ipod/macbook adapters if cover taller , would n't issue whole adapter could fit inside , 's not it 's short , even smallest apple adapters so i return anyway , i 'd kept , i would wanted use power strip i never need add/remove plugs -- tabs open cover serious pain ironically would easier open hands smaller 
+1	we active 8 month old girl , decided buy 3 cover connectors , was easy put covers perfectly makes power strip safe would highly recommend product 
+1	this giant pain apply hard open -- makes great baby proofing product , not user friendly make sure whatever plugged strip going stay long time n't something needs unplugged often the bottom portion opens easier top , also 
+1	i really like product hid plugs kept son unplugging/plugging electronics it hard however open , i guess 's point 
-1	this supposed keep kids safe my 18mth old figured open matter days 
+1	these worked well us we power strips couple different sizes house , fits it large enough cover bulky plugs plugged strips well i surprised read another reviewer found small i think cover work single-wide power strips ; probably would n't work powerstrip two rows outlets i found relatively easy open close i n't think baby daughter able open , wo n't able reach fingers shock i least five 
-1	this item useless it not keep fingers also n't fit larger plugs i not recommend anyone 
+1	i bought white cover ( model 40896 , upc 3676840896 , code label x0000dm4bb ) andsafety 1st power strip coverto compare two unlike item , cover not expandable its dimensions fixed 14 '' length , 2-3/4 '' wide , 3-1/4 '' high ( except 4 '' power strip cord end 1-3/4 '' high ) the slot cords equipment come 1/2 '' wide 7-5/8 '' long when closed , hole power strip cord 1-1/8 '' 1-1/2 '' there holes wall mounting , four outlet covers , two plastic cable ties , ten cord identifier stickers provided to open 4 '' cover power strip cord end , pull single tab ; seems rather easy child disengage , means he/she might access outlet nearest power strip cord end to open main cover , pry open three tabs , open unit like clamshell the plastic softer probably resistant breakage compared safety 1st model i like fact simply open 4 '' cover flick power strip switch it narrower shorter safety 1st model 3/4 '' either direction , may prevent using wider strips transformers 1-1/2 '' high it buy amazon com ! ( btw , amazon photo , interior actually white , i n't know produced egg-yolk-yellow color inside ) 
+1	i think great outlet strip cover i almost wish i i kids conceals nicely makes strip look much tidy it 's somewhat hard snap unsnap together but 's point , right ? i would recommend anyone looking either conceal outlet strips babyproof home 
-1	needed n't work plug 's outlets cover would n't fit 
+1	this item works great us ! again 15 month old lost interest even trying mess 
+1	it 's not flimsy maybe carpeting apartment stabalizes , 's perfect i also think 's pretty - brightened room i love makes want decorate room baby perfect height well plenty storage room i wish pad furnished bit thicker softer 's sufficient i like 's covered smooth vinyl clean easily great table great price ! 
+1	i bought changing table used baby store i recieved crib hand even used changing table great there problems it 's sturdy durable price i shelves loaded alot things problems the shelves made type posterboard wood sturdy the pad came thin cheap i purchased better one but changing table definitely worth moderate price 
+1	i going get `` spindle '' changing table pottery barn kids found one , 1/3rd price this one even better b/c rail goes around actual changing area recommend contoured changing pad comfy cover attached crib mobile table keep katie happy diaper time changing table looks good room , also bought jenny lind crib get baskets pbk store stuff neatly shelves the complaint shelves basically hard cardboard , dont let discourage b/c really sturdy mentioned 've got baskets shelves really dont notice 
+1	i n't know everyone else , i 've problems falling apart it not difficult assemble need two sets hands i store diaper-changing items top shelf baskets , diaper bags go bottom shelf the complaint i would changing pad yellowing strange spots ( nothing used ) 
+1	i hesitant register covers negative reviews i read however , son 3 months old love covers use ! some common complaints i read mention shrinking , poor fabric quality , staining easily ; experience quite different : -shrinking minimal ( i generally wash hot water i 'm getting poopy , ) -any shrinking occur not prevent cover fitting , makes snug ( i like ) -stains come easily dreft stain remover shout ( neither alters cover coloring either ) -of four covers , two loose threads excessive washing ( still great shape-i consider fabric quality excellent , especially considering amount washings go first weeks ! ) -one thing consider : colors online different person i found pictures online show darker , richer colors i 2 blue covers one yellow white the blue yellow much , much lighter person ( appear pastel ) ; i find appealing ! like i mentioned , i four covers they fantastic i recommend everyone buy one though , definitely get dirty quickly -- i think i changed mine every day first 2-3 weeks son home ! 
-1	this item serviceable probably something could buy use basically get ruined without stressing the wendy bellisimo changing pad covers $ 2 much better quality fabric the terry used cheap scratchy , like old towel i using not fussed long last happens , i wo n't buying though carter 's also makes lap pads great use changing pad you n't strictly speaking need cover , 's easier n't use one i never used covers dd never problem 
+1	do exact intended they 've never ripped us get warm quicker ( breastmilk ) typical plastic bottles it easier cleanup using drop-ins thus worth slight extra cost us 
+1	i love bottles liners ! they get rid half washing since i n't wash bottles they 're lifesaver 
+1	have n't used yet i n't baby looking forward ! ! ! i buy cheaper somewhere else still good product seems like ! ! 
+1	you remove air liner minimizes ingestion air initially hesitant/worried use system since solely breastfeed 5 months the baby issues liner/bottle system we use conjunction medela breast pump works great , met expectations 
+1	love liners using many years kids never problem 
-1	i n't get purpose since air goes right back feeding ( got special playtex nipples bottles ) also , store brand ones thing half price walmart ones not soft , thing still 
+1	these drop-ins okay - not improvement ordinary bottle yes , i simply throw liners away using , since i still wash bottle 's nipple , system not save time i use liners conjunction bottle warmer n't melt , good i bought playtex drop-in system try reduce amount ( frequency quantity ) baby spits however , amount spit-up - not better , also not worse 
+1	i big proponent playtex bottle liner drop-ins cleaning bottles becomes limited cleaning nipples -- far less difficult task they 're easy effective 
+1	we twins purchasing products , investing money things would make lives simpler these drop-ins work really well bottles the bag collapses consume contents , supposedly improves problems gas i 'm not sure system accomplishes better others because bag thin , also takes lot less time warm bottles consideration the real savings manpower time necessary cleaning i 4 bottles per baby , replace liner nipple necessary , wash everything day these n't come cheap i n't think cost savings associated versus buying boat load bottles 
+1	could n't find stores around area but i 've used 're great it 's convenient minimizes need lot bottles best part 're disposables i never problems drop-in liners although i read another review 's another liner used drop-in nurser bottles , good not effective , cheaper count regardless , stamp approval i would recommend new parents 
+1	i love liners they quick easy way ensure sterile container milk i never problem leaking except one time i squeezing air , squeezed little hard pop ! ! , breastmilk everywhere i learned lesson- squeeze gently , my complaints : 1 they bit pricey plastic bags convenience factor makes , imho 2 the amount markings bags bit hard read n't really line markings nurser shells , way i tell much lo taken pour measure leftover milk otherwise , great product ! !

+1	love i use i pump bottle travel they handy , easy use i love use toss right trash good price amount 
+1	some people say drop-ins not keep good seal , i found individuals trying push air nipple pressure broke seal if want less air press air putting ring pressing air unnecessary the liner job without pressing air the point collapsible liner not let air baby eats , fantastic job if would rather not buy replacement liners , playtex ventaire takes nipples job vent bottom , keeping seal pressure milk , allowing air bottom replace milk baby eats these n't leak long bottom ring screwed properly i loved i n't buy replacements job ! 
+1	i love bottles ! i breastfeed son takes bottles easily i 'm not around they easy convenient ! i 'm not sure would mixing formula , seems may not easy seeing exact measurements rather difficult i recommend everyone ! no problems excess gas know getting fresh , clean liner everytime ! love love love !

+1	i n't much time go shopping things need new baby the playtex bottles easy since 's real cleaning everyday - liners pop ! the price good walmart comes right door without walmart craziness : ) would recommend sure ! no problems leaking anything 
+1	baby breastfed these work well childcare providers transfer warmed milk into great price easy use shipped fast ! 
-1	i measured 8 ounces measuring cup , poured liner , little 8 ounces mark liner i tried different measuring cup received result you not put liner bottle first fill , measurements bottle not match measurements liners , my husband always hard time filling liners hard hold add water since expand also , numbers liner hard read 
+1	i love playtex drop system - might cost little 's worth ease bottle prep knowing bottles clean sanitary every time ! these n't tear warm easily cup hot water 
+1	i go quickly , i get couple boxes time worth price ; price better price store 
+1	very easy use , combined almost nothing clean the small cost reusable liners far overshadowed convenience

-1	i wasted much milk using drop-ins i bought box 4 ounce box 8 ounce liners , boxes multiple liners holes milk ended counter any pumping mother knows perfectly reasonable cry spilled breast milk , believe , i 've done many times i 've tried good pouring little bit milk hole , i 'll waste little bit but , come , i 'm sleep deprived , stressed sometimes i forget , i end 6 ounces milk kitchen counter , i n't check like product i 've paid no good out box 100 liners , i would say 1/4-1/3 holes leak that 's quite lot ; 're not talking one two unfortunately , i 've invested playtex bottles playtex nipples , i spend even money buying whole new bottle feeding system i not afford spill breast milk every fourth time i go fill bottle i 'm extremely disappointed wasted much money system much time pumping milk pour kitchen counter i would not recommend 
+1	so easy use not much clean-up afterward just pop liner bottle , add water powdered formula , shake good go 
+1	i using 5 months , since daughter born perfect i not problems much safer sterile plastic bottle worth extra cost continue buy i think thing could come close good glass bottles 
+1	used throughout bottle stage 19-month old playtex bottles ones used drop liners saved us time dishes worth extra expense

+1	this great ! i used boil water first child 's bottles sterilized then i got 2nd 3rd children i read reviews 's much easier pop dishwasher but us n't run dishwashers daily ( maybe 's not full load yet ) this sterilizer takes 7 oz water takes 4 minutes microwave bottles , nipples , pacifiers , breast pump , etc sterilized you ca n't beat 7 ounces water 4 minutes time you ca n't always wait dishwasher , take 30 minutes , plus water used so , i think sterilizer great convenient

+1	we love sterilizer it quick , easy use , fits brands well we would n't want sterilize way !

+1	i not originally sign item ; given along box 6 4-oz avent bottles baby shower i really like product ; according sterilizer 's instructions regarding microwave wattage , takes 2 minutes sterilize 2 minutes cool i 've never issues getting burned anything melting and takes 7 oz water ( i use filtered water instead tap water ) i recycle every 2-3 uses avoid wasting water ( beyond water level decreases 's best measure make sure 's still 7 oz ) however , i gassy baby wanted see i could switch born free bottles since several friends raved my 1 month old daughter drinking 4 oz , i bought 9 oz born free bottles unfortunately not fit sterilizer she seems growing stage fussy night long due gas i guess i 'll stick avent brand bottles instead buying new sterilizer accommodate using different brand bottles

+1	we started i call newborn tub switched 3 months we could used whole time 'd ! it large fits perfectly existing tub we used kitchen island counter-top 6 months son really sitting unassisted unless sink right next large enough counter space bail tub bit unless really strong one side sloped reclining makes hair washing breeze older baby stay reclined ! my son longer ! the opposite side little deeper older babies there drain plug built n't leaked yet ! just press setting tub sure the stopper drain plug tends flop back making draining tub take little longer we squish one squirt toys walls recline side tub tuck stopper underneath 
+1	this best baby bath tub it large , taking good amount space , hung wall ( hole top rim tub use ) 's simple take set give baby bath we 've used two homes 've lived , 's worked great i used kitchen counter small condo ( n't much space anywhere else ) i used large bathroom counter townhouse i tried sponge shape first son regular bathtub really hurt back ( n't like lying water ) this keeps baby 's head elevated even ca n't support ; baby sit later end win win !

+1	this life saver ! best bath tub side lightweight enough room lo 8 months old play 
-1	this only bathtub i purchased , based stellar reviews , boy i disappointed ! ! my baby 6 pounds full-term , tub huge ! ! even so-called supports tub , still slid place , i still lean side tub hold carefully ! she hated i , day ( 18 months later ! ) hates tub 're still sink-side sponge baths ! ! if i , i 'd get one smaller tubs sling-type support ! if your baby is a preemie or is just on the smaller side , do not buy this tub - it is just way too huge and really has no supports ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! update : i recently purchased the munchkin ducky tub for $ 15 , and i was able to get her to climb into the tub and even start playing within the first 5-10 minutes of her laying eyes on it ! ! it 's considerably smaller , walls go straight ( versus slanted , like primo ) way around , i think makes feel much secure safe ! ! should 've gone beginning 
+1	after twins got big baths sink still small sit tub , loss all tubs saw meant one kid hoping able give baths time i finally saw eurobath decided try it worked fantastically ! one baby recline partially sat , could finally give baths time we 've using several months problems whatsoever our kids love ! 
+1	i surprised large tub i received literally , 3 year old take bath he loves , calls `` boat '' it really sturdy positions infant toddler , really last long time if not looking something large , not tub : - ) if smaller infant ( i always ) , i would think adding sponge insert help allow even smallest baby fit we love ! 
+1	ok , tub need , folks we started using soon son 's cord stump fell alex *hated* sponge baths , loves primo tub the reclining position pretty darn safe , gives baby lot support wash , godsend alex kicks feet water , i n't worry held raised center bumper n't slip far water the depth perfect , - baby n't get chilled i agree reviewers drain small product size , really , 's not hard upend tub dump bath water baby 's i also like indentions hold soap bath products keeping close reach handy the real negative size primo - gets unwieldy take tub company comes , otherwise leave tub i look forward using many years ! 
+1	this bathtub excellent use birth toddlerhood i started using son 's first bath great i put towel underneath safe secure now 's 20 months , still use , 's still comfortable sure , could probably use bathtub , use much less water i feel 's much safer if accidentally slips backwards , sloping backrest catches without injury it 's nice big - , plus i think 'll continue fit comfortably least another year however , really tiny bathroom shared multiple people , could drawback how many baby products use , basically every day , first 3 years baby 's life ? ! not many considering fact , 's $ 25 well spent also , might nice know : stopper/gasket breaks , company send replacement free charge given fact , bathtub could last generations ! ; ) 
+1	we call tub `` moby dick '' house account 's size , great tub 16 mo old he really not slip tub ample room play splash i use baby side shampoo hair all , great tub !

+1	we love tub daughter ! i read reviews glad recieved gift the tub great since newborn , weighed 7 lbs 11 oz she fits great contoured area water level sufficient keep warm happy bathtime we originally bought one sponge teddy bear pads put inside tub , found unecessary uncomfortable water much instead make plastic lays little comfier put hand towel lay we extremely happy tub would rated five stars , except fact huge it hard find anywhere store monstrous tub bath damp that said , fact big allows two parents enjoy giving bath together little one , allows deepness water tradeoff 'll decide

+1	older friends tell we given diaper genie shower gift proved invaluable baby 's nursery upstairs , bought second one downstairs changing table ( wrapping diaper plastic bag throwing garbage - yuck ! ) keep instructions get hang loading genie - genie comes loaded first roll plastic , trouble figuring load next roll n't practice first roll misplaced instructions it easy load not easy figure loads n't paying attention sleep-deprived 
+1	it works great ! no icky smells easy empty i put dryer sheet bottom like regular garbage it makes smell nice just read instructions first , saves frustration later ! ; c ) 
+1	for us life saver ! ! it really helpfull i even bought another one mother 's house im agree lot nice stuff reviews im not going repeat , i say something many times gets full it 's not true gets full everyday it would get full put diapers open what fold diaper together wipes use , would see difference i use change every 2 days , it gets full every 4 days the refills not expensive , could always get free refills babies r us , buying 2 3 together i use one refill every 3 weeks i n't try one market , perfect , i could say best option ! ! ! 
-1	be wary diaper pail requires instructions demo next-door-neighbor order use ! after i figured i found pain fool also refills expensive n't hold enough diapers imo it n't lock odors either it may first week two , 3 1/2 months smells bad i guess diapers gotten stinkier what i say ? the thing drives nuts first diapers i put refill change never go correctly no matter many times i twist first diaper , second one always pushes right first twist ends hanging bottom - un-sausage-linked the positive thing i say cut links loose easy dispose outside garbage you may want save money one go something less fru-fru 
+1	this product worthwhile , going changing diapers constantly , need throw away sort sanitary convenient manner when baby starts eating solids , quite different aroma coming diapers ! this device basically garbage , helps keep nursery getting stinky the thing , holds many diapers , make nursery smell `` baby powder-y '' so keep room well ventilated the diaper genie easy use , refills last long time if happen live building , garbage shoot floor , n't need just put day 's worth diapers plastic bag , shoot 
-1	i would rather throw diapers kitchen trash it 's lot faster easier trying mess genie i would recommend trying different brand 
+1	oh diapers not really stinky issue baby young breastfeed but wait introduce solids phew ! ! ! i suggest get one right bat go straight using green liners toddler diapers they thicker hold stench bay way better wimpy blue liners just remember empty sucker every day even diaper genie abandon smell genie 
-1	i got gift loved first six months then i discovered waste money once solid foods introduced son 's diet , n't even come close holding stench i even used different types refills made ie infant , original toddler still n't trick i even put air fresheners near eventually i gave took dirty diapers straight garage used pee diapers still hassle remove `` diaper weenie '' i use normal trash much less hassle results 
+1	i love product ! ! it makes huge difference changing room smells i seen negative reviews product , i would guess n't mastered use it little tricky it would nice held diapers , cutting changing refills little tricky , i love the sausage idea great contains smell open put another diaper my 5 mo old laughs everytime sees father change he loves go poo-poo sausages talented making lol ( daddies weird ) when get one make sure read directions twice 
-1	the diaper genie job keeping odors away , otherwise real pain ! if shove diaper accidentally miss clips reach pull messy diaper wipes ! ick particularly icky 2 am and contrary one poster says , monkey definitely could n't operate thing the refill directions lousy it took us half hour figure install refill , 're college-educated professionals ( dad , retired mechanical engineer , could n't even figure ! ) it 's hard get refill , even figure part 's ommitted instructions when 're busy newborn , last thing time energy deal challenge like ! and obvious dial top cut liner instead sealing liner next use ? yes , realize 's reading directions but tell anyone helping care baby not turn noticeable dial n't think will if decide purchase product , n't turn liner multiple times use directions suggest the reason say 'll run liner faster buy refills one two turns sufficient get diaper lined genie properly i wish i taken better look competing products i realize 's real reason companies decided come models the diaper genie major flaws 
-1	it big waste of money the diaper genie good baby newborn ( 1-3 months ) after 4 months doo doo really stinks smell come little bit even change every day the inside gets horrible smell like something died it hard replace refill even though discontinued selling original still sell refills original right next wide refills so baby shower i recieved original re-fill wide genie and i not notice untill i tried replace i already opened origianl refill broke darn thing so right garbage money drain 
+1	the diaper genie sooo easy use always coupons refills i love it even husband use lolol u pop diaper til u feel grabber thingys close twist lid locks diaper i keep next changing table know son ca n't get wo n't smell nasty poopies 
-1	we ended giving away the stickers comes joke we went another brand ( one long piece ) worked much better since brick fireplace rounded if go one , make sure get removable caulk stickers n't work at all 
+1	a new baby reaching toddler size presents lot difficulties around house what get ? how injure ? what need protect ? hmmmmmm it 's tough question matter , 'll probably find something n't think our toddler already found tube diaper rash creme spread ( primarily face ) wood floor carpet well , 've tried common sense things for example , living room large fireplace raised brick hearth the edge , particularly corners , sharp harsh could cause good wound baby fall so bought prince lionheart cushiony fireplace guard i installed hour it 's one-size-fits-all solution i afraid fireplace big no problem it took bit cutting , ended 6 inches edge left over we n't like looks , baby 's safety greater importance the guard stuck tape 3m warnings 10 different languages not guarantee glue damage hmmmmm i expect damage guard removed it 's imperfect solution , better nothing gary peterson 
+1	just described works well , good quality needs replacing child teething i replace product 
+1	easy put only put tape top not sides n't perfect 90 angle our fireplace made stone pieces uneven sides it still stays tape top holding colors true actual look 
+1	have n't issues sticking my 13-month old tried pulling , n't succeeded not sure 's due getting product right lack interest attention or 
-1	we got becasue new house brick fireplace elevated ledge our daughter learning walk moved part baby-proofing decided needed something fireplace this option bru waste money it n't fit together right adhesive n't stick brick plus daughter seemed drawn ! it never failed wanted go right try get so took 's fine without anything in fact , 's pretty much left alone since took 
+1	worked well son began walking around 12 months would fall everything i purchased colour best matched fireplace mantel 
+1	i 2 covers love put wash least 2x week , 5 months n't even faded ( blue cream colored one ) i throw dryer regularly well problem fitting back onto changing pad - issue covers i time wait airdry , must overall 'm pleased 
-1	i two changing pad covers used year first child they mediocre i noticed material frayed around elastic months use i stitched back , looks kind cruddy material continues unravel new places i agree one comments regarding slit safety strap one not present finally , i used changing pad `` especially baby '' fit bit tight resulted pad curving bit time for dollars , i would strongly recommend looking pottery barn kids ' chamois pad covers they extrememly soft ( 'll wish sheets made stuff ! ) , safety strap slits fit changing pad perfectly 
-1	i ca n't believe much shrunk washed ! it never made changing table you would think makers would know every item going touch baby going washed therefore , material pre-shrunk marketing 
+1	we two rotate work fine us we also contoured changing pad simmons true , seem little small straight dryer ( cover stretches straight across top pad ) , one changing baby 's weight shapes right place that 's really never bothered and considering often washed , really holding well my complaint ( i n't give five stars ) could little softer 
-1	these changing pad covers poor quality not held well washings in addition , covers not fit changing pad well pull sides unfortunatly not seem choices i still use covers , i also lay waterproof multi-use pad top this way i change multi-use pad i n't wash changing pad cover often 
+1	this changing pad cover works great especially baby contour changing pad i one white one green ( green matches malawi bedding really well ) i washed dried many times all stains came stayed soft n't shrink much i stretch bit get , place fit perfectly the straps pad i attached bottom i n't need cut holes cover order able use straps i also use small changing pads i n't change wash cover often i like i put baby something soft warm instead cold plastic pad i definitely recommend getting 
+1	this terry cloth cover lifesaver it covers cold vynil changing pad it cover big fat rips vynil changing pads , would never know ripped it caught numerous undiapered poops pees went right wash without wipe thing that favorite quality it i two one wash changing pad the beef i first wash , one terry covers ripped seam thats ok though , fixed quickly stitches no matter great buy 
+1	these covers comfy fit pretty decent ( opinion ) however , i n't really use much i found pretty early 's easier change son uncovered changing pad constantly spitting , urinating pooping pad i wash covers every day ! now i bring visitors ( like fine linens , ha ha ! ) 
+1	we got gift baby shower two years ago i glad this almost must babies the range fantastic i outside watching two year old baby sleeps i know i able hear not range great also picks smallest sounds , i hear baby rolling crib as added bonus , i not found battery eater in opinion moniter not important thing baby however , one useful things want measure freedom baby napping child sleeps clear across house sleep

-1	we 've three two total junk box one worked well the first one got n't work it totally useless the static loud could barely make noises babies room but , sent back exchanged new one the new worked great so , ordered another one kid 's room this 3rd one total junk so , 2 3 junk but , one work , really like for , explains mixed reviews product poor quality control as far one work , details i liked it we 've tried monitors this one least static for us , static important issue we hate we use baby monitors primarily night , hear kids wake middle night if monitors lot static keeps us getting sleep the next important issue unnecessary beeping some monitors 've used periodically loose signal baby 's room , automatically reconnects seconds each time loose signal beep loudly let us know this always wakes us this happen dozen times night no good this monitor not beep looses signal , maybe never looses signal either way 're sleeping much better 
+1	the unit 4 feet away crib every sound baby makes clearly heard it even picks sound a/c unit i remain sitting chair 's 12 feet away unit , nursing baby ask sons living room , parent unit located , bring glass water i love parent unit used without batteries 
+1	maybe best $ deal i found far i would not one this one clear loud i would buy another day 
+1	we actually gotten monitor free promotional offer babies r us i skeptical first free , got home worked great ! a little bit static , nothing compared monitor we expensive montior tons static threw right back closet got one ! 
+1	finally had our baby and got to try it out the first time i hooked it up was when i recieved it , i did hear the neighbors monitor a little but almost all baby monitors will have that prob unless you want to spend alot of $ but this has 2 channels to choose from so just switch it that simple i have had it on for last few days and works perfect very sensitive , and almost no hissing or buzzing at all and doesnt need to be turned up very loud just set it right next to the crib on a table very happy with it 
+1	i given gift love ! there no static i even hear baby breathing ! i recommend everyone !

+1	i among parents really upset news bpa children 's bottles -- especially i exclusively pumped milk son , meant milk not served also stored plastic bottles we switched glass shortly news broke the evenflo glass bottles certainly great buy -- price fantastic ! i n't wild rubber nipples came bottles , i pitched used nipples 'd using ( just standard-size , opposed wide , nipple fit bottles ) i also feel like glass gets `` cleaner '' plastic 's probably not true , glass n't get scratched cloudy like plastic , bottles seem pristine ! of course , best part glass bottles glass inert so pretty much zero worries anything leaching milk ( formula ) now , downside suckers heavy ! we almost never used larger bottles , filled , weighed ton and 've never smacked face bottle toddler well , let 's say ones way painful plastic ones ! and , unsurprisingly , glass break these quite solid , though , i think ever broke two -- one home ( dropped hardwood floor ) one airport ( son threw onto chair metal arm whoops ! ) since son longer drinking anything bottles except little water bedtime , 've switched bpa-free plastic , convenience ( co-sleeping family 's safety ! ) but next baby born i 'm pumping work , definitely storing milk glass evenflo bottles

+1	i purchased gate son learning crawl stuck bathroom door frame keep - wonderful ! i could bathroom watching hall i hair cleaned , without getting toilet pulling blowdrier he learned pull gate , i feel like extremely sturdy i love guests came , bathroom door would still shut , loved easy use the pressure mounts secure gentle appartments used well this gate baby 's door frame keep 2 year old big brother nap time , still let mommy hear baby needs i love tall 35 lb 39 inch 2 year old ca n't open , anyone 6 tried home , simple effortless ! this wonderful gate , i would ( ) recommend anyone ! we used 2 years , still love ! 
+1	we 've tried least three different gates different doorways entrances , one 's far best it really hands-free open better yet , closes automatically bumping shut , unlike gates require hand *close* , argh one complaint i 've heard foot pedal breaking that n't happened us , use two , happened friends ( friends friends ) 've one several years i suspect anyone 's broke gate entrance either tightly crooked so , use tool comes box checking tightness , use level ( ing device ) get straight 
+1	this gate easy put sturdy it also convenient since levers pull push hand open it 's totaly hands free leaving carry things walk gate we thought opening might little small , 's n't seem bad 
+1	this hands-free gate works step foot paddle causes latch open you push gate open hand knee the gate fairly easy install ( necessary slim wrench included box ) requires screws glue the gate provides good protection the bars gate well-spaced even small infants n't able crawl when properly installed , provides solid protection , although ( important ! ) regularly check make sure 's securely affixed door frame also , time gate tends bend little , use little wrench-like tool adjust necessary in short , good gate keeping kids certain room but *not* designed never used guard top stairway 
+1	good gate fall hands free gate mobile home house apartment leveled perfect hand free easy install alot harder knock baby gates daughter could never knock gate matter hard tried even year half would stand lean still would n't fall round good gate

+1	we love gate , bought one block top staircase , wanted second one block living area kitchen unfortunately coverage range product limited even extensions the gate overall made solid material the kickstand takes bit pressure release , 's good , son ca n't accidentally push open gate the gate area smaller average walk , 's not bad out gates like hands free gate best it would gate purchase could bigger area 
+1	we got gate plus two extensions , one either side , almost month ago triplets turned year old we concerned first extra extensions would able support three babies sufficiently it ! the downfall , i 've seen mentioned times , available width space n't match gate says support so get running border width , add extra extension sure 's not wobbling and measuring think using gate extentions barely fit , try , likely wobbly bit just keep mind otherwise , great gate ! we added baseboards along bottom walls plus tiny toe boards pressure mounted adjusts great just take time get things even straight it n't take long set , 15-20 minutes tops it works great us since live military base housing want avoid putting holes walls fill later it 's odd first get used foot petal get used , 's lifesaver ! we clear view gate playroom love kitchen doorway needed something wider convenient smaller swing door since use kitchen the bar bottom took couple days get used ramps either side helps not tripping the gate swings either way helps ! sooo worth money since things used years ! 
+1	product delivered description easy use , install , hands free it says 's not approved use top stairs gates approved use top stairs hardware mounted ones , i put hallway right stairs works great although 's sturdy , n't rule needing hardware mounted would work stairs i 'm not sure old people 's children said open gate , mine 1 's way 's strong enough in order open gate good amount leg strength i would n't anticipate younger kids 
-1	i thought idea seemed great since hands would full baby arrived , not work us we bought use doorway , foot pedal stuck never would able close door the opening gate also narrow we returned north state industries easy close gate , love 
+1	medical bills ! previously , cheap wood , stationary gate hallway i must hefted pregnant self 10 month old gate hundred times day taking serious toll back knees after 10th time i nearly fell darn thing , i went find new gate saw one next day i picked bru ( i get extender peice ) installed it wonderful sturdy , tall , nice look opens effortlessly could n't thrilled everyone used loves fussing latches handgrips just step nudge

+1	this probably best gate i 've far i really like hands free foot peddle i 've six months n't problems 
+1	we got gate recently got 2 puppies , gated areas house n't run around house causing havoc however regular gates pain , step , hassle especially trying carry new baby so great only complaints : i wish opening larger , n't huge- fair , description give dimensions the thing taking get used , bar bottom gate- even opening , still watch step , less hassle take gates step overall , i would recommend 
+1	this great gate -- convenient , sturdy , etc we use top stairs the opening seems little narrow , overall 's not bad 
+1	i really like gate , easy install looks great i highly recommend i also metal door frames i n't know would dent wood regular door frame though i think small dent would better screw hole 
+1	i like look feel gate concept 's `` hands-free '' design opening , let 's face -- gate requires use hands open worthless mom holding baby it seems pretty solid construction , tension gate , actually holds pretty well not gate confine pets babies/toddlers/little kids , seems adult-proof , every single adult come house hesitated gate could n't figure ha ! there definitely downsides , serving us well dog baby gate close two years now pros : - hands-free opening- clean , simple , solid design- ability add extenders work great wide hallways ( i use one side gate ) - tension-mount system 's movable n't put holes walls cons : - beware painted walls recently ( recent us maybe months prior ) the rubber grip pads ripped paint right i released tension holding rods i 'm not sure paint walls cheap 's many layers paint , i ripped large chunk wall upon moving gate so yeah , patch sort defeated purpose avoiding gate required mounting hardware - pedal get `` stuck '' become temperamental i think also causes problems closing you able close easily pushing gate back , always sticks one directions requires care close properly - i n't know , almost 21 month-old managed open gate maybe 10 times she refuses tell every time i try watch try , acts helpless ca n't open so yeah , 's apparently step ahead visiting adults ca n't open thing despite fact open time time , i still like gate really important feature home even crawling walking , perfect keeping two big dogs confined one side house if i purchase replacement gate , i would n't hesitate get another one 
+1	my 22 month old open doors still ca n't open gate ! gives great piece mind i love n't need use hands open close installed without problems , adjusts fit door way house ( old house , nothing even ) grandparents love , ended buying one well

+1	we use gate block baby going kitchen but primary entrance/exit house via kitchen , needed something easy open hands full voila , hands-free gate ! it great , open close foot knee like reviews state we buy 2 extensions , one side gate cover opening kitchen they work great , problems i two complaints , not outweigh much i like gate : first , gate difficult install there one part would n't fit properly , husband bend something pliers get fit caused 10 minutes extreme aggravation , haha second , pedal noisy push ! i need try wd-40 see help , i honestly n't tried yet but still , really like gate noise problem n't change fact ! baby hangs i n't see would ever strong enough press pedal open , really need press hard ! 
-1	tl ; dr looking great gate function well 6 months , inevitably break unrepairable ways , gate ! i loved gates we bought two relatively easy install effective keeping rambunctious 2 year old kitchen hallway the foot petal requires quite bit pressure , even kept 6-yr old nephew contained pretty well : ) that said -- reliability time *horrendous* these gates come 90-day warranty , gates started breaking obviously flawed ways within 6-months the first gate stopped locking shut -- obviously problem gate supposed keep 2 year old places the problem spring-loaded plastic peg actually separate spring inside end swinging door i contacted manufacturer customer support good ! they shipped two replacement pegs i able get door working within days that said -- issue certainly happen , nothing preventing spring separating this clear design flaw weeks later second gate broke this time foot petal stopped actuating pin , door not open after taking plastic assembly foot petal , i found metal pin connects plastic petal metal arm completely broken ( two places ) after putting pieces together , issue became clear -- metal pin tapered quite substantially two places -- exactly pin broke with people putting significant force foot petal open gate -- dozens times day -- really unacceptable obvious weak point design metal pin the problem pin broken 's clearly way actually reassemble foot petal actuating arm -- even good pin there way fix broken gate upon contacting manufacturer 's customer service , confirmed way fix foot petal nothing willing address broken gate in end , regret bought gates , i rather disappointed manufacturer n't seem acknowledge design flaws gates i think also speaks volumes offer 1-2 year warranties almost baby products -- except gates makes really think 
+1	this gate really great product i love fact n't hardware mount gate ( drilling doorways required ) , 's still sturdy it incredibly easy install , safe secure my 18 month son knows gate opens , not open weight required push lever the negatives i encountered were:1 ) the first hands free gate i purchased not painted properly , i return another one 2 ) i buy 5 & quot ; gate extension gate fit doorway so , end , additional costs opening intend use gate not narrow but , 's totally worth 
-1	i needed gate top stairs , searched amazon `` baby gate top stairs '' this gate second item returned nowhere description say gate not used top stairs of course soon opened box instructions clearly say do not use at the top of stairs the gate works great upstairs hallway , 'll still need buy different gate point want baby access room

+1	i fortunate find two gates two extensions second hand baby store 20 dollars after first year newborn , i 've come need coupe gates i tried 4 similar ones quickly sent back these ones little expensive , i 've found spoiled foot opening contraption gates , i simply not live without feature another gate i need extensions , makes expensive , i purchasing two near future ! ! 
+1	our little one rolling starting crawl , bought two gates , one top walk-up stairs , one hallway they fantastic you two things open gate -- push foot pedal pushing gate forward , without hands , perfect carrying little one arms the foot pedal also requires substantial push , way baby ( pet ) would able the material sturdy , even toddler tried pull gate , would not come undone the gate door also works ways , important feature the one negative far i tell coming stairs , takes little extra coordination step foot pedal definitely recommended 
+1	i love gate would buy i like swings open ways , opens foot pedal 's hands free , incredibly sturdy though 's pressure-mounted my only disappointment gate n't fit well stairs we live small apartment wall n't jut far enough bottom step order foot pedal work instead , i mounted gate doorway baby 's nursery , working great

+1	i happy find gate works us we use bottom stairs along kidco spindle not sure options mounting round staircase baluster if similar staircase i would say product ! 
+1	i purchased two gates bottom stair cases they fairly easy install even though instructions n't clear i buy 5 5 inch extension y spindle pack fit stairs once i got together i surprised sturdy gates they seem high quality 
+1	after trying 3 different gates ( high ratings amazon ) , favorite i turned home version baby gate showroom figure one i wanted , 's take three different gates i think pretty good gates , depends situation features 're looking the key features ended making difference 1 ) width gate opening 2 ) latch mechanismkidco center gateway : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -cost $ 85 & extensions $ 24 / gate 29 5 '' tall / fits 29 25 '' 37 5 '' doorway width / 1 '' bar step / gate opening 22 '' - has widest gate opening ( space walk thru , not doorway fits ) - 22 '' ( this certainly points 6'2 '' husband pretty irritated walking thru others ) i surprised reading many reviews gates n't mention feature - this one also secure latch feature you push button lift handle lift gate little ledge open walk thru i figure absolutely hardest one little one figure out - this gate adjustable widths therefore would probably strongest door widths the gate 2 75 '' pieces ends use not optional extensions ( 2 75 '' spindles additions - 2 per box ) provide width flexibility because gates become `` weaker '' posts extended much , one seems sturdiest doorways ( ie gate says fits 37 '' door opening 36 5 '' , wo n't seem sturdy doorway 34 '' ) - it n't brand name printed anywhere ( plus book ) 's totally white - it lowest bar across floor step 1 '' high ( seems less tripping risk ) - this one highest rating consumer reports ( child safety gates 08/04 ) - unfortunately , also expensive bunch $ 85 + extensions need - i say one confusing directions , still figure ok - none took longer 10 minutes set up - it 's shortest gate i wish little taller - all , afford price one , 's definitely worth ! summer infant - sure & secure extra tall gate -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -cost $ 60 & extensions included / gate 36 '' tall / fits 28 '' -48 '' doorway width / 2 '' bar step / gate opening 19 '' - this one i wanted like i thought best deal - the gate opening 19 '' - i thought ok , hubby wanted wider - the latch mechanism really easy operate i thought kids could figure easily , gate tall , would probably hard time reaching it - it come extensions 5 '' 10 '' easily fits wider doorways - however , depending width doorway , one may may not fit well for example , i lot doorways 33 '' gate n't end fitting well gate without extensions small posts extended far n't seem stable and 5 '' extension big add ( vs kidco gate 's extensions add 2 75 '' needed ) - it 's far tallest i liked since daughter 95 % far i also like way taller gate looks - it highest bar across bottom step - 2 '' - if fits well doorway probably best value money first years - hands-free gate -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -cost $ 50 & extensions $ 15 / gate 32 '' tall / fits 29 '' -34 '' doorway width / 1 5 '' bar step / gate opening 17 '' - my gripe gate primarily gate opening 17 '' wide ! i 'm 5'8 '' i felt like i going really pay attention walking i would n't end bumping every time however - the hands-free step pedal pretty cool worked pretty easily i would n't worry little kid figuring enough weight able push open for n't cool enough overcome issue gate opening width - good height gate - it sturdy doorway - this one little ramp feature bar goes across floor helps minimize tripping factor - fits 34 '' doorways best chance needing extension - all said , really want hands free gate , width gate opening n't bug , try one all three gates seemed : - fit pretty tightly doorways adjusted properly depending walls moldings etc , might need take extra 5-10 minutes adjust get straight hanging correctly - had type post pressure-mount covered rubbery material help not slip wall - were pretty easy set up - all look quality point view - words one n't look `` cheaper '' others please remember safety , hardware mounted gates considered stable enough put top stairs , n't use think use gates house features value good luck purchase ! 
+1	this gate much better market the design allows function well gate , yet allowing foot traffic inclusion lockable door unit the gate made metal , i deducted 1 star due locking mechanism made plastic only time tell much real-world use stand another thing gate i like flexibility offered availability extensions -- possible mount gate pretty much anywhere needed overall , i happy purchase 
+1	this second kidco product i purchased let start saying products safest i every confidence security gates i installed but , first gate i purchased standard gateway uses hardware install you see review thing pertinent included limited hardware box would not work safely installing gate dry wall ( even stud ) so , instead including another set screws would 've cost $ 0 90 , kidco likes make busy parents go buy stuff themselves well , gate torturous surprise busy parents trying multitask every hour day kidco kindly includes two extensions making gate much versitile market the thing n't tell extensions held tension holds gate wall each tension screws completely separate one another ( good design allows installation uneaven surfaces ) however , mechanism holding extensions place , means parent installing gate must use two hands hold gate , make sure 4 separate extension brackets two separate support bars , 4 metal extension bars brackets slide ( none lockinto place anyway ) n't fall , trying tighten one tension screw time i not even explain two limbs not enough get job done still remain sane end process throw bone kidco ! how brackets clip screw holds brackets place n't slide i 'm trying mount gate ? something ! ? ! unfortunately , find kidco often makes best products kind thing sure cut corners little stuff would make parent 's life lot easier 
+1	i purchased product used it still easy install truly pressure mounted - not need put holes walls we installed bottom stairs , one step up pros : *this sturdy gate my twins stand first step constantly play apply weight *its fairly simple use one handed *the opening plenty wide enough walk without turn sideways ( i 'm not skinny minnie ) *this probably work i need install doorway keep toddlers room , not conflict doorknob ( guessing ) *the door open either direction ( although stairs n't matter ) cons : i 've using gate least 4 months - i ca n't think any i bought another brand gate ( tall gate ) use another entrance it getting returned 1 ) not truly pressure mounted , 2 ) not sturdy like kidco gate - i 'm spoiled ! i mention i go back get another kidco gate - i feel comfortable knowing hold two toddlers hanging i n't mar walls i recommend gate would purchase ( even new ) ( i n't use pets , would good smaller animals not jumping due height gate ) 
+1	if going invest baby carrier , invest best i use carrier time even husband started use originally said would never put baby contraption it hold baby securly comfortable wear has classy look goes wash well easy get baby

-1	this product great worked , within month using , metal part adapter broke i unable use since i used maybe 4-6 times first month - not sure metal flimsy 
+1	i sure works fine think buying if like , soon pregnant ordered absolutely everything would possibly need i pump exclusively breastfeed i realize i really n't think ever time i would need pump car ! 
+1	i chuckled first time i saw car adapter reading reviews i thought might something would really make life easier i decided purchase going road trip i glad i i going give pumping i went back work hour commute way perfect time pump least two times day without interfering workload while thought pumping driving seemed silly , i tried today completely safe inconspicuos hands-free pumping bra shirt i glad i bought even stronger charge plug adapter i recommend working mom might think giving pumping be hands free great idea 
+1	keep mind adapter not new medela pumps i n't recall year cut adapter , research purchasing the cord length great : would easily spaned length vehicle the speed pump faster using adapter vs regular electric cord , i used slower speed i pumped no complaints 
+1	these seem working i started using month prior due date preparation breast feeding i n't baby yet , i find 's 're supposed ! 
+1	i given hospital i delivered baby major latch issues they worked well exclusively breast feeding longer need pump use bottle two weeks later , one annoying nipple shields my problem i n't wear e g night medela suggests nipples would get flat , i purchased extra set wear time wearing 24/7 cause irritation initially breast milk solves everything , i make sure air area every feeding keep clean not problem i hope longer use i wo n't wear time i also find long i n't wear anything low cut nobody would know i wearing , i not huge side i n't know makes difference as additional bonus built catch leaking milk eta : 6 weeks pp i longer need wear shells much , done job i wearing maybe 8 hours per day still love ! 
+1	due inverted nipples not really knowing help ( nurses lc hospital n't much help ) , i n't well breastfeeding first child gave 1 wk made feel like total failure heck , i n't even know i inverted nipples nurses told ! i got pregnant really wanted give breastfeeding another try time around i began researching much possible find i without using nipple sheilds give hospital i found blog site talking helped women situation i ordered they arrived quickly great price i started use i around 8 months pregnant since i using made considerable change shape nipples they n't inverted like used ! the cups comfortable wear well they make weird shape bra i would n't running errands anything i wear i 'm housework barely feel wearing them i feel like breastfeeding much better success time around cups ( and information i learned since last time around ) 
+1	this first baby i got sore cracked nipples breastfeeding i tried everything help heal using a & d ; original ointment tube diaper rash & all-purpose skincare formula - 1 5 oz nursings , pumping two days nursing times , thing worked heal severely cracked nips ( if , wipe a+d breastfeeding/pumping harmful ingested baby ) i would n't recommend leaking they seem make leak , i rarely leak not using they also soak clothes n't empty very often , bend pick something ! i see useful collecting milk breastfeeding they larger i imagined , n't noticeable wear padded bra 
+1	i rarely buy anything without looking reviews this works fine protecting even issues i prior giving birth 
+1	girlfriend complained nipples sore breast feeding great reviews got them she loved , dont touch ur nipple aggravate yet still catches leakage 
+1	i almost ready give breastfeeding resort full-time pumping i tried my nipples extremely sore , raw , tender , i would tear whenever son latched it ruining whole breastfeeding experience , i felt guilty ! i got softshells within days nipples felt million times better they keep nipple erect , helps latching , air-circulation healed cracks raw areas they little awkward get used first ( think wearing 'cup ' boobs ) , i find pretty discreet clothes , especially worn nursing bra/top my complaint cups fill sometimes ( let feedings ) , 're not careful leak bend side , even foam inserts so sure check , like whenever go restroom its amazing much milk collect small inconvenience compared beneficial softshells ! ! do n't give breastfeeding ladies ! 
+1	my nipples extremely painful first weeks my breasts large daughter handle first 2-3 weeks , i pumping every two hours needless say wore nipples quickly these shells - mother ( lactation consultant ) suggested - lifesaver allowing nipples air dry helped heal provided relief friction bra nursing pad however , also encourage excretion nipples , thus , would fill pretty quickly if n't feed/pump frequently and/or check often , often good chance would overflow , full slightest leaning forward would cause spill i think would work better could find material absorbant foam inserts provided once aware problem , though , 's easily managed overall , pros definitely outweigh cons 
+1	i bought daughter nicu i exclusively pumping i raw , cracked , sometimes bleeding nipples these godsend i actually passed best friend baby similar issues ( gross ? oh well ) 
+1	ca n't recommend enough i horrible case thrush this thing helped honestly 
+1	my son 9 months old took 2 hour flight visit inlaws since lap i wanted something secure since not buckled in i read flight attendants make take take landing they let keep son n't say anything flights ( probably n't notice ) i would suggest putting vest get plane it cramped plane made little tricky get vest i afraid would see make take you always put zip sweater vest the vest soft easy use wash i thankful i got land destination , pilot pull plane back there wind shear landing n't pull plane back , crash ( great huh ) so alarm goes cockpit it scary since ready land sudden going right back sky it bumpy i n't lose grip son , n't pull back , knows , , i could have bottom line : woth peace mind 
+1	bought daughter night flight & good piece mind , n't even use day flight back , moving around much would made mad strapped me good night flight though since slept much but still n't sleep really 
+1	was exactly i looking worked well quilted vest little heavy , though the baby blanket sleeper i would n't worry lost socks shoes way he got pretty hot sleeper vest plane took since air n't flowing well packed tight 
+1	i like , kept secure except strap slid along seatbelt unfastned this flaw design airplane seatbelts vest though 
-1	this not useful us we ended nursing baby throughout flight ( nursing recommended since helps baby 's ears ' popping ) , strap flight vest not long enough baby lie knees nurse so meant n't use vest ! 
+1	c & oacute ; moda 
+1	i really wish i 'd bought birth i got months breast feeding loved they really best wearing privacy home visible unless 're wearing bulky sweater however interested reserving every last drop precious breast milk appreciate ! also , soar nipples provide little relief the fit bra hole around nipple allows leakage flow undaunted , i found fit good everything leaked reservoir designed wearing around day helped collect extra ounce half milk ( foremilk , still good stuff - hydration essential ! ) would otherwise wasted clothing 
+1	this useful collecting milk breast breastfeeding comfortable used time good product 
-1	bought theses for my daughter in law and she said that they were uncomfortable and that she was unable to use them 
+1	not fully awake ( caring newborn ) ordered thought ordering extra breast cushions pump ( would nice ) clearly not read carefully surprised got however , thrilled also looking something like ( different name recommended ) work great pump nurse leak side when nursing would soak daughter pumping not much better , least little girl would n't soaked : - ) using typically catch ounce worth much daughter n't seem notice n't getting soaked , n't seem care sure did i 'm happy came back order extra set emergency pump kit car i enjoy saying best accidental purchase far : - ) -traci ( using shared hubbys account ) 
+1	these best inventions breastfeeding moms ! when i first started breastfeeding , milk would leak like crazy side i always thought would nice someone design something catch leak milk n't go waste then i found work amazingly ! i remember i able save 1 oz milk 1 feeding session when i engorged pain night , say 4am , baby n't wake feed , i longer go wide awake wonder i get pump ( not easy decision i 'd hear baby cry every time after i finished pumping ! ) nowadays i would get put shells go back sleep milk would leak nipples give relieve i continue sleep the problem plastic n't mold perfectly breasts , milk would sometimes leak edges/sides instead letting cup catch i 'd try lay position milk wo n't leak edges but even leaks , still lifesaver least i wo n't pain anymore able get rest baby cries i wish i knew i still pregnant - i dealt crazy engorgement pain milk first came i crying calling lactation hotlines back i much pain sleep deprived i could not process advice i wonder would like i shells back ! overall i highly recommend product ! 
+1	i use morning first feeding i leak whatever side daughter not nursing i use milk n't go waste protect clothing if i used protection clothing sore nipples i would not rated high i first , not made really large breasts they set nicely nipple , certainly not cover much areola area if i wear , breasts would look like large mushrooms they nice privacy home , though the shell fits breast comfortable it easy clean soft i would recommend use collecting leaking milk pumping feeding i would not recommend wear going miss feeding know leak wear disposable pads also , i would n't recommend sore nipple problem either large breasted 
+1	this one essential products every mom i used 1 month though , time nipples sore it sanity saver 
-1	i used remain dry baby nursing side i reach nurse-dri shells i received free hospital first these big bulky i hate design compared shells i reach shells dirty plus hate recommend certain length time 
+1	my wife gets lot milk leaking side a feeds side b we bought o-cal-ette nursing cups time these view far superior design o-cal-ette ( hole milk leak ) , hole leak milk , well actually come two cups , one holes , one without , use one without great also 're apparently comfortable enough put feeding however ! these not 5 star n't hold enough milk ! so still wondering find product fit inside bra similar way , passively collect larger amount breastmilk 
+1	these great help protect sore cracked nipples just n't bump anything wearing ouch ! but i prefer hard shell insure sore nipples protected you ca n't wear regular bra give weird shape i wear work contoured t-shirt bra ca n't tell i 'm wearing my breasts look bigger , weired shape contoured bra i wear nursing bra home 
+1	you absolutely not wear public ! this home use ! they not match contour breast 's totally weird bulge boob wear so said , wear home , great ! if really raw nipples offer much needed relief ability get air i use night catch anything i leak , i pour milk baby 's mouth via little spout edge i find i go longest without nursing night , offers great way never waste drop ! 
+1	i use night time since little girl decides sleep 6 hour stretch night i sleep , n't move around the problem sometimes milk gets silicone hard plastic sometimes causes leak i wake big mess it happened couple times though i use every day i also wear day nipples get worn feeding , helps pain ! 
-1	i bought hoping nice alternative losing milk escapes i become full definitely not product there way hide things , hard plastic apparent 
+1	finally relief poor boobs ! as mom breastfeeds tough nipples sore cracked these provide relief bra breast pad rubbing allows air get nipple allow heal i put nipple cream sore nipples wear breast shields get break ! definitely must breastfeeding !

+1	this must moms dads i used everything little kit far , except dropper i keep diaper bag times ! 
-1	i bought one one another brand , put one car the one worked great , bar bottom one warped sun within first week it simply n't worth anything , since brand cost durable 
-1	i bought 2 pack coupon got free , not even worth free it terrible product the suction cups constantly coming whole shade falls not seem safe baby sitting i threw right trash first years makes better product 
+1	they spoons , really i say they go fine dishwasher i like pretty colors , soft tips two thumbs 
-1	do favor stick gerber spoons another brand these not dishwasher safe ! ! ! ! i used couple months ( ten month-old n't start solids 5 months ) after month use , spoon color started fade bleed change brownish yellow stain one they awful i wo n't use anymore i 'm worried could getting baby 's food i highly recommend avoid item 
+1	i use spoons lot feeding eight months old twins the handle made stainless steel spoon basin made bpa phthalates-free plastic ( i emailed manufacturer find responded quickly ) the colors vibrant first soon started absorb color carrots sweet potatoes i would give spoons five stars not i hand wash , i not say withstand dishwasher made china not ? actually , i found spoons made gb : avent weaning spoons 2-pack , pricey 
+1	when son born , tried sampling bottles several different manufacturers , including evenflo , triflow , avent , etc dr brown 's bottles really best preventing gas , bottle leakage , flow problems we ended throwing bottles away i read reviews small parts difficult wash , i n't really problem we n't dishwasher i end hand washing everything each set bottles comes tiny brush getting small spaces inner parts bottles ; regular bottle brush works fine bottles i wash fill 9 bottles 20 minutes ( perfect timing putting son nap ) as reviewers complaints leakage , 's true inner tube gets full sometimes milk leak top - happened rarely i 've found i unscrew cap pull inner tube put tube back ( basically reassembling bottle ) , problem resolved the adjustment takes less minute like i said , i 've happen twice otherwise bottles , nipples parts really durable - especially nipples when first bought bottles , bought replacement nipples level 1 ended returning never needed so , suggestions are1 hold buying extra nipples see really need ( least n't open package need ) and2 bypass getting 4 oz bottles go right 8 oz bottles we started 4 oz bottles , 3 months old , son already 6 oz feeding so , pack away 4oz bottles go buy bunch larger size

+1	this bottle eye catcher 's different i see works son less fussy loves soft texture nipple although son loves , i hand hate comes washing how come 's many parts wash not , pieces tiny ! but sacrifice make young 
+1	great price 2 shields i using shields since day 1 daughter i quite experienced i trouble using , actually like thickness i wear daily daughter issues shield either overall great price 2 shields !

-1	i used temporarily since initially nipples cracked bleeding my husband gotten nuk-barely walmart i ordered ( since i pump loved ) another brand amazon see better , failed miserably my daughter latched without problems nuk-barely , hated i believe since thicker bulkier disliked after trying use multiple times , i gave ordered extra nuk-barely nipple shields do n't waste money 
+1	these abit thicker medela ones gave hospital baby seemed like better great latching problems ! ! 
-1	my nipples difficult latched baby and i feel pain i feed everytime i really hope one solve problem disappoint it hard stick tightly breast , baby latched rubber nipples , become warped sides , sticked baby 's cheeks , 's funny the important thing smells not good i sterilize even thought ads said odorless i tried not use 
+1	these ok worked great advised , n't inverted flat nipples using solely cracked bleeding nipples , baby could suck ends nipples holes it also leaves baby choking milk fast flow 
-1	i could n't find comparative reviews different brands nipple shields i trying decide one purchase i ended buying medela nipple shield ( 20mm ) , philips avent nipple protector tommee tippee nipple shield here reviews pictures 3 different brand : medela contact nipple shield ( 20mm ) this brand recommended lactation consultant it 's made thinnest silicone 3 brands `` sticks '' best the height nipple part little high baby often makes choking sound trying latch beginning i love medela brand makes two sizes : 20mm 24mm it comes one shield , makes expensive 3 philips avent standard nipple protectori purchased based looking product pictures , hoping would not high unfortunately , high medela nipple shield , also wider thicker , making difficult stay place get baby latch comes 2 shields tommee tippee nipple shieldthis nipple height least three brands in theory , extra cut outs along side nipple part supposed promote skin skin contact , another reviewer stated , making nipples sore would get sucked holes comes 2 shieldstake look pictures see differences side side i hope helpful search nipple shields 
-1	the silicone thick , hard keep might handy kid super biter otherwise n't feeding issues 
+1	good quality , nice soft plastic i trouble sides flipping onto little boys cheek not biggest problem ever , distracting i think medela shields worth dollars 
-1	i bought i wanted badly breastfeed daughter latch-on problems i told nipple shields could helpful this i went avent overall , i super impressed products i use bottles pacifiers happy customer past i n't really recommend specific nipple shields i ca n't get stay place really akward my daughter dislikes using i ca n't get nurse these if market nipple shield , go medela brand ones those much easier use less akward baby 
+1	these shields amazing ! i 've used breastfeed dd since born ( 2 months old ) - bf without incredibly painful , even good latch my baby super powerful suck also tends bite falls asleep nursing ( often first weeks ) without shield , 'd get painful damage wearing shields made experience bearable they super easy use wash sterilize quickly easily 
+1	these favorite nipple shields far ! i tried medela brand prior always trouble staying place the avent nipple shields allow skin touch baby soooo much afordable enabled purchase i get night time feedings also durable n't seem get flimsy medela repeated washing & sterilizing 
+1	we using dr brown bottles exclusively , little one getting gas seemed fussy meals we bought one ventaire bottles- try- ended fast flow nipple- much fast three week old so , bottle sat unused bottle rack week i found slow flow nipples local store i brought home tried bottle again- difference ! ! ! first , much comfortable hold compared dr brown ! secondly , much fewer parts assemble- wash thirdly , importantly , little one much less fussy gassy meals i went today bought 3 6 ounce bottles- size came slow flow nipples we going keep dr brown bottles , playtex ventaires new go bottles ! 
+1	i tried dr brown avent feeding systems encountered several annoying problems both nipples flowed fast causing son choke gag , led terrible gas spitting every feeding i switched playtex ventaire system , costs considerably less , found solution my infant son rarely spits hardly gas problems nor i administer mylicon drops every feeding i ! in short , feeding experience underwent drastic improvement upon switching ventaire bottles furthermore , even though breastfeeding , son made seamless transition ventaire trouble all the hitch ventaire bottles find ( not ) nipples small holes milk flows slowly , all one last note ventaire not make `` wide neck '' bottle , admittedly easier clean however , i found big avent dr brown 's bottles ( 8-9 oz size ) cumbersome , especially storing fridge diaper bag the ventaire bottles slimmer profile much lighter pack store every baby 's needs different 've got pick system works best for particular situation , ventaire best possible choice 
-1	as single , first time mom beautiful 7 week old baby girl currently using drop system , i wanted try bottle i n't continue buy things so i saw , i jumped right , since supposes help gas colic like drop ins , little i know going pain ! i read reviews saying could & # 34 ; actually hear air escaping bottle ! & # 34 ; this not case 1 there many bubbles bottle drinking i afraid going give gas not help stop gas 2 after washing one time reassembling like instructions said , leaked place bottom bottle ! talk frustrating screaming baby wanting bottle ! 3 to heat drop bottles i would warm cup water microwave drop bottle with , n't work ! after waiting 10 minutes screaming arms bottle formula still extremely cold ! i run hot water 10 minutes not freezing , still really cold ! and 2am n't want sit water running forever bottle still cold definitely not worth money time ! save headache n't even consider bottles little one 
+1	i 'm not sure going discontinue ventaire bottles getting extremely hard find stores , well replacement nipples & discs my son prefers bottles others all pieces pain butt , bottle flows well & sleek design i 've used bottles first born ( 6 years ago ) happy see 're great quality i another newborn 
+1	these bottles son use course design discontinued i took away star i got pack 3 pink bottles figures fyi - dr brown 's nipples fit bottles exactly playtex still get store way cheaper trying find playtex ones 
+1	these bottles baby take without gagging choking nipple she loves i thought i would never find right bottle , ventaire maybe gets bigger okay bottles i use 
+1	these bottles well made stand constant use newborn the bent shape make comfortable use feeding ease transferring nipples make good swaps baby particularly bite-y one issue parents , n't want upgrade newborn stage , i n't think good upwards first year child 's life the size setup n't really seem like something anything newborns regardless , 's good newborn set satisfy needs , used conjunction breastfeeding & formula 
+1	i actually like bottles use formula avent breastmilk , habit i think little less burping using , extra parts clean take bottom nuisance we never leakage problems 
+1	being new parent , i not sure bottles use i bought another brand-i say hands better , daughter issues gas hiccups 
-1	the idea bottles good they help reduce air however , , not worth b/c problems nipples it seemed like every nipple sort problem every bottle i bought newborn bottle- newborn nipples ( i double triple checked ) , reason all different flows ! some would choke gag , n't even work nothing would come , okay get point it always guessing game bottles we constantly try keep nipples good ones ones n't work and hungry , fussy baby , fun wasting time trying keep stuff like on top fact 20 bottles 2-3 nipples worked way supposed another issue nipples colapsed ! it horrible he would suck 10 times nipple would colapsed i felt bottles poor quality like i said , idea ventaire good , bottles n't expectations 
+1	i 've used kinds different bottles years cheap wal-mart specials avent dr browns bottles much closer higher end lower here break i like n't like pros : -baby n't seem much gas using these -it easy clean inside since top bottom come off -they easy baby hold cons : -since top bottom come 5 pieces clean bottle , takes lot room dishwasher -the nipples seem little faster others i 've tried , first baby made big mess using n't used fast flow -the nipples tops close looking avent bottles , sometimes i put wrong ones one leak so summarize , i would get bottles perhaps avent bottles , since less pieces clean , favorite i 've used 
+1	we 3 month old introduced bottles wide returning work the vent aire bottles seemed like good choice since 've get rid older bpa bottles kids used the work advertised , allowing air replace milk volume baby eats removing vacuum pressure bottle cons : _you ca n't warm bottle hot water , since bottom n't water proof_more pieces maker sure clean , dry , assembled correctlyi probably would not use one carry bottle , filling right using other son sees burp less , working advertised 
+1	as i said previous review starter product line , theplaytex ventaire advanced bpa free wide bottle newborn starter set , ventaire system vast improvement old standard every mom , nanny , babysitter , grandma caregiver familiar - playtex nurser sytem plastic bag inserts supposed create vacuum baby fed , cutting gas discomfort while were massive improvement , ventaire newest texhnology allowing better pressure equalization , cormftable feeding experience mother baby closely mimics natural position breastfeeding this done using specially angled bottles exlcusive ventaire disk system i started newborn set i 'm little adept inserting disks place using bottle i 'm pleased making clear bottles bpa-free since 's issue concerns new parents experienced parents new baby long time bottle duty i read complaints slow flow nipple i found i not encounter anywhere near frustration others reported however , newborn sized bottle it take little getting used swithing fast flow perhaps creating waterfalls milk formula infants face chest , check medium flow nipples available amazon : playtex bpa free ventaire advanced silicone nipples , 2 pack , medium flowthe set pictured 9 ounce set 3 bottles fast flow nipples if already needing 9 ounce bottle , probably not need slow flow nipple anyway , know slow flow , medium flow fast flow nipples separately 2-packs amazon i picked medium flow nipples locally better success earlier i difficult time finding i 'm pleased see amazon carries three nipple stages it 's best stock since 'll go nipples faster bottles , petty sturdy easy clean i n't use bottle warmer since i pump i warm milk refrigorator pumps packaging i not see traditional bottle-warmer would accomodate new system personally , i 've never need i imagine may deal breaker moms still , newborn set would make nice gifts either new mom one struggling old playtex nurser it takes little practice - couple days , get hang i quite pleased results 
+1	you open ends bottle makes easier clean does not leak designed even flow great product ! 
+1	works perfectly ! my son enjoy drinking without slurping , coughing spitting he fell asleep today drinking bottle - something never happened regular bottles super easy use clean nobody use regular bottles available my son almost 2 months old likes slow flow nipple quite well 
+1	these great aware fast flow nipples my son four months old used slow flow nipples & # 8211 ; come fast flow i purchase set slow flow nipples & # 8211 ; make huge difference & # 8230 ; my son not drink fast ones & # 8211 ; leaks everywhere not get anything & # 8230 ; 
-1	let start saying used playtex ventair bottles first child the bottles great -- durable well-made we used throughout `` bottle-hood '' -- year no problems however , began using second child we excited hear bpa-free past experience playtex bottles , happy purchase these within 3 weeks , ink bottles came so use sharpie pens mark ounces and within 3 months , began leak we bought 20 bottles various number stores so stuck 20 leaking bottles require sharpie every weeks perhaps washed dishwasher really , bottles prepared handle that please n't waste money bottles they appear great first go downhill quickly 
+1	my favorite part bottles nipples they wide tad bit short babies latched wonderfully nipples *the slow flow nipple very slow but 's good thing most slow flow nipples drown babies the slow flow great breast milk the medium flow nipple great 4 months , formula , cereal *the fast flow nipple amazing ! it works great dr browns bottles ( vent aire nipples choice dr browns bottles cereal come fast flow nipple perfectly cutting nipple these bottles much easier clean dr brown 's , provide fluid flow dr brown 's without deal middle insert dr brown's the cap bottles `` touches '' top nipple therefore bottles not leak diaper bag this major reason i love bottles two things i dislike bottles *you not mix four scoops formula 8 oz water bottle there 's room shake so i pre mix formula pour bottles dr brown 's room bottles accommodate water powder *these bottles crooked not straight , difficult prop with twins , i prop bottles sometimes mom 7 , rn 
+1	i chose exclusively bottle feed children , i 2 1/2 year old girl 3 month baby boy these bottles ever used i would say durable ; new baby still able use daughter 's bottles , held entire year drinking bottles continue hold we never warmed formula i n't aware issues others stated not able microwave whatever , since dishwasher sterilizes , n't use separate sterilizer either it definitely takes awhile drink slow-flow 1 month old able switch fast flow kind 's problem with daugher try wide playtex bottles well avent , milk flowed sides mouth switched standard i would definitely recommend bottles standard , seems fit little mouths perfectly 
+1	i n't baby i gave bottles friend use give feedback her response good told best feature micro-channel vent technology keeps air back bottle rather mixing milk she indicated baby burped less noticed spit-up using bottles she also liked form bottle seemed easier baby hold i noticed others said air vents leaked messy i asked issues regard said didn't playtex always made good product seems bottles certainly category 
+1	breast feeding wonderful trying supplement bottle away challenge finicky babies these bottles wonderful well accepted `` alternative '' 
-1	these bottles suck ! a complete waste money , maybe daughter use play dolls years road they huge pain use for one ca n't use bottle warmer ( water seeps bottle ) we hold running water takes forever it took daughter forever drink bottle nipples if concerned gas use dr brown 's bottles , parts easy put together 
+1	i babysit friend 's 5 month old boy days week he still spits quite bit age i thought i 'd try bottles his mom uses regular , straight bottles the first time i used bottle n't seem many air bubbles bottle usually when i burp usually spits least little bit first time , n't spit i thought sure must fluke i 've using bottles week 2 spit ups ! i 'm thrilled mom ! 
+1	pro-these great reflux , upset belly twins con- there pieces clean : including nipple 5 things per bottle n't like wash might not ( i mention i hand wash bottles factor still worth using ! ) 
+1	there n't enough room describe i love better brand ! i read reviews multiple bottles buying bottles 20 years these recommendations i find personally fit it 's hard determine sometimes ! 
+1	after trying medela , avent , dr brown 's bottles , i found worked best son and the medela avent venting system , causing nipple collapse baby getting frustrated the dr brown 's bottles many small parts pia keep clean the thing , baby different prefer different bottles - even vehemently negative reviewers product understand like any brand bottle , perhaps purchase single bottle going 3-pack see works well baby in case , worked perfectly i recommend give try 
+1	i thought baby bottles pretty basic , improvements playtex made seem make difference when sarah , daughter , recently gave birth , received earful advice well-meaning friends relatives also new moms many used recommended playtex ventaire baby bottles sarah listened , starting ventaire newborn bottle gift set ( wide bottles & nipples ) she also standard bottles ( slimmer bottle/nipples ) at point time , mom baby seem prefer wider ones sarah finds easier clean ; baby likes nipple shape better that preference probably change baby gets older wants hold slimmer bottle faster flow milk of course , n't advice went along ventaire bottles sarah warned might leak improperly tightened ( n't overdo bottoms ) , pieces wet assembling ( particularly vent area ) she never put dishwasher ( motherly advice ) even though playtex information says pieces top-rack dishwasher safe as result , bottles work well baby rarely spit-up , burping gas problems mom baby happy 
+1	i 'm certainly not mother - gave new mom gave rave reviews she calls `` high tech '' bottle loved way prevented newborn gulping much air 
+1	title says ! i 've tried lot baby bottles : dr brown , nuk , tommee tippee , born free , & avent these playtex ventaire far favorite ! 
+1	i like bent neck since i n't use bottles i nothing compare 
+1	after trying many brands styles bottles , wife i agree playtex ventaire best less pieces doc brown , excellent venting system , inexpensive nipples replace baby grows need higher flow 
+1	i love playtex brand , ventaire bottles really good i like bottles angled helps gas the thing sometimes leak , i make sure bottle parts completely dry i assemble mix formula these save much money compared drop bottles they definite keeper 
+1	we smaller ( 5 ounce ) versions favorite ( compared medela avent ) so naturally went ahead try ones they nice slow flow , provide `` air vents '' bottom however , i must note vents like 99 % gimmick you hear air come like twice per drink ( like hour little one gets tired sleepy every time eat ) we used quite bit , really virtually difference gas 2 add fact virtualy never hear air come , get idea the shape nice , especially baby trouble holding food feed upright position overall nice baby bottle baby highlights : - convenient shape- slow flow ( pro con depending want ) - ventaire system gimmick 
-1	pissed understatement i purchased bottles decrease amount air daughter sucking bottles came highly recommended the first set i purchased began leak bottom around cap i thought bad batch exchanged another set last night i feeding daughter i thinking drinking milk leaking side cap neck onesie new set ! i switched bottles gave another one this morning i shake bottle sink make sure rice breastmilk mixed good feeding cap i checked popped breastmilk went flying sink 6 ounces milk gone ! these bottles leak bottom many uses ring around cap warps n't screw stay flush bottle i done point bottles going back bru i going i done beginning go dr brown 's bottles i would never recommend crappy bottles anyone ! 
+1	unlike previous review loved bottles , yes baby spits alot bottles make difference our son loves bottles , help gas spitting able latch drink major effort we also love different choice nipple sizes both children given ceral bottles young ages doctors first poke hole nipple hope worked with son able buy stage 2 nipples not owrry getting much formula fast these wonderful 
+1	we four-month-old daughter using playtex ventaire standard bottles past month notable success they worked nicely following reasons:1 the bottles not cause dreaded `` nipple confusion '' transitioning bottle daycare breastfeeding baby mom 2 although lot pieces , fact bottle disassembles completely makes easy thoroughly clean disinfect various parts the bottles presented one challenge:1 replacement parts - like extra slow flow nipples - hard find nipples wear , wanting extras hand , i ended buying extra bottles instead nearly impossible find slow flow variety ( cheaper buy extra bottles amazon pay exorbitant shipping two sources sold nipples separately ) update ( 3/2012 ) : as daughter reached first birthday , playtex ventaire favorite bottle transitioning breastfeeding bottle feeding we also used playtex drop-ins this two compare:1 the ventaire slow flow nipples much slower drop-in slow flow nipples , preferable baby accustomed breastfeeding ( control milk flow , thus less gagging spitting ) 2 once baby learns hold bottle , discovered ventaire bottle flung wildly around not leak however , drop-ins bottle leaks everywhere turned upside-down ( baby will turn upside-down ) ( in cases , refers slow flow nipple variety bottle ) 2 our daughter feed ventaire drop-in bottles , bit easier handle ventaire she feed one-handed sleep-eating ventaire grasping recessed bottle bottom holding straight air the drop-in bottle requires use two hands due fact wider 
+1	we die hard avent family becasue daughter tummy troubles but n't seem working they great reducing air intake , seemed leak awful lot she would covered time done number 1 nipples plus reason husband mother trouble bottle leaking so i started research try bottles we hated liner nursers , hated dr brown 's , paln jane bottles allowed take much air so stuck avent last week my cousin little girl traded bottle try guys out well , steralized traded ! her daughter great avent n't leak our daughter great vent aire not leak i guess depends teh child but , great she manges keep mouth n't fill air they also afforable avent anotehr plus 3 months much wants hold bottle , almost she wrap hands around pull feet extra support hond this feat makes happy lack leaks tummy aches make us happy 
+1	here 's baby bottle round-up , favorite playtex ventaire playtex ventaire : these excellent let extra air ( like dr brown 's ) make easier baby continuously drink mostly really easy clean since unscrew bottom i feel lot better getting really clean easy throw dishwasher the downside take little longer heat bottle warmer sometimes hot water warmer gets stuck bottom drink sides get baby n't wipe give they n't fit medela pumping stuff nipples flow , fine baby 6 months i 'm bit sure make slow flow overall , favorite ones listed below dr brown 's : also pretty good overall many parts ( bottle , nipple , screw lid , straw thing little venting part ) i somehow managed lose bunch random parts i 3 complete sets they also kind pain clean , long straw thing hard get clean they work pretty well overall little inconvenient they also fit medela pumping stuff , nice medela : these least favorite they work well medela pumping stuff 's they also 3 parts , nice , n't anyway release air i stop baby drinking every release backed air lansinoh momma : these bottles little gimmicky i 'm not really sure good breastfeedng babies , i think 's big gimmick the flow way fast baby 6 months reason little girl decided point n't like they also n't work pumping stuff weird shape , makes hard fit bottle warmer i would pass 
+1	we switched using almost allplaytex ventaire advanced standard bottles 9-ounce , 3 pack ( colors vary ) main bottle the nipple ring tight nipple stiff , bottle design prevents nipple collapse makes airflow work perfect combo never got gassy tummy spend money , buy good stuff my choice standard nipples playtex ventaire nipples since began using nipples no leaks the problem hard find these bottles hard find , amazon actually best prices go ahead buy 've nothing loose free two day shipping ( www amazon com/mom ) the nipples n't want order online found target they best price stage two nipples , since not offered amazon unfortunately good luck , hope helps we love 
+1	do n't read negative positive reviews just try bottle just get 1 bottle store see works try different nipple just find works thats it it 's different different babies we tried dr browns , playtex wide nipple nurser ventair the stage 1 nipple slow baby would suck 30 min get half 6 oz ! but i got stage 2 nipple works great ! it says fast flow i would say medium my baby chokes often drinks dr browns she never choked drinking ventair 
+1	if n't dishwasher , hard get bottle clean - especially rinsed & tossed diaper bag day away home these made cleaning much easier since top bottom come surprisingly , not leak ! they also really reduce amount air baby takes feeding 
+1	i love bottles they not favorite kind , i pleased i gave 4 stars nipples came good replaced , i satisfied 
+1	a couple years ago , bought lot ( probably really needed ) baby bottles offered different options we ended using n't wash often , i say playtex bottles best help prevent gas colic we plan using types next baby make things lot easier although shape bottle slight tilt , i n't think really makes difficult dry one special racks the side occasionally couple drips milk coming bottom bottle ( not sure i something wrong allow something done prevent ) comparing playtex bottles others tried , i say playtex bottles one bottles trying prevent colic gas the brand i think dr brown slight dripping n't entirely unusual bottles , glass bottles got would actually drip nipple would screw we n't experience drips medela , plain bottles nothing address colic/gas issue so i would definitely recommend playtex bottles make great gift expecting parents 
+1	i 'll start saying liner-based bottles thing past i 'm not sure anyone would still consider so , thats positive product already this set works well mainstream brands i think leaked significantly less comparable models and leaking , i mean leaking caused milk grooves lid screw lid that gap killer many mess made grade ; 4stars 
+1	first foremost i love bpa free that important us house plastic products this decent sized bottle not small , not waste space large we definitely loving angled bottles vs straight bottles no leaks ! 
+1	i prefer ventaire bottles wider nipple bases these nipple bases really narrow if looking nipples likely better breastfed babies , i would go wider nipples because difference , obviously tops not interchangeable , bases wider bottles thinner bottles interchangeable these easy use wash , make baby less gassy , hold bottle i need i still prefer wider bottles , though , since generally breastfed i switched ventaire bottles drop-ins , tommy tippee avent bottles i like best 
+1	these bottles working great 19 5th months although i agree fact cheaper bottles trick , children prefered i tried a lot nipple any way , ever intentions , 's child 's going choose bottle ! ! 
+1	these bottles really work 5 week old son they worked since started using week old i guess air escapse bottom instead baby 's belly , found minimal gas needs less burping it not , however , decreased spitting my husband i tried least 6 brands bottles playtex drop-in 's sucessful us i actually see bottles reducing air intake whereas ones seem like gimic anti-colic mechanisms not readily apparent also , nipples bottles smaller the new trend large round nipples like breast might better babies going back forth bottle breast babies bottle fed , sometime smaller nipple easier young congested 
+1	the best ! not get less gas , i hand wash bottles easy clean yes requires taking apart putting back together , i know every speck bottle gets clean i never single leak i love use eth bottles different flow rates easy son hold i recommend use next time well 
+1	these bottles durable lasted long time minus little fading , bottles look new parts still work well 
+1	great bottles i got great-grand son due march mother pleased receive good bottles 
-1	i 'm actually not fan bottles , , problem lies moreso nipple my son spent half energy trying suck formula even going size , n't seem make difference i gave feedings also , manage actually eat , would still get fussy gassy- issue bottles claim reduce in opinion , better bottle options 
+1	i bought use nursing footstool i love but i easily see using long i done nursing it 's perfect size shape , cozy pocket feet , lightweight enough kick way i need get hurry highly recommended ! 
+1	great small , lightweight nursing stool soft feet providing support need nursing sitting comfortably i n't seen anything else like perfect small nursery also easy tote around i would give 5 stars others mentioned fact picks every hair pc lint minor annoyance i vacuum mine often roll lint brush since i pets 
+1	this perfect little stool accompany rocker glider it light weight throw closet n't using it super comfortable feet great height nursing really happy ! a great price compared expensive matching ottomans well i live nyc apt space premium this perfect alternative us ! 
+1	after given finding good footstool nursery , i saw friend 's baby registry price , try well , great so great i bought second one living room could stop carting around everytime i wanted breastfeed someplace nursery it 's sturdy enough i also sat sometimes floor now baby 11 months old , i still use holding rocking chair but surprisingly , become nursery toy ! now crawling , loves climbing and soft i 'm completely comfortable sometime 's i turn , lay belly flat side rock back forth little it mine start look little dingy use - time wash washing newborn clothes so i ca n't comment well wash ! 
-1	i love idea sling sturdy attractive , 10 week old son not get comfortable i keep thinking 's small getting lost , even grows i still trying make comfortable adding blanket position better i really want use sling , i feel like 's either deeply inside sling suffocate adding blanket underneath , 's close edge tumble the edge draws strings tighten not trick i 'll keep trying product seems like great idea not cheap , perhaps 's little much work newer baby if company consumer , ideas improve situation sling , i would love hear email : jul262003 @ yahoo com 
-1	my son 7 lbs 1 oz born 20 inches long he wasnt tiniest baby i tried putting sling looks like 's falling enveloped huge orange thing it 's worst product ever , i definitely not using probably donate goodwill 
-1	i excited get sling i love people n't realize i 'm holding baby wearing -- makes nursing even discreet normal sling n't draw attention people wanting see baby the outside zipper pockets great keys , cell , wallet , etc , style great ( looks like messenger bag 're close ) & i 've recieved lots complements my 2 mo old dd comfortable sitting it that said , i would not buy my daughter hated newborn & would immediately scream i put the drawcord needs knotted avoid danger strangulation ( unsafe , not mention inconvenient adjusting ) the sling uncomfortably narrow shoulder & n't distribute weight well 
+1	my grand daughter loves set the colors bright fun right size hand plus , durable bristles right 2 year old 's head 
+1	i used brush comb newborn the bristles brush soft , likes massage , helps rid head cradle cap the comb also soft , i certainly wouldnt violently run newborns scalp , gentle stroke works fine ! 
-1	looks cute colorful brush not bad comb bristles way thin/sharp/hard adults , let alone baby will returning set 
+1	say cute bug price great , cute , perfect grandchild ( bedroom decorated ladybugs ) 
+1	this perfect use 1 year old great grandson he loves looks like ladybug worm works great hair they well made pretty colors 
+1	love fact buy replacement nipples different stages instead buying new bottles wish would sell stores i guess stores would lose money 
+1	i wish i would known difference spouts ones younger children color fact made hard plastic others soft otherwise , difference i like avent spouts general leak proof sippy cup spout 
-1	as i stated trainer set , okay child takes , n't buy one set not sure child take i would recommend buying one set target ( grocery stores cary avent ) trying first if works , buy sets online you know within days child take 
+1	let start saying i think 's wonderful avent offer consumer option modify already ! i bought 2 avent bottles son use mom watched anniversary he exclusively breastfed & used 1 bottle , 1 time when doctor suggested starting sippy cups little bit water ( 6months ) , i really n't want run & buy something else would take space cabinets i bought guys & handles our son loves handles , really struggled spout i would go far say not drink i eventually caved & bought 2 nuby 2 handle cups soft spouts he drink super soft spout much easier i wish product would worked i screw nuby lid , spout not align handles the avents *always* align to sum , i giving 4 stars even though n't work family , ( 1 ) i love avent offers modification consumers , ( 2 ) handles rock & spout & handles align super easily , & ( 3 ) baby exclusively breastfed & little experience bottles ( 1 bottle , 1 time ) - i believe baby knows drink bottle would much easier time product 
-1	these create lots tiny bubbles son swallows drinks top it 's terrible design rubber back side covers air vent spout air gets sucked babies mouth instead back cup boo ! i really excited still use avent bottles transition cups , prodect n't cut , i ended buying sippy cups 
+1	this exactly i needed convert 4 month old sippy cups could used 11 month old thanks 
+1	we put spout cups this i call soft spout even though described hard easy clean kids love great design avent ! 
+1	like avent products imagine bottles turn sippy cups indeed spout totally non spill gentle baby 's gums wish picked different color white get stained give baby drink eating baby food 
-1	these not nearly good yellow ones they leak every time i use pura bottles used yellow avent spouts since beginning unable find i finally bought thinking would good they 're not 
+1	our daughter uses 2 sippy cups day i disappointed couple valves broke there slits ends valves allow keep seal & allow liquid flow a couple slits broke & sippy cups longer functional i went big box baby products store looking an employee told not sold playtex wants sell sippy cups she suggested i throw away cups & buy completely new cups instead i came onto amazon & found i grateful ! we extra valves case break 
+1	i 'm glad sell separately these fit cups fine we seem great losing inserts ! cheaper buy new sippy cups ! 
+1	buying lets extend life son 's sippys these valves make break sippy , glad resonable price 
+1	able find store bought online love better replace valves whole cup ! 
+1	these exactly inserts come platex sippy cups i glad find seem keep losing inserts i n't want replace entire cup due lack insert they work good original i bought smaller pack promptly lost inserts i 'm wishing i bought larger pack extras 
+1	we needed replacements sippy cups these work great i throw dishwasher call good little longer shipping hard find walmart half time 's worth 
+1	arrived quick always need replacement valves save cups i love playtex offers replacements , since brand cups n't when get lost broken , throw cups away 
+1	these typical rubber replacement valves it 's good extras hand i appreciate i n't replace entire cup 
+1	this works great master bath since oversized tub i need added height kneeler provides reach/bathe baby in ( smaller/lower ) tub , i use towel -- since step/kneeler would give much height cause bend hurt back so figure need added height buying if n't , go pad ( folded towel ) 
-1	this item great idea key word , 'idea' pros : - it 's 4-in-1 : elbow rest , knee rest , storage pocket wash/shampoos , later used stepping stool - cute little ice animal theme , polar bears , penguins , whales , etc - the elbow rest suction cups attach tubside - the little storage pockets hang side helpful crazy bath toys products babies come with cons : - what i not consider purchasing item placement bathtub 's faucet toilet we two bathrooms , bathtubs , side faucet toilet directly next generally , one giving child bath , would right faucet could control water flow/temperature with toilets directly next bathtubs , i ca n't exactly kneel 3 inches two porcelain objects hah i sit uncomfortably closed toilet instead lean whole time , sucks - the stool not raise higher picture shows it very short stepping stool , useless quite while - the suction cups elbow rest pop off almost every time lean , defeats purpose they hard get stay put first place anyone ever leaned it - also , top elbow rest cracked maybe 2nd time used it conclusion : i loooved idea product still n't seen similar product , i disappointed quality exact features , i frustrated not considering i could n't even use feature bathroom set-ups this sale next garage sale 
+1	we got upcoming arrival daughter but , first time i used clean tub husband gave dog bath it is awesome ! it 's sturdy alot padding i love arm rest , came loose couple times quick cleaning side tub suction cups solved i worried i read reviews product , i gave try i hooked our daughter dog never bath without 
-1	the kneeler not sturdy i not comfortable kneeling , i felt like weight would break right flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion if manufactorer considers cusioning , i 'm not impressed i might well kneel folded towel i hoping something would soft also , construction item not sturdy it made plastic , not seem durable the elbow & quot ; cushion & quot ; also not soft it not secure , either when i leaned test , slid right if i 'd busy bathing baby , i would tumbled tub i n't recommend product 
+1	this kneeler & step stool thing looks great we gave gift i totally wanted one seeing i think would really help knees & elbows bath time 
-1	i registered received monitor shower gift i thought would great my daughter 10 months i already bought another monitor within first month use hand-held audio monitor broke the video actually works really well aside noisy interference picks sometimes , great picture day night the camera kind pain , though the way angled , need mount wall crib , sitting tall piece funiture overlook crib i n't , really use sound the monitor large , though , would nice hand held auido one worked - i could take another room this model many problems i would n't buy i could 
+1	if considering monitor pay extra video monitor the picture clear adjusted lighter darker us like darker room sleep i simply could not gotten sleep first time mother i not able see son peacefully sleeping crib every time i opened eyes night we use video monitor separate hand held monitor time problems could not adjusted easily forget getting night long check angel buy video monitor instead 
+1	here update purchased 6 months ago/broke 01/30/05 okay ! maybe i paid attention reviews all fine , weekend dead ! the monitor went *do n't waste money you better purchasing system works pc monitor after reading reviews monitor , i thought purchasing would mistake do n't pay attention reviews ! it work great ! there many questions regards interference cordless phone i panasonic 2 4 ghz phone system ( 4 units ) home , wireless internet connection , many technical items , interference the monitor sits office desk next cordless phone system , pc , monitor , speakers , problems the picture not snowy the night vision element works fine i product 5 months not broken it nice able see baby now i let sleep stay awake without presence , know fine ! 
+1	update : i first reviewed item back april 2005 , daughter 4 months old she 15 months old monitor still working prefectly well we not problems night vision sound we keep monitor turned throughout night daughter takes naps the pictures lighter darker depending sorrounding light , make sure adjust accordingly we second child way deffinately using monitor him/her if breaks , deffinately buy another one once , become dependent : - ) feel free view 4 stars full 5 ! i must say i bit concerned getting monitor reading previous comments , i 'm glad i get ! the picture clear contrast options allows brightness monitor adjusted night i would 've given 5 stars , every i problem static all i 'm glad i got would recommend anyone ! 
+1	we love kiddopotamus products one exception we n't use anymore daughter toddler used since day daughter born brought home hospital no slouching , comfy cozy - definite must buy baby shower ( in fact i 've bought quite friends babies ) awesome yeah kiddopotamus ! ! 
-1	my daughter small , really seemed cumbersome use did n't really see need this-a much better buy mother insisted harness pillow support 
+1	i love snuzzler keeps newborn warm cozy - not mention better fit carseats my daughter 's 2 weeks old , looks comfortable car seat without , hunched - neck wobbling around i n't feel safely carseat she weighed 6 pounds carseat big i recommend product new parents you wo n't regret ! plus also use stroller and/or bouncers ! 
+1	the snuzzler perfect accessory infant car seat , especially newborns preemies the snuzzler reversable summer winter adjustable baby grows whenever baby outgrows , baby probably ready sit infant seat without extra support this worked much better rolled towels constantly moving it also important note snuzzler meets official flammability requirements towels not usually cotton extremely flamible - it 8 months later we stopped needing snuzzler infant seat 4 months old we stored awhile brought use high chair 
+1	my son big baby , checking 9 pounds 22 inches , headrests came carseat still n't offer enough support we fortunate received product baby shower he looked cozy fleece side cuddling well supported now 's 80 degrees , 've flipped use cooler fabric still loves my son almost 8 weeks old , tried taking carseat using headrest came carseat but , still n't offer enough support once falls asleep , little head hung side , put snuzzler back 's much happier it bit trickier get car seat straps safely adjusted around support , days hang

+1	other reviewers mentioned must smaller babies , daughter nine pounds born snug comfy car seat snuzzler she almost 15 pounds still using it snuzzler provides ultimate support `` hugs '' baby right places , little one feels secure comfortable we also use one stroller - extra padding i like 's adjustable grow baby , design allows used virtually anywhere - car seat , stroller , swing , high chair - name ! it may even used sleep positioner crib prevent baby rolling over we use snuzzler every day n't show wear it washes well ( n't shrink , bunch , fade pill ) may well serve one baby 
+1	it fast works great ! it much faster old fashioned way warming bottles , portable we 've taken town several times plus , n't leak ! 
-1	i wrote earlier review giving warmer 5 stars heated bottles fast cooler portion made easy use anywhere house travel but i noticed on/off switch sparked every time turned off luckily , i kept box i exchanged another discover second exact thing ! this huge fire hazard ! i contacted the first years problem far not rec'vd reply i even searched information recalls warmer found nothing maybe fluke i purchased two - i i wouldnt take chance problem , avoiding altogether buy different brand ! initially i would recommended warmer i say dont buy it ! the on/off switch needs re-designed safe use ( i would n't surprized gets recalled ! )

+1	this wonderful must-have i given shower gift lifesaver we use anytime need heat bottle , day night we prefer use instead heating bottle microwave , sometimes bottles get hot , probably may put little much water measuring tube but time , right we simply pour water warmer unit , put bottle , changing diaper , bottle heating by time done changing diaper , bottle ready we keep warmer room convenience in beginning used , cooler , kept forgetting put ice pack back freezer 'd taken 2nd bottle , use warmer truly worked really good us 
+1	this device great ! ! ! it heats bottles right temp fast fast easy use i could not live without the detached cooler great trips family functions keeps bottles cool reasy 
+1	this warmer worked great convenient middle night feedings not go stairs i used almost 3 months i went microwave i know everything warns not use microwave works fine much quicker now 3 month old sleeping night , i n't worry convenience factor otherwise , i would definitely recommend warmer 
+1	during first pregnancy i received night day bottle warmer gift i triplets night day bottle warmer could not hold number bottles i needed night i ended giving away i would not recommend product homes multiples you might able use twins get night when i became pregnant second time , one first things i asked night day bottle warmer there not many models there it simple use set the two water holders slide onto side warmer cooler placed back there couple different basket holders one bottles one jars food there chart side cooler you find size bottle using type you fill water number water holder when want warm bottle dump water warmer place bottle hit button button glow orange warms when ready light shut takes 2-5 minutes good features : on off switch cord very nice toddlers like push buttons indicator light tell bottle done warms bottle amount time takes change diaper very stable no tipping not top heavy even coolerfits many size bottles , see note dr brown 's bottlespoor features : water holder clips break shipping , inspect warmer soon buy itwater bottle cooler , must fill water does not stay frozen longer 7-8 hours cooler lock plastic bump breaks easily cooler longer lock one missing steam get cooler seal broken top not stay lock broken will hold 2 bottlesdr brown 's bottlesunscrew top enough not complete seal , warm bottle if not unscrew top remove straw , formula heating rise straw flow warmer when i opened box i discovered one water holders broken it plastic clip side then nights later i noticed lock cooler broken i emailed first years told broken pieces i never received written response week later new cooler water holder arrived mail the night day bottle warmer must families 2 story homes large homes it convenient remove bottle cooler , place warmer hit start better going kitchen warming bottle *update* 8 oz dr brown 's bottles not fit cooler unless remove cap 
-1	the reason i 'm giving 1 star not convenience provides others , not necessary another baby product market not needed i , first time mom , wanted baby products ! well i read reviews item , registered , received gift well found absolutely use if start baby warming milk , 're getting use i 'm sure everyone either receives arrowhead sparkletts ( ) bottled water homes well , water already room tempreature need `` warm '' bottle warmer device add formula bottle , shake give baby ! it 's already leukewarm the time i warm bottle 's fridge point , i run hot water warm my baby not 5+ mins wait i ! save $ $ and/or friends/family get ! 
+1	the bottle warmer must new moms it 's pain heat bottle boiling water - takes long this bottle warmer heat bottle 1-2 minutes -- 's quick easy the product held nicely n't take much counter space 
+1	i wish i would purchased bottle warmer beginning i purchased avent bottle warmer i using avent bottles i recently switch bottles purchase bottle warmer accommodate bottles little i know , bottle warmer works well avent bottles well the small problem numbers measuring cups rub week makes hard fill correct amout water size bottles i guess i guestimate point 
-1	i n't like product basically boiling water bottom bottle gets really hot use vent air bottle water drips bottom really hot i started using mircrowave seem heat faster way it takes forever formula get warm product 
+1	my children 12 years apart i wish would item first it easy use makes middle night feedings little tolerable if get routine : ( wake place bottle warmer change diaper bottle done time even time cool moment ) i one problem getting bottles 2 hot fault heating twice go figure i c-section lived 2 story house , trips saved husband going downstairs night well worth money 
+1	a bottle warmer many uses the first obvious use fact bottle warming 're changing baby 's diaper , getting dressed etc while complain takes 5 minutes , i find gross estimate it takes not quite 2 minutes refridgerator warm if truly took 5 minutes guess much water put resevoir the next great use fact 's easy dad - new experienced - figure use help it 's extremely easy use even easily used middle night the one weakness i found warming breast milk 's frozen it seems sort timer times long water resevoir boiled not let milk get hot if breast milk not opportunity thaw fridge yet obviously take 1 press button milk thaw warmed the problem even though 's still ice bottle water warm heating element heats water shut 10 seconds what i shake bottle evenly distribute temperature bottle add cool water resevoir 3-4 times this situation easily fixed however remembering ( easier said done n't sleeping much ! ! ) take bottle 12-18 hours advance overall , great product , great value must i would given 5 stars way set sort control tell bottle full frozen liquid 
-1	i use platex nurser disposable liners , i tried heat warmer sometimes would cold times would get warm liner would leak i would not recommend buying item it much easier bottle glass warm water 
+1	ok item something made life much easier us firstly let say tried a lot different bottles find right suction son went avent , gerber nuk , evenflo , playtex liners eventually settled playtex ventaire all bottles warmed quickly , quietly beautifully warmer it says takes 5 minutes , full 8oz maybe newborn bottles warm next time all put water , snap switch , let bottle sizzle away really short feed ease i keep small jug water next bed well case i need extra i n't go bathroom get the water holders bonus get enough light look inside see `` fill line '' anything like it heats pretty evenly i would recommend item anyone wanting bottle warmer we usually leave bottles room temperature , seeing 's winter , warm well worth money ! 
+1	i ended purchasing playtex nurser bottle drop-ins trying various bottles baby would n't drink these nipples lifesaver allowed baby easily switch breast bottle they much softer silicone nipples , allows easier transition i recommend everyone baby ! 
+1	i never thought i could feel much affection towards latex nipple that , i met playtex oh , i could bore details like call `` bottle wars '' took place home last spring , i spare what i tell discovered playtex drop-ins with , only with , latex nipples , cease fire took place peace restored home you 're going `` woman nuts , '' , nipples allowed , oh i n't know , take quick jaunt starbucks store sans baby finally would take bottle someone else ! ! ! i like call `` gas station bottles , '' n't fair , ways appropriate description : you find bottles anywhere they n't snooty like dr browns glass ones , like i many mama friends discovered , reason your moms used still available work work well go old school , get bottles latex nipples and thank later 
+1	this 6th bottle/nipple try daughter refused take bottle it finally worked ! ! ! and whole playtex system easy convenient use i wish i started not wasted much time money fancy hard-to-clean bottles 
-1	these nipples certainly n't & # 34 ; fast & # 34 ; anything water formula barely comes slower slow-flow ! the playtex nipples i 've bought n't bpa free work much better 
+1	i got latex nipples 'spare parts ' vintage baby bottle collection it decent price , saved trip go look : ) 
+1	daughter strongly prefers breast feed we went numerous different bottle/nipple combinations finally settling playtex drop-in nursers latex nipples they 're bottle/nipple take ( wo n't even take silicone version nipples ) now every baby different may not magic combination , even still days 'll reject bottle , great solution us if picky baby wo n't take bottles , i would recommend trying only reason i 'm not giving 5 stars quality control poor ; first 4 nipples purchased 2 nonfunctional ones ( hole ) ; i check nipple first making sure i squeeze water using 
+1	we hard time getting son take bottle , latex nipples playtex nurser trick ! someone recommended latex nipples softer silicone we started , used , transitioned silicone playtex nipples great product , especially bottle-wary baby ! 
+1	these first ventaire bottles i 've used , i 'm impressed ! the air bubbles really vent ! my baby n't great taking bottle , actually started drinking he seems like nipple i like angled shape bottle makes comfortable feeding the one draw back bottles two extra parts clean but i 'm washing bottle anyway , 's really not big deal i also like bottom comes it allows better cleaning 
+1	i love bottles my nb became accustomed breastflow type hard switch , due bad gas problems the problem i found nipples we got fast-flow even though 's savage eater , little fast gave completely our babysitter got fast went walmart bought slower-flowing nipples ( brand , fit ) swearing i bf baby , wean 'll sure get slower-flow nipple top use fast-flow rice cereal/bm concoctions definitely would buy i n't already stocked , haha ! one thing note : : these bottles do not work 're trying switch parts brand ( docking 1* ) it 's not wide neck breastflow gumdrop , not small enough fit standard hospital bottles medela brand if get brand bottle , 'll able use corresponding parts for us 's biggie , works best far proven pretty decent investment 
+1	baby feeding issues feed upright position ( nicu feed position ) other bottles hard use position , angle ventaire makes easy the bottles 5 pieces ( body , nipple , collar , base silicone vent ) they easy clean assemble , however not dry pieces well water drip around bottom , collar these white great boy girl i however prefer brighter colors old ventaire bottles came ( deep blues , purples , etc ) 
+1	when i first saw , i sure would leak , seemed like innovative idea i bought one anyway the bottle incredibly easy clean ends removed i unscrewed nipple ring bottom bottle i sure would leak i put anything liquid i filled bottle full water tossed around white sheet see leaked it n't , i still n't sure so , i washed bottle hot water i 've noticed bottles leak washed then , i tried sheet experiment it n't leak this bottle 9 months old still n't leaked i also liked bottles wide took similar nipples disposable bottles playtex , makes switching back forth playtex disposable reusable bottles much easier causes less nipple confusion 
+1	i use only children if looking slow flow bottles , ones i tried several brands , like born free dr brown even though born free claim nipple slow flow , infant chokes milk vent air easy assemble clean the angle makes easier hold bottle dr brown many parts clean store overall , really like bottles , strongly recommend 
+1	these bottles work well long parts totally dry i 've leak several times 's i n't let latex valve base air dry completely i use home would not confident traveling 
+1	i ca n't speak 'science ' behind design 'ventaire ' claims but good well-designed bottle daughter likes they different bottles not nipple nipple ring top 2 pieces bottom comprise 'ventaire ' system i thought first would hassle not much extra work clean ( pieces keep track though ) in fact makes cleaning bottle possible sponge since bottom top pieces taken put sponge either end if new bottles though i highly recommend essential piece baby equipmentoxo tot bottle brush nipple cleaner stand , orangethe bottle brush gotten us 15 months , could not done bottles without it helps well although not essential regular bottles in end daughter took right nipples 9 ounce ones seem flow well older baby if willing keep track couple pieces per bottle good trade 'ventaire ' system good bottle choice 
+1	the nipple one got rave reviews it not difficult baby drink nipple good reasonable size i like way bottles come sections make clean jobs easier you n't residual feedings left bottles reason the angled shape make easy whoever holding bottle the weight less evenly distributed leakage , minimal this also results less gas burping cleaner feeding time around 
+1	while first son almost never spit , second spits all time nothing ordinary , still good bit we 've using weeks , n't spit near much it may 's getting older eating baby food , i 'll gladly give credit bottles ! i 'm going point things bottles 've observed decide whether part positive negative -after using `` straight '' bottles , take bit getting used since top curved , 's easier spill formula n't turn lower side towards pouring in -the small bottle 6 ounces opposed 5 ounces bottles 've used at first , i really excited , still ca n't make 6 ounce bottle using powdered formula there 's not enuogh room mix so , still use 4 ounce bottle if using powdered formula there 's plenty room 're using liquid breast milk 6 ounces ( this set 9 ounce bottles , though ) -there 's 6 pieces put together bottle two pieces go together bottom , 3 top i 'll admit sometimes gets pain many peices , bottles days lot pieces -there 's different colors , 's variety i like colors gender neutral when 're putting bottles together take little time trying match tops bottoms according color , part n't absolutely necessary i like match , though -the `` slow '' nipple very slow ! the `` fast '' nipple very fast i would prefer if 're using breast milk , `` slow '' nipple perfect if put cereal bottle , fast nipple perfect it 's fast enough n't widen hole anything ( i think set comes `` fast '' nipples ) overall , very pleased ! even husband happy : ) 
+1	i think baby 's favorite bottle nipple shape like many others , i worried bottles would leak n't ! hurray ! i really wanted try see 'd cut burping they n't appear , least not significantly , baby not exclusively bottle-fed pros : - they n't leak ! - they super-easy get clean ( quickly ! ) bottom comes this great i 'm without bottle brush - the shape bottle easy hold baby although 9 oz size unwieldy young babies - dishwasher safe ! cons : - water get bottom cap warm bottles water ( realize 's easy shake ) - ca n't tell bottle cuts burping gas - i wish set came extra vent disk nipple like multi-size set 
+1	i n't particularly understand technology behind model baby bottles , i know i see plenty bubbles end bottles feeling daughter they always nipple bottle does happen anyone else ? i normally use drop-ins bottles i n't prefer one bottle i notice amount burping fussiness regardless whichever bottle i use i like bottle bent easier feed baby also , i n't notice first pack came fast flow nipples , fault i thought something wrong first wrong nipple , baby still requires slow-flow ones 
+1	we 3 month old introduced bottles wide returning work the vent aire bottles seemed like good choice since 've get rid older bpa bottles kids used the work advertised , we 3 month old introduced bottles wide returning work the vent aire bottles seemed like good choice since 've get rid older bpa bottles kids used the work advertised , allowing air replace milk volume baby eats removing vacuum pressure bottle cons : _you ca n't warm bottle hot water , since bottom n't water proof_more pieces maker sure clean , dry , assembled correctlyi probably would not use one carry bottle , filling right using other son sees burp less , working advertised 
+1	highly recommend buying online amazon prices store lot higher good bottles cause actually hear air coming bottom less colic , take apart getting cleaner bottle order different flow nipples recommend item 
+1	we love bottles ! they create bubbles baby drinking , bubbles dissipate almost immediately the bottles reduced gas seem nipples suck without bending compressing that said , 've difficulty finding replacement nipples ! the stores area sell stage 2 vent aire natural shape nipples the regular stage 1 vent aire nipples small bottles still , i 'd recommend bottles highly 
-1	bought boy acid reflux supposed eat upright i hopful would work well however leak no matter i tried leaked had others try , leaked they not worth money , i wo n't even attempt sell yard sale i dont want burden anyone frustration leaky bottle do not buy 
+1	baby not nearly gassy since switched bottles also easy clean 
+1	my son 3 months old birth extremely gassy he also reflux constantly dealing spitting , burping issues , excess gas i originally used dr browns bottles i heard so many good things well , dr brown 's bottles not work us i recently decided try ventaire bottle , based friend happy as soon i switched i noticed major reduction sons gas i also immediately noticed burping better , feeding i highly recommend bottles , especially dealing spitting gas issues putting bottles together extra step , lot less time consuming putting together dr browns bottles , 's well worth effort 
+1	now i attention , i like bottles whole bunch i used avent ( review ) dr brown 's ( review not yet written ) these awesome ! just unscrew clean parts ( not require lots time , patience , tools ) ! even husband figure ! now easy man figure fine art bottle assembly dissasembly the wider bottle easier adult hold seems heavier baby tries overall , 5 stars 
+1	bottles recommended pediatricianthey really help lessen swallowed air turn baby gaswhich helps lessen spit 
+1	i got i babysit nephew breast fed his mother started classes away 9 hours day he fussy `` bottle '' substitutions mom , adjusted quite quickly nipples while n't mom , consolable accepting system ! certainly makes feeding time mom 's away whole lot less stressful ! ! 
+1	we 've used avent bottles we like , happen use lost fast nipples avent my little one 6 months old , recently bottle breastfed we tried first bottle 4 weeks never trouble switching back forth i went back work these also seemed work great keeping burps spitup , though one extra piece compared avent , 's not big deal pieces large enough n't fall weave bottle dishwasher basket ( they also give extras easily lost part , vent cover thing ) we needed larger size bottles since 6oz per feeding , putting 6 oz 6oz bottles bit tight we also wanted fast nipples , i n't sure came set ( n't seem say anywhere ) well , got `` neutral '' colors ( green , blue , yellow ) fast nipples , perfect ( for reason , i ca n't find reasonably price set fast nipples anywhere ) 
+1	this bottle/nipple breastfed baby would take expressed breastmilk she flat refused others we use blue nipples daughter older ( thicker plastic ) , used clear natural nurser nipples younger product still worked n't leak 
+1	i tried regular version bottles , too i babysit friend 's 5 mo old boy , tends spit i thought would perfect try he definitely spits alot less bottles , far fewer bubbles bottle , i gave mom pack regular bottles i keep house use 's she loves bottles , , says uses it definitely makes far less laundry baby n't spit nearly much ! personally i prefer wide bottles , seem easier hold could i 'm dealing 2 kids time baby i used much expensive brand last baby 4 wish i known existed , 're far easier clean much easier wallet : - ) 
+1	i tried orginal ventaires help baby gas , n't seem like nipples , i found i bought right away he loves much better nipples he also gets less gas i find easier put together clean regular ventaires also 
-1	i ca n't even use bottles yet arrived fast flow nipples , although picture clearly shows box slow flow ones ! annoying , inconvenient , hassle thanks amazon urgh 
+1	my husband i beside newborn trying find bottle would like would n't create extra air she gassy ! we tried everything dr browns , tommy tippee , gerber none worked plus dr b tommy tippee much expensive she finally liked playtex ventaire ! ! the key wide nipples i nursing well get wide nipples the thing fast nipples ( come ) way fast ( started bottles 4wks i buy wide medium flow wide nipples work great ) she 's 7 wks fast nipples still fast tried ! good luck definitely give try 
-1	we loyal soothie line bottles forth , always worked well us i tried hoping would help baby sleep better less gas several problems right away she n't seem like shape , kind awkward it really hard get top , would n't leak and bottle not fit warmers i would n't choose one 
+1	would never buy bottle i 12 great i $ $ ones leaked not playtex wide ventaire they excelent great breastfeeding ( wide nipple ) i realized never many bottles boy ! ! ! : ) 
+1	my seven-month-old bottle fed since 1-week-old we started playtex drop-ins i happy bottles , sometimes i hate dealing inserts these bottles perfect companion the nipples interchangeable , son problem bottle change-up i really hoping bottle would easier son hold since angled , i think likes holding , yet hold bottle i find much easier hold laying i move around fits perfectly chin sits correct angle without hold unlike straight bottle falls easily the bottle unscrews top bottom the bottom seal pops easily simple clean they wash quickly i usually put avent microwave sterilizer my one complaint bottles come fast-flow nipples my son medium-flow bottle eater fast fast he moved medium 2 5 months , i n't see moving time soon i would prefer come medium since would used frequently begin moving larger bottles overall , great bottle i suggest picking medium-flow nipples little one using slow-flow since fast-flow big jump 
-1	these great first , loved size `` tilt '' feature however , stopped using nipples would clog we also use formula might clog-prone , n't problem brand bottles 
+1	we 've relatively happy bottles , i think may gone something different done research we got lactation consultant 's office day daughter born panic needing buy something our daughter breast fed mostly , used times week venting system : i hear air going back back end , i suppose job degree , i also see air going back nipple ease washing : i dont think five parts difficult wash/keep track the bottom stopper take bit attention make sure formula isnt remaining washing though dont use bottle brush put bottom stopper cause tear leak we 've generally handwashed bottles parts , put dishwasher success leaking : we ususally least one bottle week leaks we havent able identify exact cause , far see , 're clean assembled correctly the time consistent leak troubleshoot , due bottom stopper tear inner ring replacement parts : i 'm really confused bottom stoppers not available stores also , sell three packs bottles two packs nipples ? so nine bottles eight nipples silly having not used anything else , i ca n't really compare parents parent 's group seem use something different seem happy choice whether dr browns , medela , etc 
+1	i absolutely love bottles when i brought newborn home i n't sure use i knew playtex good i problems telling many oz water bottle according scoops formula when i found ventaire collection i thought great husband problems ear infections children he refused take regular ventaire i tried natural shape never gone back it best bottle i ever seen 
+1	these bottles really work ! i skeptical first , son actually seems less gas eating bottles i found results avent bottles , cost the downside bottle 5 parts , n't dishwasher would pain clean you also know plan pump bottles need adapter 
+1	i happy try playtex ventaire natural shape bottle 's daughter although older ( not newborn ) i quite tired upset dr brown 's bottles using since birth they discolored greatly , yucky stuff caked inside inner tubing , hard clean , constantly leaked month two owning i replaced twice time leaked screw cap area if make tight leak , loose leak , fine line soo i opportunity try something compare i quite happy so right bat i liked design , way top angled the nipples natural shaped daughter went old bottles without hesitation trouble nipple in fact likes better seeks wanting bottle the state 2 nipples fast flow perfect i like bottle top come clean entire bottle easy , rather fight most importanly though not leak the last thing want travel bottle leak , spill coming cap areas of course flip bottle upside leak nipple but none leak screw cap area , i happy not leak we used well month , going two love ! feeds baby virtually bubbles less gas spit ups it unique leak-proof bottom vent controls bubbles angled 9-oz bottle promotes semi-upright feeding deters ear infections natural shape nipple designed switching bottle breast safe breast milk 2-end opening easy complete cleaning includes stage 2 fast flow nipples comes light purple , light blue light green colors made hypoallergenic plastic imported 6 75hx2 25 '' dia colors may varydesigned babies switching breast bottle transitioning breast bottle feedingventaire advanced bottles easy clean come leak-proof , breakproof guaranteebpa freemade playtex - a leader infant feedingcolors vary : boy-white/green/blue , girl-white/yellow/pink , neutral-white/green/yellow1 this nipple new baby likes she n't like nipples older twin brother/sister used making transition breast bottle fairly simple , long i heat bottle milk first ! lol2 bottle easier clean sure comes pieces , i like fact bottom comes apart , i really get bottles clean the bottom conventional bottles would never get quite clean , even i use bottle brushes the brushes n't get crevices bottom 's thin layer dried milk something 's always there 3 ergonomically correct shape easy hold , baby hold well since bottle curves upwards , weight bottle dispursed centrally baby easier time holding it 4 it seems like i n't burp often , n't spit up 5 does n't leak screwed correctly 
+1	i love ventaire line baby bottles far favorite the wide bottle makes easier baby hold feeder also able hold assist baby i n't think ventaire get better ! 
+1	this bottle i 've used baby it keeps air tummy ventilates perfectly i 've using since day one nanny many years seeing different bottles act differently a lot moms n't colicky babies use bottle 's trustworthy product the ventilation system helps keep baby 's acid reflux control plus , bottom comes use sponge clean bottle you n't use bottle brush n't need if use bottle brush ( i sometimes ) n't get sprayed soap water opening bottles wide enough prevent mess they came quickly , well packaged i shopped around every time i i end coming back amazon excellent product ! 
+1	my daughter ( 5 months old ) exclusively breastfed since born 've unable find bottle likes-we tried dr brown , evenflo , gerber nuk , pretty much every kind could find , still luck i thought 'd give try since nipple wide short ( similar `` real thing '' ) take bottle ! in addition nipple good , air reducer ( attached bottom ) keeps getting gassy helps keep liquid bottle flowing smoothly without bubbling they come apart easily ( 4 pieces : nipple , bottle , bottom air vent , bottom ring hold air vent ) lot easier clean types bottles 've lot smaller pieces this set comes 3 bottles 3 nipples overall , i 'm very satisfied would definitely recommend bottles nipple picky baby ! 
+1	there many types styles brands bottles market 's hard know try use - often 's dictated baby chooses works best we tried many styles/brands bottles playtex ventaire bottles worked best us daughter - definitely noticed lot less spitting used bottles the design bottle easily reduces amount air baby consumes , assembled properly issues leaks whatsoever the wider nipple base makes easier babies transitioning breast bottle , purchase nipples different flow rate n't purchase new bottles baby 's needs advance i love playtex makes products bpa free , 's one thing love products as newer style bottles designed reduce spit-up/colic/gas extra bottle parts clean assemble - bottles vent piece goes bottom bottle , plastic ring holds place this minor draw-back really takes moment clean , i actually like allows get bottle brush way body bottle clean thoroughly any bottle not opening ends really limits clean able get it overall happy - 're affordable work well us - highly recommended 
+1	first , particular bottle set came fast flow nipples slow flow nipples bought add-on item , i could n't find slow flow nipples local stores as far i see , n't medium flow nipples bottle my baby mild colic ( unable bf , 's formula baby ) trying avent , evenflo mam , found bottom-venting bottles worked best reducing air bubbles baby this third baby 
+1	i 've used bottles three kids thing i 've found closely resemble breast we 've read nipple confusion concerned since kids attend daycare i still nurse i 'm all three kids took bottle issues i like take completely apart cleaning the two size option good baby grows appetite follows 
+1	these babies preferred bottles he gerd n't bother we tried regular size younger created bad habits nursed these wide nipples keeping latching correctly the side 6 pieces per bottle , upside 're easy clean thoroughly 
-1	dr brown 's bottles n't solve gas issue , neither playtex vent aire aside fancy name , playtex not reduce baby 's painful gas ( breast milk ) also , bottom leak not forcefully tightened - i lost 2 ounces precious breast milk lousy playtex bottles recommended women 's clinic for people produce little breast milk , losing 2 ounces like losing large 24 karat gold nuggets sink the number parts clean comparable dr brown 's bottles , dr brown 's bottles least provides cleaning brush clean interior nipple ; playtex , 're luck i think i heard venting taking place once playtex vent aire dry since , even dry , i rarely hear venting air all playtex make vent frustrations product reviews 
-1	i bought bottles baby big spitter they n't helped , one leaks like crazy place i calling playtex request refund 
+1	these great baby bottles my child not much gas since using product it easy clean parts come apart simply the angled neck easy hold baby sitting prevents excessive gas stomach 9oz good size bottle growing babies tremendous appetites also , 's great price compared well-known bpa free bottles ( $ 10 per bottle ) 
+1	this set great baby months old drinking i received neutral kit included green yellow bottles would appropriate either boy girl you get three 9 ounce bottles fast flow nipples i newborn playtex kit continue use slow flow nipples baby fast eater helps slow the nipples also supposed naturally shaped aid breastfeeding , baby exclusively fed pumped milk , i not attest ability the bottles different ventaire technology the bottom bottle twists rubber vent fits inside make sure twist bottom correctly , milk leak they little stiff , use easier twist tiny holes bottom bottle allow air escape , baby not taking extra air eating i saw bubbles popping could hear air escaping baby ate very cool the bottles shaped angle allows mothers hold baby upright position eating this helps reduce gas supposedly colic it comes narrow sides baby grip able all bottles come caps fit tightly , making transporting milk easier cleaning easy , twist top bottom remove nipples vents all parts held well multiple washings i would highly recommend bottles i also used avent , good , i believe ventaire technology made baby less gassy less fussy 
+1	reviews baby bottles wide ranging what works babies n't always work others all i say perfect us no spills no bad seals slow / medium / fast nipples brought nine month old along perfectly i would rate ventaire system 6 stars i could 
-1	these bottles horrible , first i got two brand emergency since i 've always used dr browns got contaminated dishwasher , i run get least two meanwhile cause dr browns wide neck hard find retailers area , used two bottles 2 days first come fast flow wich waaay fast little guy i would say baby younger 6 months old , i decided get two nipples medium flow , guess still fast , specially you gassy baby , last try i got slow flow guess , tooooo slow , it like nightmare , i use small 4ozs dr browns i home wich baby already drinking 5 ozs these playtex bottles leak horrible , place bottle warmer even worse get water middle bottom rim , leaking anyways , amount parts clean , i not mind i 'm used , cause i 've always used dr browns wich several parts , playtex bottles got baby full gas wich defeats porpouse bottles , make much bubbles nipples see hear , last thing nipple collapses bad baby stoped getting flow nipples really hard bottom line , i ordered 3 set dr browns wide neck shipping next day i 'll ordering second set soon dr b best bottles ever specially gassy babies 
+1	this excellent product works advertised the bottles n't leak , 're easy clean , nipple much better baby bottles they also nice shape look pretty nice too my one major complaint way product comes packaged it not include extra nipples basically product gives three 9 ounce bottles $ 12 ( current price ) for $ 20 , get theplaytex ventaire advanced bpa free wide bottle newborn starter set , includes five bottles , several extra nipples different sizes , extra bottle caps , extra vent disks the newborn starter kit much better value on hand , want bottles plain simple , definitely product buy very pleased 
+1	i love vent-air bottles - tthat using months i bought 1 becasue son used use avents hated nipple bottle the bottle fine i love comes apart becasue makes easy clean it kind hard hold becasue wide though i ca n't take many stars son 's personal preference baby likes one natural nipple n't mean like another

+1	we used product graco infant carrier car seat base worked wonderfully not police officer checked installation not tell us not use , said one coolest things 'd ever seen after showed really get base tight , seat n't move i think could lubed seat wd40 would n't slid around at first i thought coolest thing mesh container hangs front seat - great place stash used bottles , diapers , etc , recently took base install next size car seat , saw bunch caked spit-up nastiness never made onto leather , thanks mat ! those problems may need put little oomph behind car seat installation 
-1	i bought two thank goodness bru let take back they not grip leather seats , actually made car seat slide around i took back , 3 1/2 years two kids later n't felt like i missed bit these unecessary really pain 
+1	excellent product - - very very useful traveling ( electric plug points restaurants , hotel rooms airport gates etc ) very useful home

-1	like reviewers , i nothing problems thing ! the instructions much water add not right you figure much water use , , exact thing twice one time still ice cold time burning hot there little ring piece , not attached , lose , thing not work at all since steam escapes ! ours stopped heating consistently two months use it gets brown build-up bottom , not fit hand clean the instructions say wipe vinegar periodically , i found actually every day else never get build we switching munchkin brand bottle warmer one quit working 
+1	this warmer lasted us hundreds bottles jars food - i idea would useful i bought ! it 's small , easy use , heats bottles food exactly way son likes , i add whatever amount water i need this much water-conserving heating water microwave putting bottle - warmer uses teaspoons and heats fast ! this makes economical thoughtful baby gift - i already purchased two friends 
+1	we heat breast milk formula thing we heat plastic bottles , glass bottles it works like charm you quite careful measure right amount water , makes difference temperature 
+1	we last model first child got one cost ease use one thing know almost always takes & # 34 ; max & # 34 ; amount heat bottle adequately , note son likes bottle warmer side for money 's great 
+1	i tried bottle warmers definitely best especially consider price it gets bottle warmer faster warmers i yet over-heat bottle ( always check anyway ) 
+1	this bottle warmer easy use works quickly we 've using month n't single issue 
+1	i definitely skeptical reading mixed reviews product i decided try anyway it hard get amount water right i really like anyway remember , different bottles necessitate different amounts water it heats quickly , small enough portable , inexpensive i highly recommend 
-1	we disappointed bottle warmer twin boys we found heat one bottle every 10 minutes , real problem trying heat two bottles mess first time , cold hot , common warmer constantly adjusting much water put at 3am , much trouble also , lacks countdown timer , memory long needed warmer last time , n't water reservoir the dr browns much better , found one works great dr browns , first years playtex bottles 
+1	started use one 2 months ago since baby borned , work perfectly fine need try tem give baby anyway 
+1	i read lot reviews bottle warmers some claimed water would get trapped hard clean this one pretty easy straight forward it excellent job warming bottles it simply warm water 's compartment with said , pour much little water , alter results the downside wo n't let warm glass baby bottles i think 's great product price simplicity 
+1	this product works well abide instructions put suggested amount water ; not drop it 's important keep bottom reservoir clean , otherwise minerals water start collecting burn smell it looks like rust , wipes right i pleased performance price paid 
+1	my daughter would want bottles demand heating bottles long way not working i purchased hopes save time i would keep water vial filled water bottle needed heated i pour water heat was life saver ! 
+1	this works great ! the measurements heating accurate i wish buzzer beeping noise sort done warming bottle 
+1	this fast convenient way heat bottles i twins ca n't wait recommended 10minutes bottles cool i n't i n't problems i use first years gum drop bottles 
+1	after reading everyone else 's reviews , i nervous try product once i received ( i got 2 , one upstairs one downstairs ) , i read short easy directions , voila ! perfect warmth first use whoever states hot cold complains clearly not read directions not try tells not temp want to use simple tool , need know old school bottle newer wide mouth bottle many ounces bottle hold ( not many ounces 're using ) whether 're starting refrigerated room temp these factors tell much water pour heater using measuring vial comes press button ( not , i thought warmers broken ) 'll hear click see light go 's done ( minute amount time diaper change ) if leave done keep heating get hot , like 're cooking stove turn burner food keeps cooking keep rag/towel handy wipe moisture around bottle done the reason i give 4 stars measuring vial pain $ $ fill time exact amount filling water make bottle right temp , filling lines close together i 'm planning using syringe i fail safe , thoughtless , easy way get right amount water heater otherwise i 'd give 5 stars 
-1	i got warmer shower gift it warm bottle perfect temperature it drawbacks , though i took us 6 minutes heat bottle fridge it also developed brown crusty looking stuff bottom , numbers rubbed measuring tube we barely even use anymore not convenient hungry baby waiting bottle 
+1	i not problems others listed my warmer shut minutes warming never boiled bottles i found not warm chilled bottles using amount water recommended i usually warm twice use water recommended luckily , baby not picky it seems job plus reasonably priced 
-1	i bought hopes i could avoid standing pot boiling water middle night heat newborn 's bottle she impatient comes waiting i thought little unit would trick no such luck the product review says 's stylish cares ? what really need functionality usability warmer neither it claims heat bottle 4 minutes milk unevenly heated , top bottle cold base scalding the milk needs shaken even temperature real time sucker 're hurry feed wailing baby i tried vary amount water i poured heating base n't help i 'm lucky i n't throw away trusty little pot since i 'm back warming old fashioned way stove 
+1	it gets bottle warm quickly else i want bottle warmer ? do i need perfect ? no 's not i n't even use water measurement n't warm correctly maybe keep refrigerator really cold first time warmed according water measurement barely warmed i know dump max water amount ( sometimes ) test throughout warming cycle a full bottle i n't even need test i leave , change come back warm bottle the thing i hate brown caramel-like residue bottom i think maybe breast milk leaking warms caramelizing warmer it 's easy clean though 
+1	my complaint i i bottle warmer takes 2 cycles times get bottle proper temperature i not sure fridge set colder setting , i warming pumped breastmilk i 2 cycles almost every single time otherwise 's still cold infant son not want drink the problem upset crying i not home nurse , husband try calm fussy baby attempting warm bottle as per instructions , i *have tried filling 10 instead 7 really didnt help 
+1	we warmer second baby wish i purchased first born also this warmer easy use warms bottles pretty quickly crying baby ca n't wait milk it take tries get used much water use warmer perfect temp we overheat underheat figured it compact makes great travel we bought everywhere us ; friends , famliy , vacation etc ok i n't like i used vinegar clean often , still build bottom maybe kind water good recommendation put registry ! ! 
+1	this heats bottles fast auto turnoff , i still watch make sure doesnt heat would recommend 
+1	great product follow easy directions right temp food , formula , etc got gift use frequently love jar lift also would recommend item 
+1	i 'm not familar brands works well enough i use filtered water since gunk quickly inside using tap water i also keep close eye bottle go slightly warm hot quickly 
-1	this warmer works wants means 'm testing never i need warm bottle 3 ! i 'll plug nothing happens i already threw away box , 'm hoping amazon still let return ! i 'll trying different brand together 
+1	this really great product it heats 4 oz refrigerated breast milk within couple minutes it 's small enough stick diaper bag 're going , , since water vial cap , pre-fill the trouble recommended amount water not heat milk beyond cool temperature -- not even room temp after experimenting , i learned i fill half inch above highest number marking ( 10 ) order milk warm breast and i checked fridge -- 's normal temp , 37 degrees , 's not bottles colder normal so , i guess i 'm little concerned 'll happen need give 8 oz instead 4 ! *update* i use 8-oz size dr brown 's bottles ( heating inner parts removed ) , 6 oz milk , seem heat less water they also harder plastic bottles used use ( medela bottles ) , i think perhaps harder plastic conducts heat better keep mind experimenting water amounts just theory 
+1	one thing keep mind purchasing warmer : 's great price gets job done , 's not say n't better ones market you keep pulling bottle periodically checking temperature 's warming going times gets way hot but get hang , becomes second nature and 's definately bargain ! also , need worry forgetting turn first foggy weeks motherhood auto- shut ! ! ! this would great shower gift ! 
+1	this pretty good bottle warmer however , timer auto-shuts , alarm tell milk ready 's easy burn bottle i used many different types bottles ( e g , advent , playtex , dr brown etc ) works them i would prefer dr brown warmer certainly featureshttp : //www amazon com/gp/product/b0035llg2w/ref=as_li_tl ? ie=utf8 & camp ; =1789 & creative ; =390957 & creativeasin ; =b0035llg2w & linkcode ; =as2 & tag ; =justckem-20 
+1	unit works fine , warms bottles advertized - sticking timeline checking warmth milk -- i always double check - glass bottles warm quicker plastic 
-1	the last thing need put everything check bottle constantly every time wife tried warm bottle thing , either came hot cold having constantly check bottle became much hassle simply quit using warmer despite following instructions tee , bottles never came perfect we either re-heat bottle let cool giving baby to make things short , i 'll say : use stove microwave once get child reasonably predictable routine , warm bottles reasonable time easily without waste time money first years quick serve bottle warmer 
+1	bought second warmer keep grandmas house make life easier was hesitant cheap glad i got ! ! would pain fill little tube water everytime primary warmer home secondary 's wonderful is great bottles use food steamed passies fall i n't back ! 
+1	this bottle warmer big timesaver i put bottle , change baby 's diaper , come back warm bottle this less crying hungry baby , better the thing warmer trial error needed get going at first , figure amount water get bottle good temperature once figured , warmer easy use i also find cleaning every weeks letting vinegar sit little , keep consistant as gets dirty , tends become inconsistant i definately give bottle warmer 2 thumbs the reason i give 4 stars trial error needed figure much water bottle amount formula ( i use avent bottles fit great ) 
+1	i waited 9 months write review based purpose warming breastmilk first thing first , bottle warmer available walmart $ 15 i saw price amazon going $ 15- $ 35 so beware n't get rips off we using warmer warm frozen breastmilk 9 months issue other deposits heat plate even though using distilled water entire time we know warmer n't designed frozen breastmilk formila room tempreture however , warmer works better breastmilk expensive also due bottle storage use ( bags ) , wanted give bottle try in order get work , experiment find best amount water measurement pour steamer the milk bottle use medela plastic one ( ok high heat ) , stay away glass bottle get heated easy hard control tempreture now every bottle breastmilk different volume milk avg 120ml 150ml , i take bottle freezer , turn cap half open ( enough breath not losen ) then i fill measuring tube full ( n't even need number line days , useless purpose ) , i pour water , set bottle steamer , i cover coffee mug fit perfectly ( not tight ) , turn switch 3-4 mins , auto turn , usually 'll small cube frozen milk floating bottle , 's i leave alone covered another 2 mins i take feed baby if i 'm heating 150ml- 200ml , i steam 1/5 1/4 water filled tube everything comes perfect this thing awesome save us lot money highly recommanded !

+1	works great follow directions my husbands not good results n't always consistent , never problem : ) 
-1	this bottle warmer i ever used i really nothing compare however , i stopped using couple weeks realized son took bottle fine without need warm bottle it difficult get bottle right temp - either hot cold by time i acceptable temp , baby already screaming bottle the bottle would sometimes hot would leak top that left residue bottom warmer would emit weird odor might make think something burning you might better luck n't work us 
+1	we use playtex bottles disposable liners problem finding warmer stated could also types bottles this one it n't bad , sometimes days nearly boils formula next day formula might still ice-cold getting `` warmed '' we like auto-shut-off , 's 'd listen 4am feedings ( click ) besides occasional heating changes , drawback easy way clean , particularly live area highly mineralized water , marks measuring cup come within first month use i re-marked sharpie two water levels use ( playtex bottles without thumb slide ) friends babysitting son helping us heating bottle visiting know much put more likely toss son done using bottles buy another one next child definitely nothing fancy maybe not absolute best product , works great price paid 
+1	we purchased bottle warmer travel use we full sized dr brown bottle warmer 's big carry along short trips vacations pros : inexpensive not cheap it 's hard find functional bottle warmer price sized perfectly travel great use hotels 'll staying relatives it accommodate wide neck bottles we problem warming dr brown 's wide neck 8 oz bottles similac 's odd shaped bottles heats fast average warming time 8 oz bottle 5 oz formula around 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 minutes depending 's room temperature chilled cons : outside bottles gets really hot touch be careful lifting bottles bare hands no built water reservoir water measured poured every use warmer needs cool period least 10 minutes every use it not designed warm multiple bottles 
+1	they 're grandson , fine , , i recommend it works great time i answer came product 
-1	i 'm confused why would one even need product ? what 's wrong shaking formula bottle ? that always worked us 
+1	my husband i love mixer - first used munchkin one , n't like constantly hold button make work , one flip switch stays we use make big batch formula day ( daycare mandates bottles pre-made day ) works well i like helps mix formula clumps left need shake bottles 're done - i know nutrients distributed evenly/correctly this worth money ! **after 2 months use , though , first one purchased broke - not sure how/why , mixer came unit using , since purchased replacement hopefully n't happen *******edit : now second one broken well - starts making high pitched whining sound `` mixer '' comes `` base '' 're using ( 's turned ) 're mixing powder formula water mixing bowl - not touching sides bottom bowl***** 
+1	this fantastic ! i prefer mix formula one bottle time thing i could use short shaking bottle ( thus adding bubbles upset baby 's tummy ) it 's inexpensive lasted entire time i making bottles formula - year i really wish i one first baby worth i paid , sure ! 
+1	i happy find amazon com definitely worth price i often make bottles go people 's houses allows mix formula within seconds virtually bubbles ! i still using medela 5oz bottles fits easily inside just careful first time use ; goes fast could splash n't paying attention leave long 
+1	this mixer great i used daughter 4 bought another one son i dont like shaking bottles cause makes foamy i inevitably get formula also done mixing bottles great chocolate milk grown drink mixes 
-1	i tried dr brown system unsatisfied several reasons first , bottles flowed fast causing son choke gag every couple swallows not surprisingly , led terrible gas spitting every time fed secondly , i think bottles overpriced even worked , i would hard pressed spend extra money bottle feeding not rocket science mother pay much feed child successfully finally , although wide-neck bottles may little easier clean , also come parts standard bottles , evens anyway additionally , i found big dr brown 's bottles ( 8-9 oz size ) cumbersome , especially storing fridge diaper bag every baby different 've got pick system works best for particular situation , dr brown 's not answer 
+1	my son born 5 weeks early , weighed whopping 4 lbs , 6 oz because digestive system still immature , extremely difficult burp , caused major gas issues after going 2 bottles mylicon first 2 weeks born , i decided give bottles try wow ! i saw difference first feeding i went burp son , expecting spend usual 15-20 minutes trying get burp , imagine surprise two minutes huge burp came tiny baby ! and hour later , happy clam , past , would legs pulled chest , pain gas i n't understand problem people cleaning bottles so come two extra parts big deal i hand-wash bottles , sterilize dishwasher week , first washes , extra parts non-issue i also ca n't figure people ca n't seem get beige vent tube clean unless let bottles sit days forumla gets caked , simple soaking hot water dish detergent using special brush needed keep vent tube clean if n't work , always boil pieces minute sterilize , without pieces becoming distorted i also shake vents tubes washing dislodge water might remaining inside holes also , necessary , i seen babies r us store sell 2-pack vents , well 2-pack tubes case need new ones arises my complaint bottles leak fall side period time , little tricky traveling diaper bag i solved problem pre-measuring water putting one medela breast pump bottles ( come lids ) then , i 'm , i add formula breast pump bottle shake , i pour formula empty dr brown 's bottle problem solved ! i would definitely recommend bottles anyone newborn serious burping gas issues ! 
+1	we made switch playtex dr brown son issues spit gas the first thing i noticed bottles less dribbling feedings i not found cleaning problem you need use white disc bottles traveling keep bottles leaking ( even keep upright , still somehow leak ) , one solution i use pre-measure powder bottle ad water ready ( instead carrying bottles water adding powder ) it 's lighter diaper bag , less mess , easier mix n't completely remove components ( move aside pour water ) i n't fool popping white disc touching nipple i not give 4 oz bottles 5 stars stem barely reaches top formula filled 4 oz even though i like size , found better make 4 oz bottle 8 oz size n't worry blue tip covered formula 
+1	i bought starter pack bottles due fact daughter spit alot bottles tried we use , actually sleep taking bottle i know take longer clean , worth happier baby ! 
+1	i actually registered received avent bottles however , i noticed daughter trouble nipples ton gas my mother-in-law suggested dr brown 's bottles i bought one see would work what difference the gassiness daughter experiencing decreased alot i use 4 oz 8 oz bottles i bought extra inserts nipples i also bought travel caps i love bottles happy i purchased i would suggest anyone by way , i use avent bottle warmer 4 oz 8 oz bottles fit perfectly they also fit sterilizer ( laying ) 
+1	when son born , tried sampling bottles several different manufacturers , including evenflo , triflow , avent , ventair , etc dr brown 's bottles really best preventing gas , bottle leakage , flow problems we ended throwing bottles away i read reviews small parts difficult wash , i n't really problem we n't dishwasher i end hand washing everything each set bottles comes tiny brush getting small spaces inner parts bottles ; regular bottle brush works fine bottles i wash fill 9 bottles 20 minutes ( perfect timing putting son nap ) my suggestion bypass getting 4 oz bottles go right 8 oz bottles we started 4 oz bottles , 3 months old , son already 6 oz feeding so , pack away 4oz bottles go buy bunch larger size 
+1	dr brown 's bottles great ! i recently purchased bottles daughter suffers reflux needed rice added formula thicken feedings at time i using avent bottles not nipple accommodate thickened formula so , i purchased dr brown 's bottles used `` '' cut nipples thickened formula they worked great the downside bottles warmed , milk sometimes rises tube inside bottle causes milk leak warmer needless say , i clean bottle warmer several times now , i warm without top everything fine 
+1	i given dr brown 's bottle shower gift glad i got ! ( it different ones available online - 8 oz wide-mouth bottle ) when i stopped breastfeeding i started using 4 oz avent bottles several reasons first , i ended 8 purchasing avent products second , lactation consultant taught breastfeeding class recommended stating like breast when i started looking purchasing larger 8 oz bottles i remembered i received dr brown 's bottle decided try see daughter would take the wide-mouth nipples look similar avent ones my daughter `` smacks '' lot eats subsequently takes lot air she spit often would sometimes spit looked like half bottle trouble burping she took dr brown 's bottle instantly i decided buy switch week two see benefit i 'm glad i ! once i got past fact bottle looked big daughter 's head ( 8 oz wide-mouth bottles large ! ) , i realized burping much easily hardly spitting all i truly believe benefits using bottle outweigh extra parts clean after research i discovered one main reasons bottle-fed babies get ear infections `` vacuum effect '' traditional bottles as baby sucks traditional bottle gradually suck harder harder pressure builds bottle this also creates pressure ears disturb fluid balance cause inner ear problems the baby also frequently break latch ( nipple collapses certain point pressure causes unlatch ) pressure equalize bottle this causes take air now , daughter really hungry , take practically whole bottle without ever break latch ! i really like nipples well they much thinner avent ones mold better baby 's mouth i suppose avent ones thicker stronger resist collapsing pressure ? others stated leaking problem they will leak if:1 ) heat without loosening top ( collar/nipple ) 2 ) travel without putting disk top designed keep leakingdo n't things n't problems i definitely recommed least try i definitely purchasing shower gifts new moms ! i recommend wide-mouth bottles , though 
+1	i truly believe dr brown bottles ! our baby girl five weeks old bottles helped colic fussiness eating we used avent bottles nightmare ! she would cry eating , would get much gas we lucky found dr browns bottles these bottles must babies colic 
-1	as see picture bottles ( supposed ) clear not bpa free ones i ordered i wanted ones not bpa free i wanted completly clear when i recieved i sad see bpa free kind if i wanted bpa free ones i would order $ 7 cheaper per pack needless say i getting refund but apparently dr browns doesnt make clear ( non bpa free ) ones anymore : ( so i suppose i get bpa free kind , least i getting cheaper 
+1	my baby reflux extra gas makes completely miserable we got bottles 3-weeks old really make difference ! i 'm pediatrician , i skeptic i read bottle claimed reduce gas/colic but i think i 'm convinced ! at least , makes easier eat since negative pressure created suction food flows ! thus , baby swallows less air work hard get food if baby reflux gassy , bottle definitely worth try ! 
+1	originally i thinking buying playtex nurser system , did't want spend money little plastic inserts my baby bad gas , i knew bottles would help they proven best there parts bottle easy put together time and i 'd rather clean parts spend money plastic inserts it practically stopped spit-up , 's never colic , using bottles giving gas drops , 's got gas , happy baby ! i also like bottles easily connect breast pump -- -they say 's best pump bottle 're going feed baby , i n't know i bought 4 oz bottles newborn , use 8oz bottles i 'm trying spread word great things and n't expensive ! 
-1	i read reviews thought going answer cereal bottles bought 9 bottles total however , everything clogged never worked well all also , target lost order eventually arrived , weeks late then , i tried return refund , administrative glitch refunded us $ 0 we received correct refund day , multiple phone calls time frustrating a bad experience product worked poorly me not recommended 
+1	my son reflux doctor said put rice cereal bottle these nipples helped it took son couple tries understand not suck hard getting 's pro ! 
+1	i like travel holder utensils little one since not able choose colors , i hoping green blue i received i like came variety forks spoons ( green ) the cover easily snaps close ( fuss ) , washable , bpa-free , slim portable what i want product ? nuby makes great products i would buy item next baby ! 
+1	we like used often however , seven eight utensils fit lid case this n't matter much us , though - leave spoon home ! also , fork tips rounded , son little trouble spearing things he old enough ( fifteen months ) able use pointier fork , i checking soon see one sharper forks fit case and , says title , colors vary ours orange yellow , i like better pink picture since 's gender neutral 
+1	they work well it 's always nice extra nipples bottles they easy clean i recommend 
+1	i used evenflo glass bottles they work great evenflo classic 4 oz glass nurser - 6-pack 
+1	nipple flow rate right babies older 6 months easy wash good value be sure separate nipples ! slow , medium fast indistinguishable ! ! ! 
+1	like lot they great made material i change silicone nipples 4 months only works evenflo bottles highly recommend 
+1	these work great standard bottles i like i order online amazon prime avoids trip store 1 small item 
-1	we used lvl 1 nipples evenflo , avent , medela bottles problems these level 2s leaked bottles we n't using evenflo bottles anymore since drinks 4oz time at rate , 're leaking i 've thrown : ( 
+1	my baby always used evenflo nipples at 3 months , hard time getting milk flow 0-3 month nipples , bought 3-6 month 6+month nipples the 6 month nipples flowed fast even 5 months , 's 6 months , work perfectly 
+1	these nipples worked perfectly wore well easy use easy clean never developed stains either it helped came different sizes varied flow 
-1	i nipples given us hospital slow flow these nipples allow milk flow bottle upside unlike slow flows i 
+1	these good only problem i would say way tell fast , medium slow - markings so keep organized seperate bags when dr instructions feeding baby ( i , swallowing issues ) , need different nipples drag without system telling to figure , put liquid one see fast comes easier keep seperate time ! 
+1	these low-flow nipples helped grandchildren newborns 5 months they much less colic gas using i 've always used old-fashioned evenflo glass bottles , recently , become difficult find i 've stocked future grandchildren , i n't come across another type brand nipple works well 
-1	my son never used since boy ones i received pink i ca n't attest whether liked not maybe 's , colors may vary n't fly baby stuff unless colors neutral 
+1	i gave 5 stars soft well designed however baby n't like fault not reinforcing pacifier soon enough i bought try , hoping baby would magically take it might work baby , go ahead buy affordable 
+1	the paci seems nice shaped like bulb less like orthodontic ones my little one refused use paci , particular comes 
+1	let first say i n't buy pacifiers amazon , i n't problems colors anything this pacifier son 's favorite now old enough paci fits mouth , loves bulbous shape nipple he hold mouth easily , n't seem bother sore gums , teething badly with narrow base , compress nipple inside mouth without putting lot pressure gums the large round base makes easy manipulate , n't make goofy imprints face update : my twins 18 months old , not passi-loving boy still adore pacifier , typically thumb-sucking brother likes walk around one pacifiers mouth , we tried pacifiers , particular ones becoming difficult find local store my boy n't like only one we look `` bulb '' portions pacis , check wear , older ones thrown it 's not mark product though , since boys plenty teeth , like bite pull 
+1	first try i bought pacifiers , i bought grocery store ever since spit throw pacifiers , more half time 'll go right sleep i give pacifier 'll calm i n't give crap color not like daughter cares right anyways , long job help daughter stay calm go sleep all i care 
+1	i received 2 packages ordered time one pack blue one pink the pacis differ slightly photo not sure makes difference , ones i received rubber part pulled clamped paci these seem expel water inside nipple easier , good because i looked like one pictured difficult clear water washing then baby makes squishing noise sucking makes hard sleep my lactation consultant recommended originally angled tip ones cause tongue thrusting issues these tend help baby get tongue bulb this second time i ordered received style last time i got two packages pink i boy but okay , use sleep home since hard find retail ( wall***t ) often stock , using similar shaped paci avent ? i think outings i wanted get used different type case ran situation could n't find paci overall i happy product shipper ( preferred mart ) , i wish could pick color sent neutral colors 
+1	i problems baby not taking pacifier i tried give every single kind & hated i came across he took right away & taking 2 months know takes pacifiers definitely favorite 
-1	my baby kept gagging the teat big ! not impressed pacifiers do n't buy !

+1	i tried almost every nipple twins these work well daughter acid reflux she spiriting less since i started unsung nipples i going order 
+1	bought newborn i love ! it 's easy intake since i bought slow flow would buy ! 
+1	i latex nipples gerber bottles , couple washes felt sticky & n't ever seem clean so i tried & so much better much durable & easier clean since clear easy see missed spot formula , especially bottle n't get rinsed right away 
+1	it really helps extra dome caps i find i run dishwasher , inevitably least one flips fills dirty dishwater time cycle complete if rewash , simply misplace one , great extra given always lots bottles circulation , pays extra one trick get flipping dishwasher collecting water place four together face pin putting bowl top weigh do 'll always come clean 
+1	i use not baby 's bottle cap train baby sip regular cup i fill halfway water 8 month old sip she enjoys , especially summer hot , i give cool water she loves taking sips ! be careful let baby 's lips barely touch water could go wrong tube i know 's done lets water spill mouth , sort playing water

+1	this pinch guard goes easy ( comes easy rare occasion want close door playroom ) the kids used play door much talked taking someone always getting fingers pinched since got actually stopped playing door together since wo n't close i would given 5 stars little thicker - would also able prevent hinge closing little fingers too overall , says , good price , without permanent 
+1	i think sturdier others 've tried makes good insistant toddlers very good product 
+1	i try keep ahead harm kids like covers oven knobs lock proof top sparkletts water dispenser these great i put high enough kids ca n't get n't worry squished fingers my husband bought many ended using one remote tv kids would stop losing talk great way repurpose thing it sturdy stand time 
+1	this pinch guard great it stays place super thick it 's little pricey , get good product 
+1	we buying these we bought two originally keep door cracked baby room door cracked n't opening shutting doors time it 's enough let crying noise not lights rest house they withstood twin teething toddlers , fit doors great we live house doors 60s most bad reviews exterior doors slammed blown wind i say withstand slamming toddler really well 
-1	i high hopes little guys luck easy packaging literally open ready go i put one bathroom door worked prevent slamming son 's fingers , left gap side door hinges , eventually worked way crunch slammed instead : ( i sure designed one option door work , not address side i give 2 star i since removed found daughter uses elf ears dress awesome 
+1	i found couple local discount store sale i could n't pass i thought might little good true $ 1 50 i figured n't lot risk well , great ! we one 15-lite dining room door 20 month toddler sometimes close ( slam ) one bedroom door it makes feel much better not worry slamming fingers door it also helps bedroom door hitting squeaky spot ( go check night n't wake ) very easy take go grandparents/hotel ! 
+1	either way ones selling seem standard ones pictured not dropins title says dropins cost amount getting standard liners not hard use you stretch around bottle top , hold , carefully fill we left tabs bag say remove son never noticed seemed hold bag better unfortunately ca n't mix formula hard measure correctly pretty well dropins standard liners though stay air free better dropins way better also n't buy playtex dropins , store brand cheaper good 
+1	these worked well easy use tall people if not reach top closet door easily may want try find different product 
+1	it 's cheap it 's easy my kid 's cant reach my suggestion resist urge tighten lot , little hard loosen afterward as long 's snug , 's not going anywhere 
+1	bought keep little explorer pantry , linen closet , etc these work well slated bi-fold doors pros : can unlock mechanism open closet 1 hand , important baby handinexpensiveblend nicely white painted doorkeeps toddler rearranging closetscons : the locks n't sturdy thicker plastic metal lock would ( locks plastic ) toddler really wanted get closet , another year might able pull hard enough break ( but n't busted closet yet ) in , product says , keeps toddler pantry i recommend purchasing locks 
-1	do n't waste time one -- pops right top i n't found good solution bi-fold door , sorry 
+1	these locks awesome we slid folding spots preschooler 's closet doors the photo misleading makes look like lock middle doors , actually slide place doors fold , make sure order two 
+1	these things great ! they work well keep toddlers closets go flying forget 's open door bit force i purchased closets home found solid oak doors i remove adjuster piece get fit not issue i n't think work quite well without bit reinforcement i also purchased pediatric therapy place keep littles toy closets always told moms love want know purchased ! overall i believe work well training tool help teach toddlers places limits eventually kids figure yank door open send flying 
-1	unless 20 minutes kill baby screaming bottle , n't want i first used venture bru grandparent 's day breakfast grandma sitting 529 seminar , daughter suddenly discovered beyond famished - go car warm bottle ! now , supposedly warmer used dr brown 's bottles combination n't work us first , bottle positioned warmer certain way presses safety latch keep warmer unless bottle regular generic bottle gallon fluid inside , wo n't keep heating latch engaged i sit continuously push bottle onto latch and 10 minutes , bottle still ice cold ! i idea warm bottle car reccomendations , i tell mini blood pressure machine nothing benefit appetite impatient child 's hungry !

-1	these outlet covers complete waste money they perfectly designed little fingers pull my daughter easier time pulling husband tab sticks way makes pulling tempting bare outlets would safer 
-1	trust figure get outlets get old fashion one us parents hard time getting 
-1	absolutely worst ! the little notches side baby finger sized come right buy old school kind real safety ! ! ! 
+1	my daughter suffered serious colic first three months these bottles saved day they really work , trust , worth spend little time cleaning bottle peaceful tranquility newborn n't screaming stomach pains granted , not babies need , daughter certainly once get habit cleaning , 's big deal plus , baby gets ready cereal , dr brown 's y-cut nipples wonderful i n't know sell online , i get local bru store these bottles little expensive , i would paid twice price relief bottles gave daughter 
-1	i heard many good things bottles , success also praised avent system , i switched dr brown 's i luck product , either , parts clean feeding system my 2-month-old son spits even feeding ( sometimes twice ) dr brown bottles i not noticed less gas , either , nipples flow way fast , even though i purchased smallest size i 'm glad product worked others , , expensive failed experiment 
+1	love bottles ! i 'm primarily breast feeding , i use bottles , work great very little ( ) air gets baby & baby seems trouble transitioning bottles & natural nipples they pieces , easy disassemble , clean easily dishwasher & reassemble quickly very durable & leaks drinking ( although i noticed leak sometimes 're diaper bag & gets turned upside ) highly recommend ! 
+1	it true bottles quite parts clean , i consider totally worth my son less gas since 've using bottles i 've never problem leaking there 's line 're not supposed fill past , long milk n't filled past line n't leaking problem my son loves nipple , previously breastfed baby easy transfer bottle as another reviewer mentioned , n't even bother buying 4 ounce bottles at two months son already 5 ounces , barely got use the 8 ounce bottles need 
+1	in beginning , son terrible time gas bubbles stomach within minutes eating , would scream pain he difficult burp , help we tried avent bottles , made situation worse given odd shape nipples the first time used dr brown 's bottles noticed significant difference in short time , longer screaming every meal yes , 2 extra pieces wash , 's trivial compared alternative 
+1	i love bottles ! my 3 month old baby never problem spitting much gas in fact , i count one hand number times spit yes , extra parts clean get annoying , really takes extra seconds and , yes , inner tubing gets full , might leak little , opposite happens -- nothing comes but , like reviewer said , unscrewing putting back fixes the extra time cleaning putting together bottles definitely worth happy baby n't spit ! 
+1	i bought bottle evenflo bottles son born what big difference with dr brown 's son problems gas , burping , anything they parts clean , small price with evenflo bottles kept gulping fast would choke , hiccups lot could bottle making `` vacuum '' noise after two days , i threw away evenflo 's bought dr brown 's problems my son not problems going breast bottle best buy ever

-1	my mother purchased tjmaxx ross something i 've learned suspicious baby products places- seems like 've usually sort issue one buy sometimes issues dangerous like product i think blender pointless one could much better buying small food processor target something this dex one also cheaper walmart online this blender weak , n't blend quickly efficiently i 'm horrified read reviews learn plastic ring i not find mine ! i guess i fed baby plastic ! mine 's sitting plastic bag ready go goodwill maybe i throw away it 's piece junk ends ross 's poorly designed product do baby favor buy bpa free one somewhere else , freeze baby food tiny pyrex 
+1	i like little processor mixing small quantities food true , n't hold ton , i i bought - i make days worth time - holds 8 oz food comfortably time ( mixes well , etc ) - i think good size make fresh food try new foods ( without making bunch 's not hit ! ) - pretty easy clean- just 4 parts , easy assemble use- it 's not super heavy duty , i chop things good amount putting thereall , i think 's worth i n't regular food processor blender n't work quite right i thought harder get food mixed some hints i also found investigating making baby food : - after mixing want freeze , use ice cube trays each cube 1 oz 're frozen , pop put zip-loc storage - if 're getting started , i thought website useful good ideas - - wholesomebabyfoodgood luck !

+1	this plate n't perfect 's best i 've found it 's weighted typical toddler plate nice round edge scooping food fingers spoons i like n't sections lot times daughter eating something like macaroni peas n't need sectioned it not claim suction 're baby wont ' able pick need realistic expectations if child continually picks either decide plate n't developmentally appropriate yet try later enforce pick rule ( i yes 10 month old babies understand means ) the thing i n't like plate claims rubber base i envisioned whole bottom rubber 's actually outer edge slide bit however since i ca n't find anything better i used plate every meal snack past couple weeks i say overall i really like just fyi n't cut anything sharp knife make scratch marks i n't staining problems i 've served spaghetti blackberries several times ( i hand wash every meal ) 
+1	i hoping 11mo would not pick plate first thing , threw ground : ( that said , spoons pretty much amazing i get good amount food easily goes mouth edges thin 
+1	this solved problem baby picking dish dumping contents also , color 'frame ' rubber edge bottom , preventing slipping pushed around table we surprised reviewers thought cheap-feeling it sturdy high quality , one would expect high-ish price ; made sweden not ugly like baby stuff made days so happy , ordered another one

+1	these baby 's all-time favorite spoons they wide enough pick quite bit food get mouth without ( much ) mess , soft enough cheeks gums the low , wide base bowl makes difficult tip totally worth price

-1	i got son visit friends family n't drag high chair along we ended buy real booster seat anyway this seat unstable n't safe efficient 
+1	we first years booster seat 10 years straps hold seat chair snapped pulled ( husband ) he always pulled straps chair could tight could ( although i could easily , ca n't get quite tight ) we used 3 kids another ( baby ) , get new one i expect 'll chair least 2 grandkidds since baby last 
+1	this great traveled hotel i wish little taller since chairs short tables taller wonderful idea product 
+1	we got seat 6 month old it 's easy blow , folds small we take trips attach chair she loves sitting we use balcony well sit outside sit us easy clean , great price ! 
+1	i twin girls , when i would take friends i would take bumbo seats/trays i somewhere sit eat eventually outgrew bumbos i either stuck holding drag highchairs me then friend recommended travel boosters someone gave one christmas i looked decided give try i love them they not teeny tiny folded small enough keep one baby bag , carry stroller maybe size large , flat lunch box ? i leave car they carry handle lightweight it took breaths inflate bottom portion seat easy deflate time fold back up it strapped chair easily quite stable it n't wobbley anything it strapped tight granted square chair seat back ideal it way sturdy i thought going the base even though inflated air sturdy , solid firm the frame not flimsy straps nylon the two things i noticed : the seat smaller i thought would i use 14mo old twins also small side fit perfect unless hit massive growth spurt work way percentage chart i could see using booster well 2yrs old but , slender , small size the second thing seat small crevices pain clean smushed food i took note first use cover seat tea towel strapping kiddos overall - love i definitely recommend friend 
+1	it job no issues connector our doorway wide worked perfectly great 
+1	i worried extension would loose , threaten integrity safety gate but n't , n't , took literally seconds snap onto gate yahoo ! 
+1	this needed get gate fit large doorway it fits fine gate quality seems good , specifically feels heavy duty 
+1	unfortunately , gate probably buy extension the extension , easy install pretty much side either side gate so 5 stars easy install not much say 's likely must product , average size hallway need extension 
+1	we needed baby gates n't seem come wide enough cover normal hallway , extension works perfectly n't problems year everyday use my daughter even grabs rails shakes everyday held without becoming loose 
+1	this fit perfectly stairway space did order larger one realized tad big quick shipping well 
-1	this work ok i n't like fits included gate overall gate n't good one me i much happier summer extra tall gate 
+1	we buy hands free gate stairway smidge wide gate the issue come across bottom bar gate extension bowed little , believe shoe molding way walls , fixed putting 2 little pieces wood bottom bar far fixed issue other extension great i n't recommend using 1 though 
+1	we got carrier shower gift , really like i agree reviews 's little tricky get baby - get paid we thought buying baby bjorn , i think 's expensive carrier wo n't use much anyways so cozy rider also eurorider ( also infantino ) , much similar baby bjorn much better system getting baby - without waking baby , cost half bjorn so plan carrier occasional use , i recommend cozy rider i used supermarkets , mall , home , baby fussy wanted cuddle time it start hurting back ( 30-40 minutes ) , n't bother much the eurorider padding , helps lot , cost twice much cozyrider ( bought gently used though ! ! ) so , bottom line , great carrier price - easy adjust baby loves if plan hiking wearing longer periods time , might want look carrier padding ( like euro rider baby bjorn ) if not , one fine ! ! ! i recomend 
+1	to honest , loved infantino soft carrier we used regularly babies newborns time babies hit 12-13 lbs , carrier became uncomfortable , pulling shoulders causing arch lower back - not good ! my husband still could use till babies hit 15lbs , time around , went baby bjorn so - looking something first 2-3 months , awsome - baby snuggled cozy mommy 's ( daddy 's ) chest leaving mommy 's hands free - great transition newborns again , really liked babies small - 's looking , way go want continue using carrier past 3 months , i would suggest looking expensive baby bjorn comfort 
+1	this nice carrier baby feels really comfortable falls asleep we noticed take walk sleeps better night you need two people get it- 's downside but 's , 's super comfy ! 
-1	i bought son months old we lived apartment complex second floor , crazy drag teh stroller stairs i bought make daily walk mailboxes easy it worked great first when turned 4 months old i problems i packing car go trip it too tight around stomach spit teh back suv with i could n't even put two fingers carrier never used since 
+1	i give 5 stars avent products i problems , whatsoever , avent my grandson , 8 months , completely bottle taking formula , juice , water `` sippy cup '' we thrilled 
-1	great bottles used nipples , terrible design sippy cup attachment valves super tough remove cleaning , always cleaned i recommend first years clean & simple , valve free ! sippy cups they n't offer babies r us online store they 3 sizes , handles n't leak ! ever ! when making purchase right first time not like 4 sets later : ( 
+1	i love whole avent system ! these great sippy cups , large part avent pieces modular fit so , using avent bottles , put sippy cup tops handles bottles you pop magic valve makes sippy cup fit nipple bottle or , take collars bottles fit magic valve it wonderful ! especially since many ways fit sippy cup together already using avent bottles 
+1	i first admit additional parts cups need washed , since used dr brown 's bottles , i used pieces the soft spout cups great , made transitioning cup so easy us my son n't taken bottle since first birthday , never missed bit there two levels spouts , one harder one softer i 've tried soft spout brands , leaking collars avent cups never leak long valves inserted correctly our little guy use brand spout type , favorite nice sore gums i really recommend cups despite extra valve pieces ( i simply pop dishwasher basket ) you 'll never spills sofa carpet 
-1	this not horrible product some young children find spout easier sippies , used transition sippy switching playtex model they leak , hardly floods experience indication the biggest drawback real *pain* clean very difficult clean hand ( take something else vacation ! ) not convenient even dishwasher hand there many parts ! plus handle ring thingie n't fit bottle washing dishwasher basket two stars you might want try older baby toddler not adapting styles but otherwise give pass 
+1	finally we bought every kind sippy cup market hard tops , soft tops , short , tall , name , 've got and currently stored he loved cup finally , i got drink cup something flatness nipple fact soft , not soft longer my little man drank immediately hopefully , long , 'll getting juice ! ha ha ! we little problem avent bottles leaking , far , n't problem cup leaking i little cautious i purchased one because bottle leakage , i double check everything i hand i hate clean n't need cleaning jobs added my advice , try cup it worked wonders us 
-1	first , thing dries wipes , even add 1/4 cup water 're supposed add every couple days ! it also restricts kind wipes buy forget getting chubbs round container , instance the little storage area nice idea , 's rather flimsy not supportive your best bet would get one wrap-around warmers , cute pastel designs mold shape wipe tub these take far less room much easier clean , this one ? you 'll continuously wiping , n't fallen , 
-1	i bought wipe warmer , terrible the wipes bottom dry turn brown within days , insert `` pop-up '' wipes wo n't stay unit , comes wipes , making impossible grab wipe one hand the unit supposed snap top organizer , mine kept sliding i gave weeks took unit organizer , super-glued regular wipe container top organizer , i keep buying refills my baby n't seem mind cold wipes i still use organizer , though , i like it says holds 20 diapers , baby little , using diapers size 2 , turn sideways actually fit twice many two rows instead one they slide easily never seem get stuck netting the little pockets side handy tube diaper rash ointment , etc 
+1	we received gift love ! it warms wipes nicely when use unwarmed wipes baby gets upset changes perhaps spoiling ; - ) he winter baby i 'm sure appreicates efforts keep tushy warm the time i problems wipes drying i filled lid n't close tightly i accidently left open when happens , i added bit water restores nicely i found bottom wipe turn brown i keep adding fresh wipes top bottom ones older now i remove whole remaining stack add new ones bottom even slightly brown , looks weird i 'm pretty sure wipes fine i wish came pop-up adapter something i like pamper 's pop-up wipes find difficult pull one inner-folded stick together it works better huggies wipes the issue lid collects condensed water i afraid leaving puddle furniture so , i place folded face towel seems work overall despite minor issues mentioned i pleased product 
-1	like parents , i happy finding warmer reasonable price , worked well first year quit the organizer caddy handy it attaches side diaper table crib brackets included also included rubber `` things '' help adjust brackets smaller widths ; instance , attaching table instead crib the front caddy zip-up net inside fit 15-20 diapers there two pockets side i use keep small bottles lotion , diaper cream , etc the warmer snaps onto caddy wo n't fall top easily it also tendency `` cook '' bottom wipes turn dark yellow brown it seems problem warmers warm bottom the wipes tendency dry , i think case warmers i usually add bit water every keep ( although particular brand recommends , current one recommends to do ) i disappointed find warranty quit working i spent amount money one wal-mart 5 year warranty - long enough least get diaper stage ! specifics : it plug-in not battery operated i think units size plug-in it fits size wipes , not feature pop wipes and holds entire refill size wipes it warms bottom , not top it easy open lock lid you not adjust temperature i think though 
+1	the good thing product cheap gets job done my little one cries away home use cold wipes ! she really likes warm ones for awhile doctor wanted us use wash clothes wet water ( recommend newborns anyway ) i almost died thinking walking bathroom wet washcloth screaming baby every diaper change , product provided simple solution i wet washcloths stored warmer then wiped warm cloths conviently located we using wipes now there things i n't like there plastic things supposed make fit better side changing table they fall behind changing table lot annoying it n't fit great even `` sizers '' i also n't think diaper stacker useful i tied ribbon around would n't hang anymore also , warmer dries bottom wipes turns yellowish , brown i `` solved '' leaving wipes bottom time this good product money , n't mind taking bad good ! 
-1	we bought wipes warmer son 's room awful the wipes always hard brown bottom we wasted money throwing ruined wipes away we returned bought prince lionheart ultimate wipes warmer we 've one 8 months never problem burnt wipes i paid money bought one first place do n't waste money time buying wipes warmer- cheap regret 
+1	my son really enjoys jitter buggy , cute indicator lights sounds , loves vibration , 's 6 months sat happily hour i cleaning once gets bored one side , i turn seat 's facing direction i got sale great price definitely worth price it bit bulky , luckily apartment open layout tucks away wall , not portable ca n't really store i move room room without problem , even , i push kitchen family room nothing falls apart ( another reviewer wrote ) 
+1	i older version ( n't radio feature ) 2 sons well , i thought i done sold now i expecting 3rd boy back buggy ! i but even better , new features radio , cell phone , cupholder , traffic signal love buggy it kept 2 older boys busy hours i expect hope new son i love bounces , rocks , spins i think cuter traditional saucers entertaining i dont care traditional walker either ( i also carpet , n't really work anyway ) i got one gift smaller jitter bug i hard time getting son ok , doesnt fold compact like new saucers advertise , i n't mind b/c i happen like type entertainer much better , may one downside this not boy b/c car girls like cars ! highly recommended a+ 
+1	we third batch sippy cups twin daughters they simply use , come wonderful , vibrant colors , surprisingly hard generate messes ( bonus two children ) the cups sturdy durable they survive whatever abuse dealt we not yet problems cracking breakage lid , part understandably takes stress we use every day , replace fairly frequently ( start look dingy 'old ' ) , thus far quite happy cups however ! i wish not hard get clean we hand wash plastics daughters use , use dishwasher cleaning experience likely differ the problem i food/dry liquid gets stuck small groove inside spout it hard , even considerable soaking , get crusty bits space we toss cups soon becomes noticeable , slight design change eliminate space would welcome us hand washing these cups certainly fulfill mission i happy , i wish could get little mileage tossing ( since every little bit helps - replacing frequently somewhat expensive ! ) 
+1	i cups i using son , generally great , travel well i end taping mouthpiece putting cup ziploc plastic bag prevent milk getting everywhere i excited see travel caps imagine disappointment i realized seven new cups came one cap 
+1	i looking inexpensive sippy cups bpa free send daycare daughter , transitioning bottles breastmilk milk the main problem i many sippy cups i loved not travel lid these sippy cups perfect they inexpensive enough i n't care end lost as traveling , come one travel cap nice , instead , i also purchased thethe first years 6 pack take & toss snack cups , 4 5 ounce , colors may varywhich lids fit perfectly sippy cups most importantly , baby drinks problems ! 
+1	without reservation best cup ! our 15 month loves , easy use take couple us everywhere the lack handles benefit slow drip design keep spills minimum easy clean , easy baby use - perfect 
+1	i ' [ want offend anyone , i laugh reviews criticizing product working well first time do not understand meaning 'take n toss ' ? they 're meant use one time , toss they go everywhere daughter i i love 're disposable i n't lug around dirty sippy day they 're cheap enough i bought sets get summer i 'd highly recommend 
+1	does great job not spilling keep good flow milk/water toddler 's mouth we 've cups would take much end overflowing mouth work great it spills really full left horinzontal , little bit comes regular opening great price 
+1	cute , cheap work ! the thing baby would drink ( bottles , sippy cups ) can go dishwasher used - durable but lose one ok super cheap replace 
+1	first , not cup parent child throws cups pulls lids flips cups upside shakes regular basis if want one need get cup valve 's closer bottle however need cup wo n't make huge mess knocked right cups you these nice cups kids transitioning regular cups older kids situations regular cup would inconvenient i used years daughter transitioned regular cup situations spilled drink would disaster , cup beside bed night , cup i put juice sick trips car they 're cheap stack back cabinet pull need them the cups dishwasher safe , crack chewed besides 're fairly strong something disposable 
-1	my son 10 months old ca n't use seat 's not enough space seat tray he 's not fat child , either , 50th % cuts right belly i 'll returning today 
-1	we bought without really taking time research rush summer needed booster use relatives house n't one i wish i read reviews first , i would bought `` go '' booster instead oh well , 's beauty heindsight i guess : -pthis seat serves 's purpose pros : hard plastic seat tray easy cleanstraps , assembled fastened , stay tighttray removablefolds storagegood light use , i would n't use everyday- read cons 'll understandcons : tray hard remove , grasp pull sides just so get pop ( i struggle stiffle array 4-letter words quite often trying take tray ) it 's cumbersum set fold 'll need hands ( use `` on-the-go '' booster mother-in-law 's i open one hand , plop daughter seat , strap , strap booster seat chair easily ) first need untangle straps , make sure 're going coming right places , then put toddler first attach booster seat next vice versa the removable tray nice , , struggle take often not to fold back , 'll need hands push buttons either side seat pop seat fold , put tray rest , spend another minute two `` organizing '' straps n't get tangled come apart seat ( even straps `` assembled '' going right places , fall back 're not really careful ) this seat n't bad us , use relatives houses n't booster seat , 's not much hassle ( it 's used half dozen times past year ) but i would n't recommend 're going use month the removable tray nice , easy clean , hassle removing tray , use 2 hands set fold back , straps fall way easily not fastened , 's much hassle everyday use if need booster use often , i 'd recommend `` on-the-go '' booster seat 
+1	love seat ! wish reclining mode , think theres way would travel handy little package ! love straps wind , seat completely folds , lid snaps ! cool ! travels nicely ! definitely recommend product ! 
+1	when i expecting 3rd child , children 18 months , 4 years old i needed pass toddlers highchair baby this saftey first seat excellent ! features * the straps attatch booster chair roll underneath booster seat * a handle carry chair folded* a place hook tray seat folded* optional legs different hights* a very small compartment , usually keep bibster ( very hard fit though ! ) * a lap belt keeps son chair * a removable tray , one ( nothing loose ! ) it doesnt adjust , baby longer fits tray , probably old enough use booster underneath table ( like 2 year old ) i really not complaints , chair sturdy , fit nearly every chair use , great travel , son really doesnt want sit `` baby '' seats restaurants , i not like boosters without straps chair provide may start getting often ! 
+1	this product easy use required little effort the instructions clear helpful ( i noticed review woman rolled dough thin , directions clearly say not maybe altered directions help alleviate problems since purchased ) i enough left make handprint i happy : ) i glad keepsake baby 's adorable little foot 
+1	my husband bought he loved idea putting baby 's picture next foot hand print he thought would really neat look back picture 6 weeks see small tiny little feet hands it easy the material really easy work it easy get baby 's foot hand it n't goopy bring material baby instead trying balancing act getting baby positioned material trying hold still put stuff this package grabbed appendage wanted imprint , put material foot/hand pressed gently the frame easy put together caste dry the set background pink one side blue it really n't get easier really attractive put together the problem i caste cracked drying not much , enough noticeable ( this husband n't lay exactly flat dry , not fault product ) however , i filled crack caulk it worked great i would recommend anyone wants special keepsake child anyone buying gift expectant parent 
+1	great gift ! it easy follow direction the molding material easy work it n't dry quickly 're plenty time try 
-1	i think material mold especially entire frame somewhat cheap i know couple people 've happy product n't work us it tough squirmy baby finally get mold contrast n't striking -- footprint ink may look better not worth effort $ , opinion 
+1	i checked many baby foot print frames one far best quality easiest use the plaster quick set , easy looks good finished product the frame high qulity great clean lines this great product hard find stores i two ! love ! ( i even knocked one wall accident n't break - good quality , not cheap ! ) 
+1	i gave eddie bauer backpack diaper bag five stars simply wonderful ! i spotting bag store sometime broke bought i glad i it good short trips grocery store , visiting friends & family , shopping mall i easily pack two bottles small cooler type bag , plenty diapers ( i take 6 diapers ) compact container wipes , i also put several outfits zipper part ( you never know little one going mess clothes ) son 's bib i lotion baby oil side pockets everything fits perfectly bag i also put keys wallet zipper section also i still plenty room this diaper bag however not long trip , perfect short trips i love backpack style compact works great i hated taking bigger diaper us going gone couple hours bulky i n't need much stuff anyway i think price reasonable well worth trust use time wonder diaper bags i would rather use diaper bag two i i would highly reccommend backpack style diaper bag everyone ! my son 2 1/2 months old i carry everything needs bag try diaper backpack one time hooked like ! ! ! ! 
-1	it great looking backpack works need go somewhere short period time it n't hold much top n't close like think 
+1	i purchased soothing dreams monitor sound quality bad i took back this monitor n't neat features soothing dreams , something n't - works ! the sound quality wonderful you hear faintest noise baby 's room , keep volume see lights this monitor really best far sound quality goes , low price definitely bonus ! do n't waste money monitor frills n't work well - need ! ! ! 
+1	this monitor wonderful we get clear reception time there annoying static humming like many monitors best one affordable monitors market talk getting lot bang buck the monitor noise indicator lights , ca n't hear monitor ( ie volume turned , 're vaccuming ) see baby fussing 
-1	this monitor worked great first week then , much static i could n't sleep , i could n't hear baby clearly i highly recommend sony babycall monitor ( also carried babies r us , not online ) it wonderful voice activated feature allows perfect silence monitor unless baby fussing ( i e , wo n't hear vacuum cleaner dryer neighbor 's dog barking , etc - turns baby cries spouse talks , etc ) i bought sony retired fisher price sleeping better i weeks 
+1	i purchased different monitor , ended exchanging puchasing monitor the clairty good 's baby room the price also unbeatable i highly recommend monitor 
+1	we got one shower gift it nice everything need i like hard case durable i really like finger nail clippers best we use brush comb lot also i think reasonably price everything need 
-1	the nail clippers , hairbrush , comb great i not care rest it would cost effective buy items seperately company 
+1	i agree many reviews outlet plugs manage keep babies adults accessing outlets pretty effectively , i bought it seems two types outlet plugs available point : babies figure little time ( easy parents remove ) keep babies ( yet give parents trouble well ) i lupus even middle flare , hands weak stiff , i still get plugs even though requires good deal effort they give confidence though baby safe -- 's 8 months , active i 'm sure would figure plugs time so far , seen , touched , lost interest pretty quickly i say , though , i access outlets placed higher wall i use vacuuming , kitchen appliances , etc tried minimize need take plugs high-use outlets 
+1	i switched basic plastic covers son learned pull easily these require two hands wiggling back forth get : n't pull straight out there 's way son ( kid ! ) going get , 's purpose to keep safe i 'm willing spend extra 10 seconds little minor effort pull keep way 
-1	they work alright , no one use outlet , not even they impodsible remove i use pointed tool one hand squeezing three buttons simultaneously hand sounds easy huh ? do n't buy 
+1	these things bomb ( almost adult ) proof ! and , 're ones i 've found work plugs rectangular openings face plate 
+1	the basic covers not cut they tough remove , point we feel much safer 
+1	yes , things work no baby get thing , outlets n't 100 % sturdy ( i e loose sockets ) , adults tough time ( tightly stick ) your best bet alternate : use baby 's primary play area choose user-friendly model places plug ( the simple ones without release buttons ) this works us 
+1	unobtrusive , toddler n't figured yet -- ca n't argue they bit tricky get , require enough force outlets n't solidly mounted , 'll move they job , i much prefer thesafe plate electric outlet - bulk 25 pack - white single screw i used safe plates would n't fit ( double gangs , instance ) 
-1	we tried todder started able pull simpler socket protectors first , would n't go sockets sometimes 'd work one socket pair , not , i n't htink user error problem fixture second , 2 year old able figure mechanism strong enough pull within 20 minutes 
+1	these heavy-duty plug covers , good thing i twin boys see everything interesting challenge , yet ca n't get covers outlet sure , take couple moments us adults remove , benefit outweighs silly impatience one might feel wiggling cover these much better old style plug covers , daughter used pluck right outlet put mouth 
+1	pro : i feel confident child not able remove thesecon : we hard time removing need use outlets it definitely takes two hands push top button squeeze sides time 
-1	these plugs actually really difficult open i end pulling outlet sockets anyways 
+1	i love outlet plugs we cheaper ones company n't press put outlet 18 month old daughter able pull right so decided try let tell things hard get wall , even but 's good thing opinion i would rather something difficult get i even take moments something daughter going pull possibly end hurting herself pros : +hard pull wall+easy install+works standard outletcons : -hard pull wall even adult-a bit pricey need lot outlets 
+1	i purchased reading reviews hard remove i not surprised hard remove - lol you need figure take find gadget help depress safety - screw driver works well us we bought two types , put areas son lot access , outlets dont use much we used cheaper , easier remove style outlets 
+1	these not easy remove actually , nuisance decide want use outlet however , need n't take much curious dexterous child figure remove styles plugs i three kinds house , far favorite there way going able remove ! 
-1	you push sides remove , every single one pack one side already jammed would n't move pushing sides n't move latch enough cover come , need wrestle get not good back already leaning this they good idea badly made 
+1	these hard use - get , even adults , looking we 'll see little girl gets interested outlets 
-1	i bought based great reviews put outet well , problem i could n't remove ! i followed directions luck my husband mess 10 minutes pry i guess good keeping child outet , not practical ever plan using outlet i sent back ! 
+1	my daughter kind plug pry fingernail plug fixture get darned thing i soft fingernails 's really hard i want use outlet house i got house much easier use all squeeze sides push top button pull right it 's great stick little wall get much better grip n't use fingernails pry however , would challenge baby get probably could n't squeeze sides push button time i 'm happy purchase i 57 year old grandma i anyone 
+1	some negative reviews turned product i decided buy anyways i could n't find sliding plate cover gfci outlets i n't want child see us removing easier outlet safety plugs regular basis i think product must improved ones i bought pushed one side work exactly per instructions basically , pushing left button unlocks top button pushing top button unlocks latch ground hole with top button continually depressed , need patiently rock plug comes it 's particularly frustrating 're rush otherwise tired first pull two little noticeable progress personally i feel tight fit sign good design certain frustrate even toddlers good coordination after weeks regular use , husband remove one hand single pull the best part looks like 's tugging plug little one unlikely catch onto required button sequence too bad cost much ( relative plain plugs ) i 'd consider using everywhere since fairly low profile thus inconspicuous the size grip product might make difficult people large hands lack coordination/strength fingers/hands 
-1	after reading reviews i hoping would keep little one safe however , even i followed directions , plugs would fall right outlet/socket prompting all i return thankfully amazon great return policy 
+1	i n't think every hospital gives away things the hospital i delivered gave nasal aspirator terms tools take home so gadgets still help , especially nail clippers , files , hair brush i disagree baby 's nails soft peel - would mean would wait gets long peel - i n't want risk baby scratching long nails getting hang nail long actually near nail might tear deep bleed i agree nail clipper could little smaller still works great products ! 
-1	first bulb syringe 's too hard , worst : not suck ( blue one hospital life saver ) the brush rough baby 2 , comb i started use daughter 3 months old , rough newborn the nail clipper big daughter little the comb 's ok the nail fillers way too rough the dropper too big i regret spending money keep searching another set ! ! ! ! update -- - > i 'm writing note reading comment year i say i wrote review stating items n't work newborn promise , items use older baby i say nail clipper best one ever since daughter 15 months old , husband step broke i run store bought another one : lucky i found smaller set scisors nail fillers i n't buy whole kit ! !

+1	contrary another reviewer said i not get things baby care items i left hospital baby so came handy the items i really use nail clippers , thermometer baby brush because nail clippers big hand i n't drop easily i would regular small ones baby hits hand they nice sharp also i n't found need way top able swival though everything pretty standard not low quality i feared the brush like typical baby doll brush ( soft fine ) n't help getting cradle cap scales well the tub thermometer ok , rather hard read underwater the carrying case clear zippered i found handy since i could see glance missing i think i would prefered buy items individually money , n't much spend would good 
+1	didnt know pink option blue still looks nice baby girl it basics make first time mom-to-be feel little better bringing baby home hospital i love brush , soft fact fits case nice organized hope keep like ! 
-1	i got baby shower disappointed i opened i know clippers thermometer necessities , excited see kit came us however , i opened i realized clippers thermometer cheaply made , therefore i purchase separately everything else `` fluff '' n't really need most get hospital syringe comes medicines buy save money buy clippers thermometer separately n't worry rest n't need 'll get hospital 
+1	i n't used yet , seems really complete full everything need i liked better others i saw 
-1	this useful things not enough merit purchase get nosefreida instead bulb thing , get baby nail scissors instead clippers , teething tablets recalled i ca n't get medicine-dispensing pacifier open put medicine also syringe tip large fit opening pain reliever doling pain markings rub syringe making useless uses i n't use teething toy i think thing i actually use thermometer in end , 's easier purchase things need separately this n't anything magical would overlook baby snotty nose , clean ; baby fever/pain , relieve , etc 
+1	after product 8 months daughter 's life i 'd say i used still use every product except medicine syringe , n't contain enough suction hold medicine the case bulky really diaper bag , i never needed products go , get lot use changing station i 'm pleased kit overall would say 11 12 products use i 'd rate 5 stars nevertheless 
+1	i love kit everything kit necessity works well my complaint nail clippers they bit big use newborn oh , i wish i knew hospital lady went received products i got diapers formula bag i sneak t-shirt blanket memories ! ! 
+1	rest items ! i ca n't seem get enough suction aspirator work it everything need , carrying case n't bulky it really good investment ! 
-1	the thing i use kit hair brush the nail files okay the medicine dropper useless it would n't suction medicine the fingernail clipper also useless it 's adult-sized one attachment should gotten baby-specific -sized one even though right i 'm trying file nails rather clip ( pediatrician 's advice ) i 'm using nasal aspirators took hospital , i 'm told best so , , i , i 'd buy pieces one-by-one rather kit since i n't used much , parts i used , mostly unimpressed 
+1	not kits include scissor , digital thermometer , tweezer etc this one the compact pouch securely holds everything place great traveling great value ! 
+1	it 's awhile since last review i thought i 'd share opinion while hospitals may ( ) give items kit , 's not guarantee 's nothing wrong backup i actually 2 kits , one house one diaper bag 
-1	i n't think able use items they al feel cheap the bulb syringe not even work 
+1	extend life avent 's product they fit avent cups bottles also , help daughter lear drink independently 
-1	they great product child takes trainer set , wise , inquisitive children get distracted , specially color choices instead making clear white 
+1	these great i would rather spend small amount money buying put avent bottles lot sippy cups they fit regular avent bottles easily they go dishwasher , son starting hold bottle loves he ca n't grasp entire bottle ideal what great idea combined spill teats catered go sports bottle cup love 
+1	so , let start review saying not able pick color annoying ( i bruiser boy & received 2 pink handles ) , least colors offered match avent label bottles , 's not big deal my boy finds handles really easy use we owned 2 avent bottles ( bottles exclusively breastfeeds ) & doctor encouraged starting sippy cups little bit water ( 6months ) , i really n't want bottles go waste i thrilled avent offers handles ( & non spill soft spouts ) the handles perfect little hands & giving consumer option modify already ingenious 
+1	i really like i using convert daughter 's avent 4 oz bottles sippy cups perfect inexpensive accessory save price sippys she 11 months using since 6 months i would given 5 star rating i could pick colors i got two green ones , fine , wish i choice ! 
+1	personally love avent items ! son learning hold bottle helping much ! 
+1	i know thing dimensions , course 's going small holds 2x3 frame even though i see dimensions i ca n't see head arrives , thing itty bitty maybe great cramped desk space , really nice , super cute ! 
+1	i move lot making sure frames durable paramount this frame well made n't sustain damage dog nose knocked onto tile table top 
+1	frame cute real weight , n't feel look cheap note used verticle pictures images sides set vericle 
+1	when i say its experience i two twins , 8 mnt b b 3 year old b/g my older twins regular diaper genie , let tell thing worst ! ! when i heard `` new imporved '' diaper genie , i decided give shot wow i hated one two , woulda guessed ? i dont know anyone would enjoy turning knob fifty times get new bag , one handed , kidding ? okay one history there 2 others i looking , diaper champ , neat diaper disposal system , yes one wasnt mind yet my friend one 10 month old champ stinks but since really doesnt know others i told pails sucked , i would get one well neat , didnt buy , saw friends house hated champ , well hates neat 3 month old 18 month old so i didnt know i leaning toward champ stunk , atleast one didnt need refils well bru disposal system i didnt see , low behold the dekor plus ! i told husband ones stunk , lets try one , could say tried ! well , occasional 3 year old pull ups , 2x dirty 8 month old diapers i love it ! this thing nifty it really keeps smell bay , course empty i keep one circular deoderant things attatched ( sometimes 2 ! ) i spray lysol i clean , every 2 weeks and when i empty smell worse regular dirty diaper smell well i sometimes get little whift boys room , i just change the bag ! duhh , starts smell change often i sorry diapers stink i found diaper dekor best my friends k o champ wished away diaper genies hey think get champ dont need buy many refils , well guess , that means stinky nursery alot garbage bags these refils last months i love soo much i think i may get one downstairs ! dont waste money others , save little get one , only one works**** wow i read review targets website diaper genie they said dispose # 2 waste diaper toilet , not whole diaper wipe , `` # 2 '' it eliminates almost odors i definatly trying ( and # 2 diapers really cant , wet diapers , wont unbearable ) a great idea ! ! 
-1	i bought product reviews i read however does not keep smell dirty diapers i used 7 months go buy different one if like , want products buy intended job this not want get diaper champ use regular trash put way ( extra bathroom , laundry room , etc ) 
+1	i bought child 's nursery he 3 months old second bag ( used one came diaper pail 2 months ) so far , odors the bags light scent may help odor control i love i not feel like i wasting bags i cut bags make new one full diapers get smelly introduce solid food , i cut bags take sooner i usually take 1 bag week ( full ! ) they fit lot diapers inside i recently purchased second diaper dekor plus downstairs regular trash starting smell bit i absolutely love diaper pail recommend ! ! 
+1	the diaper dekor excellent job well my newborn 's diapers easily drop dekor step pedal once dekor full , bag easily removed cut right length means bag wasted the bag nice scent n't overpowering the bags proven durable strong support weight diapers my nursery smell free diaper odor dekor plus diaper system my complaint would i wish bigger ( 's smaller standard trash ) 
+1	i using diaper pail dekor 8 months i love i tried others via girlfriends , none seem easy use works well the foot pedal design open lid sold ( 're hands busy enough ! ) although heavier lift due sealing around edge lid , gets job done better anything use hands , i never problem getting dirty diaper pail due the seal worth ! the diapers drop another door automatically opens drop diaper , closes back 's self the liner bags well designed tie bag bottom , simply fill diapers would regular trash bag ( crazy long diaper sausage ! ) the bottom opens 're ready change bag it small `` razor edge '' ( well protected injury ) inside door slice bag however full tie bottom , 're set ! ( sounds harder complicated really ) i hesitated thought buy replacement bags i bought two boxes daughter born , 8 months old , i still not buy boxes yet ! not costly i thought especailly convienence ! ! smell well , really good job smells as know , baby 's diet changes , smell diapers ! i 'd say , i n't smell thing 6-7 months old introduction solids of course , i would n't want think 'd without dekor ! i research buying diaper pail , comparision test top selling diaper pails , one winner especailly smell factor ! regular cleaning lysoling helps keep pail fresh possible i reccomend pail friends personal experience , reviews word mouth best way gather research quest perfect baby products ! 
+1	the diaper dekor best the refills last forever , totally simple use really not smell we dump diapers week , literally smell within time after using diaper pails older kids , i highly recommend one 
-1	i bought product based reviews i read year ago my daughter 11 months old entire room stinks whenever dispose soiled diaper ! i change bag every time bm i finally gave bought another diaper genie i one first two children may hassle use i not recall omitting much odor diaper dekor plus save money , n't buy product ! 
+1	i happy find diaper disposal system worked well cloth diapers it usually fills i ready diaper laundry , great capacity we used disposable liners came i ran , used re-usable cloth liners i purchased separately both easy use , helped keep nursery stink-free if go back forth cloth disposable , plan one , great option , use easily options , opposed munchkin diaper genie , much harder use cloth 
+1	we purchased nursery honestly , i originally wanted one looked nicer pails , white grey went nursery however , 've using 6 months , i really love function is pros : -no smell i empty thing maybe week ( sometimes longer i 'm lazy ) i never smell dirty diapers we eating solids , baby know i 'm talking about -easy empty i love i open bottom , pull bag , cut , new bag already loaded waiting the bags also hold lot diapers i n't counted , i ca n't tell exactly many , like i mentioned , i empty week -locking lid there 's lock lid prevent little hands getting trash our baby 6 months i n't worry yet , 's crawling everything , i 'm sure 's not far off -looks nice it really look like nice diaper pail also , narrow width makes perfect fit dresser/changing table wall -refills last forever the refills pricier others , i 'm sure , last forever i 've replaced bag around 3-4 months cons : -no indicator bag refill close end roll this really complaint i think i read review somewhere suggested putting pink line marker refill bags know 's almost it n't caused problems yet , would helpful know i 'm almost bag -the lid sticks sometimes , n't close way i 'm not sure 's sitting plush carpet not hard surface , lid n't always fully shut not big deal 's second lid underneath covers diapers , 's annoyance i realize i 'm picky , i needed least two cons , right ? overall , really great diaper pail i 've recommended pregnant friends 
+1	the title says , absolutely best diaper diposal system tried tried the best thing hardly smell liners come last long time , not buy refills already used 6 months holds smell well enough nothing going cover perfectly , adding bounce dryer sheet helps best thing empty trash comes every week i love fact emptying hardly smell anything open hurry cut tie bag smell comes price baby becomes older learn open top drop stuff didnt last long son , times all definately recommend 
+1	my son 3 months old , therefore still baby poop phase , not yet odor issues system the changing station use often one attaches pack play bedroom , disposal system bedroom time i never , even 's fullest , noticed smell , husband likened bloodhound ridiculously sensitive sense smell bear mind though , son not yet solids , poop still glorified bile i update review months really stinky diapers the time smell tying bag 's full , 's whole system open 're smelling old poop couple days ago that expected it holds lot , empty twice week , refill cartridges last ages ! we used 3 months , 8 9 diapers day ( since son incredible knack pooping , change ) half way second cartridge total like reviewers , i would say could putting red strip end refill let know 're need put new one , 'd always next one ready go anyway the door latch n't strong , door open ajar bag quite full bulging , , 'd changing point anyway , would allow door close properly again it 's good price the refills not expensive , especially long last i 'd definitely get again edit : my son 7 months old well truly solids stinky poop goes the system also 7 months old , springs latches seem strong begin sadly , bit odor system , i tend keep hallway instead changing station room , smell n't enclosed one small room time out , i honestly n't smell unless i 'm right close , n't feel need hide guests over i absolutely stand 4 stars it good system , i would purchase you really need remember systems , always degree smell leakage diaper disposal system my best advice change bag every 2-3 days , clean lysol week still satisfied customer ! 
+1	the biggest problem smell escapes diaper bin there simply way around it might not bad bin closed , bag changing time comes , 'll foul odor one way mitigate use munchkin nursery fresheners form deodorant/baking soda place bottom bin i use two help odors coming bag container i would not use diaper pail room bathroom , smell captured gotten rid ventilation pros : - it large frequent bag cycles needed- offers flexibility frequent infrequent bag `` changes '' without wasting plastic - offers convenient foot pedal open lid- has attractive look especially many offered colors- does not require diaper pushed - diaper soiled enough heavy fall itselfcons : - because large diapers fall hard judge much diapers a lot diapers mean lot smell , bag pretty heavy- mediocre containing odors coming diapers ; especially evident bag cycle times comes 
+1	i love diaper dekor plus its convinent twins almost 20 months old still use , late bloomers 27 % height weight we also use 8 week olds dirty diapers , yuck ! pros-* nice big , hold many diapers* really one handed , cool easy* no smells , not not ever ! * bag refils inexpensive last months* looks cute decales lol* my sons yet figure open it* we keep deoderizer , keeps fresh* very easy change bag thats time get whif , change every 4 days so* bags sold bru , target , walmart , easy find* holds many diapers pull-ups , sons soon using them* you really occasionally scrub soap watercons-*refils , would perfect didnt need special refils , actually means , like another reviewer said , alot garbage bags* it would nice refils changed colors near end , funny realize refils left , need loli would recomend others , friends got rid thier champs bought , expensive reason 
+1	ca n't speak ability diaper trashcan contain smells since still breastfeeding design awesome ! husband love one continuous trashbag feel like n't waste space since essentially making size bag definitely recommend trashcan ! 
+1	this first diaper pail i wanted get used cloth diapers first 8 months i needed one could used wet dry so i bought diaper champ while i using champ wasnt much odor , course i washing diapers every day wasnt much chance odor build however stopped using cloth switched disposables smell awful ! there two problems champ , one 's top heavy tips easily two hole near handle odor always seeping through the diaper dekor plus solved issues its compact yet holds ammount diapers `` champ '' its size top bottom chance tipping there also exposed holes allow odor escape on inside door bottom `` cutting tool '' isnt exposed use cut bag tie simpleusing dekor easy well handles twist turn dont even use hands all step peddel lid pops ( like regular trash ) drop diaper i admit im lazy try cram `` one '' diaper dekor small odor escapes im pushing diaper however 's nowhere near stench `` champ '' had my daughter year i couldnt pleased if using disposables i highly reccomend dekor plus i mine month yet change bag i concerned i would spending lot money refills far hasnt case now daughters room odor except sweet smell update : i two months , i change bag week i still havent put new refill ! i bought box month ago thinking would anyday still hasnt run ! also refills come boxes 3 one lasts least two months looking buying refills twice year ! awesome ! ! ! ! 
+1	this pail not good disposable diapers cloth diapers well ! it 's great n't require special type bag you put regular trash bag want buy refill bags i use pail liner cloth diapers it great job keeping smells the time i notice smell i 'm opening throw diaper change pail liner i like product much i recommend anyone i know 's baby whether using disposables cloth diapers ! 
+1	i n't smell anything unless i toss diaper , i tell 's made good quality too i like diapers pile like regular trash bag not sausage link diaper genie it seems like , fit diapers it i glad i made purchase , hubby loves , i love , i highly recommend ! 
+1	my daughter 2-1/2 years old using diaper dekor since born it wonderful baby it easy dispose diapers , step pedal drop the diaper pails adjust , hard enough keep squirming baby table i never problem smelling the complaint i daughter toddler , loves lift lid dekor reach take dirty diapers so use dekor trash bathroom ( works great ) use regular trash diapers i expecting another child i researched pails , even though toddler proof , i think i stick dekor i ca n't imagine trying wrestle diaper pail two children 
-1	mine broke first week i ( one inner flap 's spring broke ) it not contain odors well however , i like foot pedal opening hold lot diapers i feel like i would better regular trash lid though 
+1	i looking pale would keep smell biodegradable gdiapers bay i saw biodegradable refills , i decided try it definitely helps smell before , i emptying lidded garbage day i week i keep box baking soda bottom absorb odor well it really seems help the major selling points were:1 biodegradable refills2 double barrier lid ( flip-up lid another trap door type lid ) 3 lockable lid ( knob turns lock trap door toddlers ca n't throw random items fish yuck ! ) 4 smooth open close via foot pedali 'm happy purchase it 's easy use , keeps odor actually save money long run , since i n't buy ton biodegradable garbage bags need replacing day 
+1	we changing table bedroom diaper dekor right beside for first year really n't oder but got older `` stuff '' got stronger , tend get wiff walk ( that tells us 's time change bag , times 's pretty full start notice smell , pretty much needs changed anyway ) as long change bags 's time weekly garbage pickup fine getting fresh bag quick easy you use system one hand i highly recommend the downfall i n't seen refills local walmart target nearest babies r us 45 minutes away order online but bags last long time i baby december 2005 i still using original bags came february 2006 despite lack availability refills i would buy product well worth money 
+1	we 've using diaper dekor plus since baby born eight months ago i happy product i n't notice smell i sensitive sniffer it 's easy use the improvement i could think designed inside flaps open press foot pedal opens lid this would good starts get half way full push diaper rather drop that , , made taller inner flaps would space go tip - roll dirty diaper fold sides using velcro secure , make little `` package '' easily drops diaper dekor allows diapers fit inside 
+1	ok , i diaper genie pail well i used use regular wet diapers , genie poopy diapers , worked fine -until baby old enough start messing trash at point , i needed locked pail , bought wet diapers it worked great purpose then second baby born i started using young babies diapers again , not bad , not work well genie however , big `` pro '' pail not have buy refills i actually buy refills couple times , came hate run would n't always obviously `` stop '' like genie one occasion i went empty pail find collapsed bag bunch loose dirty diapers inside boy make mad now , i simply use cheap 13 gallon kitchen size trash bags ( medium size would work also i believe ) 's easy fit pail tuck around top ridge wo n't collapse 's cheaper using genie replacements ( holds genie ) in summary , buy one pail , genie still best , suck cost refills this makes great secondary pail wet diapers i might also buy second this pail keep downstairs diapers change , ensure dogs n't get trash happened time two this good `` light use '' pail flexible bag options , i give 4 stars 
+1	i live trailer super tiny rooms this pail life saver since i 'm stay home mom poops go never tell 's poop tiny room keeps smell well ! just hold breath go throw another fast ! when husband takes trash night apologizes deal smell i let think i dealt smell day really baby 's room always clean fresh smelling ! just tip : small rooms n't want bad smell room , take pail else even outside tie bag the pail super lightweight bags last ! 
-1	i received item baby shower ( 11/03 ) still the doors keep falling , fills fast my daughter 's everything learned open top remove diapers she know door n't close falls apart , 's always plastic bag we put kidco locks top keep top opening another lock door , would open , would come 's holders sure nice pail keep diapers gone but , stinky diapers , stinks room i put air freshners inside help odor not great pail , n't cost cheap , 's made cheap 
+1	i use re-usable cloth diapering dekor bags wonderful if n't already added baby registry do it ! love low profile aesthetic well ! 
+1	i 've using pail 1 month wonderful we going buy another one upper floor it contains odor really well ( i realize breasted newborns n't stink ) the pail looks great , i bought sage color it really easy use , need one hand necessary great buy ! 
+1	when i went shopping diaper pail , i research i not want pail complicated smelly this diaper pail wonderful ! in months , never problem smell it fits many diapers well -- i find change every 4-5 days the refill pack comes three refills refill lasts us 2 months there complicated stuffing twisting like diaper pails ( i heard friends not work well keeping smell nursery -- ie diaper champ diaper genie ) using simple pressing foot pedal dropping diaper i admit pail gets little full , tend pack diapers bags last longer , i never problem getting anything hands the issue i i carpet , difficult use foot pedal ( wants sink carpet ) but i simply lift lid drop diaper -- problems ! it nice looking well -- not look like diaper pail , could used garbage future ( top diaper drop part comes used reason ) the refills also easy use -- open lid , drop one , pull bag tie knot very simple i would recommend diaper pail anyone ! 
+1	this third diaper pail i purchased little year i say , i think favorite far both others i purchased not worth money either not easily cleaned , not block enough smell ! this one better combination i like lever bottom step dont even touch anything n't want it also nice really chance making mess , top opens goes right bag the refills last forever i also feel like bags take fill you cram lot 's time cut bag tie i would definitely recommend rest pails ! 
+1	i diaper pail 2 1/2 years , i recieved first sons baby shower i actually registered diaper genie , dissapointed i got one after knowing many moms genie , i happy someone purchased one instead ! it holds ton diapers pull-ups ! my 4 month olds diapers dont stink much yet , pail handle job ! honestly , i think i onlyo stinky nursery i stuffed bags , didnt clean pail , didnt keep deoderant circles i find unnessesary `` dump '' `` # 2 '' toilet first , pail handles job it easy dump diaper one handed , refils last months , litteraly ! i bought refils days ago , ones i since second son came home hospital , four months ago ! my 2 1/2 year old not figure open though ( thank goodness ! ) not potty trained , soon ! this tackels odors refils really arent expensive i love , house guests amazed i actually change diapers house , not one whiff ! 
-1	i pretty excited i ordered diaper , seemed like good concept , i n't want diaper genie it good idea , unfortunately n't play well reality the plastic absorbed odors dirty wet diapers , , even empty smells bad it left daughter 's room dirty diaper smell in order attempt solve issue without getting rid i scrubbed empty bleach odor eliminator , sprinkled baking soda bottom new bag bought arm hammer diaper trash bags tie individual dirty dirty diaper throwing away dekor hopefully help stink 
+1	our oldest 3 , diaper pail job , right next bed entire time ( containing stinky diapers younger son past 19 months ) in light 600 reviews product , i 'll boil four points : ( 1 ) it really contain smell , despite simplicity i sensitive nose , time i catch odor within i purposely hold two flap doors open take whiff , i 'm changing bag compacting full one knee squeeze air ( definitely outside task -- stinky ! ) ( 2 ) price bags hand , others pointed , 're real expense time ( 3 ) our secondary flapper door hanging open past weeks , probably result loose spring affected corrosion ( air stays moist inside pail ) i shopped around repair kit came empty , emailed company they quickly -- gratis -- sent replacement flapper door easily snapped place problem solved ( 4 ) it 's pretty durable our oldest regularly climbs sits -- says 's rocket he n't managed break anything , despite conventional construction ( i e lightweight , not overbuilt , though i hesitate call flimsy ) 
+1	this must have ! ! ! ! we diaper genie children i must say diaper dekor much better product it 's easier put diapers , easier change refill easier dispose used diapers we like much better there fiddling around spinning top like diaper genie you step foot pedal open top drop diaper you even holding baby it also controls odor well our 11 year-old handles taking trash not problem handling diaper dekor we would definitely recommend product plan buy gift expecting friends 
+1	this diaper pail great hold lot diapers great little flap keeps diaper smell trapped away i totally recommend product 
+1	we 've dekor 8 months pleased it 's easy use , looks good , mostly keeps stinky diaper smell nursery i mean , bag full poopy diapers i think matter trashcan use stink going get but i love dekor bags cut wherever want toss trash without feeling like 're wasting bag one thing could made better , though , lid swing way open 're changing bag cartridge 
-1	i using diaper pail 7 weeks , i hate i two boys diapers - one turn 2 , 7 weeks old the pail tiny , i change bag daily when gets half full , top wo n't close , letting poop odors because second inner door flap goes inwards , prevents able fill bag completely runs diapers this also causes inner door flap get little gross the pail insanely expensive , refills i started using bags , pain put take i really expected disappointed ! i 'm glad gift - i wo n't feel too bad i toss ! 
+1	we 7 1/2 months using last bag first refill pack no issues odor use it 's easier diaper genie n't touch throw away diaper , 's foot pedal 
+1	i picked reviews i not disappointed ! i love pail there not stink , super easy use half awake , emptying easy pie 
+1	plus:1 easy use the foot pedal works great cutting edge bags really convenient 2 good odor control 3 liners really last long time , making less expensive seem first- definitely cheaper genie 's even regular trash bags cost something 4 the style ( foot pedal controlled flip-up top trap doors ) makes impossible puppy get , dog expert trash cans he n't even made move , says something impressive odor control 5 holds lot diapers- empty every 5 days minus:1 it 's nearly impossible find refill liners stores ( i 've seen baby depot , never brs , target , walmart , anywhere else ) need ordered ahead time , means always pay shipping well 2 a minor point , hard tell liner run so long 've ordered extras ahead time , n't big deal , n't , 're trouble couple days 
+1	having never used another diaper pail , i ca n't compare product but i say i totally happy pail i find easy use , contains odors , easy empty refill , looks fairly modern yet not eyesore it also seems hold fair number diapers we empty week even less , also tend stuff top ! sometimes i noticed odor i go put another diaper , almost always 's full i 'm literally shoving another one , therefore allowing time odors escape ! when 's closed , odors my son 6 months starting solids , see smell still contained poops really start stinking : - ) agree though one reviewer would nice got heads bag inside almost ( like changing color something ) 
+1	when i babysat 10+ years ago junior high i always got confused diaper genie , simple easy use i find $ 10- $ 15 overpriced amazon compared babies'r'us buy buy baby this product held well 8 months 've used keeps room not smelling 
+1	as first time mom i pleasantly surprised find diaper pail actually works ! so many friends tried diaper genie others claimed diaper disposal system really keeps smell works well i found claims diaper dekor makes true it easy dispose bag full diaper odor daughter 's nursery so nice find product delivers claims 
+1	this diaper pail great ! i read reviews would like comment based them our son 5 months old week he exclusively breastfed , formula added diet , also eats jarred foods regardless eats `` output '' , long close diaper way , pail holds odors well diaper disposal system does i personally think design ingenious ! the liner sets top pail pull bottom make knot bottom to dispose diapers , step pedal the top lifts , drop diaper , falls `` flaps '' when 's full , open door front cut liner ( liner-cutter door ) you totally control much liner use therefore n't waste huge portion liner unfilled then tie new knot pull liner fill pail , 're ready start ! the system comes one liner refill , refills sold 3 pack ( i see time babies 'r ' us , babies 'r ' us almost never anything stock ! ) we first refill first pack we bought 2 packs refills got system , i seriously wonder ever need purchase another one 'll even use bought ! one reviewer stated system tell bag run could tossing diaper pail w/out liner i 'm really not sure would ever happen , one open side pail remove full bag pull new liner if go pull liner hit end refill well , 's like saying n't know paper towel roll comes end you pull more someone also commented flaps , diapers n't fall i disagree regardless son 's age , long urinated diaper kind weight , would fall only completely dry would not fall and even , take foot pedal let top fall , would push anyway the one area i agree person , though , pail starts filling , really want maximize liner not change right away , do push top diaper get go far enough flaps close but i never touched another dirty diaper , i think 's still worth not reach lift push twist , like diaper genie there also comments refilling liner no , not simple dropping bag , like would regular trash but certainly not complicated there drawing shows , 's done , wo n't months also , change liner , so easy take top pieces apart clean i think 's easy keep system clean & sanitary all said , 're looking easiest possible route dispose dirty diapers , use regular garbabe take trash frequently ! if 're looking disposal system n't worry constantly getting dirty diapers house , i 'd really say one way go ! 
+1	i used diaper dekor 8 yrs ago first daughter purchased new little girl 's gotten better they 've made improvements make easier use clean would highly recommend keeps mess smell belongs 
+1	i personal recommendations diaper dekor , i read reviews decided get overall , i pleased it foot pedal open lid drop diaper trap doors the pedal not work exceptionally well plush carpet little firm support underneath , 's good enough you always put plywood pail pedal extra support also , dirty diaper , mess could get trap doors part diaper hits when full , pail easy empty open bottom compartment , pull plastic tube/bag dirty diapers , cut throw away then pull tube/bag , tie new knot pail ready fill the refills bit tricky replace first time , get hang , 's easy the refill bags last long time there three box 've used two boxes eight months there way knowing refill bag near end though , may not left enough hold diapers dirty diapers may loose pail this happened couple times 's not big deal clean it would nice plastic red stripe toward end like cash register receipt papaer , 'd know 's out this diaper pail not anything fancy diaper , roll sausage , roll want save space fit diapers pail when child eating solids though , probably want empty pail daily each time open lid put new dirty diaper , smell previously discarded diapers wafts room i 've tried adding baby powder baking soda bag help absorb odor i also got diaper pail deodorizers babies r us seem help mask smell

+1	i two faves i alternate two various reasons i pumping 100 % daughter not latch ( another story - issues losing > 10 % supliment bottle expressed milk - nipple confusion ) finding right pad put always sensitive nipples critical writing review both favesphilips avent disposable nursing padspros : - softer lansinoh- works really well nipples tender drying makes worse- regardless cream/balm i used , sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds not stick ( occasionally ) cons : - little bulkier lansinoh may show bras- i leaking stage ( i go little long night morning pumping session ) i occasionally leaked padlansinoh disposable nursing padspros : - thinner larger diameter avent- keeps nipples drier- i n't think i ever leaked throughcons : - not soft advent- sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds stick pad sometimes tear scabs ( sorry sounds gross , happens ) i usually use avent nipples bad shape ( seems go cycles ) softer wounds n't stick switch lansinoh healing need dry 
-1	i love avent products n't thinking made they way small way thick feels like maxi pad

-1	i n't like they small thick , show thru clothes i use instead evenflow , thin larger 
-1	these pads complete waste money i started usinglansinoh 20265 disposable nursing pads , 60-packwhich awesome ! but i hoping would work little cheaper they might work extremely light practically non-existent leakage but even case , absorbent material used product performs like thin circular cotton ball -- n't draw moisture away skin , extremely irritating skin made feel edgy damp time so cons product : -there waterproof backing pads ( good preventing thrush ) bad holding leaks my shirt bra would end damp anyway -the absorbent material not draw moisture away skin my skin would end wet damp hot very uncomfortable -i change pads constantly i wanted feel dry comfortable -- thus removing whole purpose replacing wonderful product -lansinoh pads- terrible cheaper product -the mesh material covered absorbent material irritating skin would stick skin i removed pad the mesh material also allowed fibers would stick skin would end rubbing baby 's face -these pads small puffy , would often show silhouette wearing even slightly fitted shirt -

+1	i normally sleep stomach needed supportive pillow adapt sleeping side now i little one i n't want stop using pillow i gotten used i recommend pregnant friends 
+1	i used since i first started & # 34 ; showing & # 34 ; could longer sleep belly which big deal i normally belly sleeper this made sleeping much easier i 33 weeks pregnant still loving pillow i wished i known first pregnancy 
+1	a friend bought pillow gift first pregnancy i 5 5 months second pregnancy , i consider absolute necessity i n't think i would bought seemed like much money spend specialized pillow huge pain store but -- i convinced essential sleeping pregnancy ! it much comfortable arrangement pillows , well worth price i credit pillow helping get sleep pregnancies my husband even likes -- uses i town ! it quite big bulky -- like another body bed there good way make bed pillow , 've given trying make bed look normal pillow it either gets moved floor bed made , pull covers looks like someone still sleeping bed oh well - it well worth 6-9 months pregnancy helps sleep !

+1	i pain hips early first trimester pillow miracle worker relieved pain allowed sleep comfortably i slept well pillow throughout pregnancy i hard time giving son born it also gave great support growing belly it rather large king sized bed n't issue us worth investment ! 
-1	way big , 's ridiculous hard sleep i would returned n't hassle return giant thing 
+1	i must say i could not even imagine number possible ways positions body pillow used currently second trimester i helps fix position tilted safe left side serves stopper i accidentally wo n't roll onto stomach even press way super thick , soft comfortable n't sink time ( using several months ) definitely recommend product cheaper maternity/motherhood store , even outlet ca n't find good deal amazon 
+1	i hardest time trying make sleep side i would wake every morning pain back this pillow helped lot i sleep long side back this way even i try roll i 'm not completely back the fabric not soft i put regular pillow case head rests i n't feel like pillow hard i would prefer little stuffing head area prop little , head comfortable throughout night i think biggest problem put end legs bring belly , n't much pillow lefts align hips , i sometimes wake sore hips i think helps put extra pillow legs the pillow large getting situated bed annoying also makes bit hard cuddle partner , i usually make sure loge side facing outside bed overall pillow really comfortable my boyfriend likes steal i 'll probably keep using even i 'm pregnant 
+1	7 months along , gets tougher finding ways sleep comfortably night pros : curved contoured neck legs supported also , allows flip side side without rearrange pillow would need regular body pillow cons : material pillow not softest improve sure that 's it works : ) 
-1	i told i ever got pregnant i would splurge pregnancy pillow ! well , i hated thing after 2 nights , i could not tolerate both mornings i woke-up sore neck not good way turn middle night covered sheet i actually , get bed , pull sheet back , flip pillow , hop back bed if pillow edge nearest side bed , good luck trying get middle night restroom break ! the leg support thing decent i decided not splurge ; i take 10 pillows day uncomfortable pillow ! 
+1	i 'm using pillow week 's i noticed i 'm 27 weeks belly not big , still caused lot trouble sleeping i spend 10 minutes every night getting comfortable enough pillows , course time i ( pretty much ) i 'd get go bathroom : ) i use snoogle pillow along 2 ( ! ) extra pillows help i 'll skip pros part reviewers good job describing but cons could definetely improved manufacturer:1 the seam goes way inside curve pillow stiff pillow stretched around body this uncomfortable i usually feel either shoulder , neck chest depending position i take it touching soft areas feels almost like cardboard across skin 2 the fabric pillow kind rough not pleasant skin face i thinking sewing case softer fabric , could little complicated odd shape length pillow 3 the price it mentioned , pillow simple made , i guess 's idea costs much all items could probably improved manufacturer product really make perfect pregnancy product 
+1	what great pillow my daughter used last several months pregnancy after baby arrived , still uses prop breastfeeding very versatile she says could n't gotten last months pregnancy without ! excellent quality design 
+1	buy one soon find pregnant i waited weeks good sleep , wing several times pressure belly slept 2 night 4 months pregnant just loooove the problem i n't want get bed morning , 's almost comfortable

+1	this great body pillow what i wish i could change : - would nice ends thicker firmer perhaps i like head support - 's expensive- 's bulky- pillow case rah hulk smash raaahhhhhhhhseriously , need make zipper something pregnancy hormones + maternity pillow case = someone 's gon na pay otherwise , 's great 
+1	i hesitant spend $ 53 pillow i decided buy , made difference ! i 've since last september i still use every day ! once i found i pregnant , i tried transition back/stomach sleeper side sleeper i very hard time i could n't get deep sleep with snoogle , head rests comfortably `` c '' end i put `` j '' end legs my hands usually end hugging pillow i switch sleeping right left sides since i use every day , gotten flatter time , still works i start 39th week tomorrow ! my critique difficult turn side side night still , best financial investment pregnancy ! 
+1	this pillow awesome , super comfy ! ! ! it helped ( lot ) sleep pregnancy i still use ! 
+1	one disclaimer -- 're used sleeping feather pillow comforter , n't buy different cover snoogle , 're going overheat short order it 's stuffed polyester , fine -- holds shape well supports -- cover , becomes waaay hot that said , i love shape support pillow gives i 've 2 nights , first night ( without separately purchased jersey cover ) hot , new cover , i already tell i 'm waking flopping around bed less the also-pregnant friend recommended snoogle said dad got one likes back trouble , i may recommend poor sleepers life so , snoogle original cover : 4 stars snoogle jersey cover : 5 stars 
-1	my friend lent snoogle pregnancy , swearing comfortable thing 'd ever experienced i loved first night , found getting repeatedly tangled unable maintain adjustments i needed sleep comfortably ( since entire pillow connected , move one part , rest wants move ) i eventually curled `` o '' shape wall behind bed prop i watch tv i also found stuffed full give belly under-support needed now i 'm using belly wedge regular flat , rectangular body pillow , well couple supplementary pillows i need a million times better un-tameable monster thanks , thanks one 
+1	during first pregnancy , i used boppy pillow smaller took less room bed that pillow worked ok second pregnancy i wanted something would support better i researched pillow impressed comfortable i bought 4th month i able sleep restfully night ! i impressed the reason i giving four stars 8th month i thought getting little flat i not feel held well - using four months of course , time pregnancy i uncomfortable lot ( not i sleeping ) may factor i still not sleep without ! as far size - bigger especially since i used bobby sleep pillow half size i 5 ' 8 '' length worked ! 
+1	i could not get pregnancy without pillow i initially bought larger , u-shaped pillow one worked better keeping rolling onto back it pain put cover washing , would n't stop buying product i might even keep using baby born ! 
+1	last pregnancy i ordered & # 34 ; leachco back 'n belly contoured body pillow & # 34 ; ( http : //www amazon com/leachco-belly-contoured-pillow-ivory/dp/b0002e7diq/ref=sr_1_2 ? s=baby-products & ie ; =utf8 & qid ; =1390183256 & sr ; =1-2 ) since i thought symmetrical pillow would easier it pretty comfortable , even king size bed , took ton room it hot , i felt like giant divider husband i also felt like top dug shoulder - i never quite sure put bottom arm ( i 'm terrible side sleeper hence need pillow ) it also seemed lose & # 34 ; fluff & # 34 ; end months this time i decided go & # 34 ; leachco snoogle total body pillow & # 34 ; - i 'm hooked ! i n't used long enough see & # 34 ; fluff factor & # 34 ; works , concerns not & # 34 ; symmetrical pillow & # 34 ; alleviated it 's super easy use , intuitive , takes much less space i love support , 's n't hot like pillow - allows snuggle husband 's right side - added perk ! i feel way less 'isolated ' bed pillow would definitely recommend 
+1	purchasing pillow , sleeping side became much easier supportive back pain completely alleviated started using snoogle takes lot space bed , minor drawback considering comfortable pillow worth every cent spent ! 
-1	i purchased pillow early pregnancy , worked well first months however , i found pillow really flattened use , i eventually switched using multiple regular pillows order get enough support i not large person either ( 115 pounds pregnancy ) , n't take much once i made switch regular pillows , i found multiple pillows much easier maneuver around now i final weeks turning really difficult , i would not go back snoogle 
+1	i pretty skeptical looking item purchase sure model looks comfortable position 's paid ! i not side sleeper pregnancy n't getting good sleep since beginning pregnancy around week 18 , i gave forked $ 50 stupid looking pillow when i sleep side without snoogle , arm underneath gets trapped circulation cuts wakes middle night since getting snoogle , i never problem granted i wake middle night switch positions ( pee ) since arm n't fall asleep , i wake less frequently i like sleeping hugging long side open side initially pictured i read people complaining cover , n't expect high threadcount 'll fine 
+1	i sleeping thing since i 9 weeks pregnant super comfy since i side sleeper supports legs nicely very good purchase ! 
+1	this pillow saved ! well , honestly , i n't know anything different bc first pregnancy i used every night survive without i vacation but best ! i tended long part behind i 'd sort halfway lean i 'd legs head and i used regular pillow head regular pillow stomach , made i could lean back prego pillow i side sleeper , i also like sleep back so pillow made sort possible i n't back , i least leaning something better nothing ! you get tired sleeping left side ! ! ! oh , also i really far along , i started sleeping hip versus legs hips hurt i wanted sleep back bad get pressure cant ! 
+1	my & # 34 ; baby & # 34 ; 14 months yet , pillow never left bed i love 's pillow i one head , one hold legs -- - not pregnant , i used wake pain lower back legs i dealt slipped discs , sciatic nerve pain general back pain while 's not totally perfect , pillow relieves majority that what i n't like pillow case difficult you ca n't wash pillow , case n't terrible get ; 's getting back 's time consuming i also think $ 50 pillow steep but , 'll never buy another pillow , jury 
+1	i began using early pregnancy i n't think i could sleep without the thing i would change & # 34 ; head part & # 34 ; i wish big lower part 
+1	bought daughter 4 months pregnant she loves uses every night help back pain pressure growing belly highly recommend 
+1	i pessimistic buying body pillow first seeing reviews online mixed reviews i originally attempted stack position pillows king size bed found always hassle i shifted positions , went restroom wanted change sides i sleeping i also concerned pillow cover people complained difficult put ( see organic snoogle pillow cover review ) when i received snoogle took packaging , i afraid going take lot bed it worked fine actually took less space regular pillows i piling i actually bought snoogle i 18 weeks pregnant since suggested i start sleeping side now used bit time ( currently 21 weeks ) tummy stick , i 'm really find snoogle really helps keep position the great thing i also use things like reading also feeding baby later it comes insert shows different ways use snoogle my favorite way sleep snoogle either left side right side it cradles back perfectly i sleep left hand side sometimes i unknowingly roll back towards flat position sleeping left side , support snoogle keeps still somewhat diagonal without completely flat as reviewers mentioned , said snoogle gets flat time wished 'poufy ' i n't found issues found adequate height although i 'm not type sleeps many pillows head the snoogle come basic cover removable washing however i opt buy organic cover well 
+1	being pregnant , i know i supposed sleep side but i simply not always wake flat back this pillow kept side probably 70 % time ( rough estimate based i find i wake ) i thankful 
+1	this pillow great sleeping aid prego its still gets used body pillow its also great couch , lol ! 
+1	i got pillow early 2nd trimester love ! it 's great side sleeping back support sitting bed i followed reviewers ' advice air dried cover husband put **update** i inspired chiropractor office belly pillows lie stomach one night i extremely achy back around 28 weeks , i made donut pillow gently laid amazing ! first time i 'd able `` lie '' stomach bed my amazing hubby proceeded give back rub : ) 
+1	i used throughout pregnancy , final days big belly heavy careless big darn thing ! my husband named `` leroy '' often like 3rd person bed saved back hips it wonderful present receive beginning pregnancy i recommend anyone wants congratulate friend , daughter sister , etc the thing i found untrue using nurse , way long i tried wrapping around i pushed forward i uncomfy , baby fine ; - ) i passed non-preggo cousin back problems 
+1	this pillow great ! used thought pregnancy nurse even sleep so comfortable durable , keeps shape would recommend get friend pregnant 
+1	i 7 months pregnant owned three weeks what relief ! i thought using standard body pillow going good enough nope ! the & # 34 ; downer & # 34 ; pillow awkward size length but 's not use otherwise , helpful my husband even enjoys hugging onto i get i highly recommend pillow 're difficulty getting comfortable its even wonderful sitting propped 're difficulty everything pushing diaphragm buy ! ! 
+1	a friend recommended snoogle i asked `` must haves '' pregnancy at first i little skeptical , especially 's pretty expensive pillow i 'm glad i purchased ! i 'm 22 weeks along trying use regular pillows props provide support also prevent flipping onto stomach i typically use snoogle head additional pillows , long side front support belly i may may not use bottom curve kneees if i need roll i still use pillow head knees i n't constantly flip i roll i 'm 5'8 '' i fit comfortably it 's also great use prop bed i 'm reading watching tv definitely aware large pillow i cuddle close n't issue queen size bed may not work everyone all , i 'm thrilled i bought wonder i 'll want give even baby born 
-1	i n't anything add 's uncomfortable n't ease discomfort i used one night 
+1	i currently six months pregnant using every night past month i love i use several different ways provide comfort i need pregnancy i use prop night i bad acid reflux , nights i use back support something legs help prevent leg cramps i recommend pregnant woman looking better night sleep !

+1	more comfy boppy body pillow 1st pregnancy , still not amazing pillow i hoped ( fair , may not pillow ) still , necessity second half pregnancy i like removable , washable cover would recommend friend , definitely would recommend boppy 
-1	i purchased pillow never successfully slept entire night it really quite large feels confining wrapped around sheets i felt like i could n't move could n't get comfortable plus , material really scratchy awful - forcing shell additional money cover way over-priced mine sits corner bedroom for $ 20 i bought body pillow ultra soft cover target i love sleep every night save money ! 
+1	this pillow life saver throughout pregnancy it helps keep sleeping side supports hips , belly head i sometimes even catch husband using ! 
-1	i not find item comfortable ! maybe i petite item not plyable became far cumbersome it took great deal space bed hard thick use head furthermore , not supply enough back support i prefered use heatable neck pillow support back honestly , would better served purchase bolster pillow knees heatable ( chamomile lavender ) beanbag pillow spend fifty dollars baby instead !

-1	when i first bought snoogle , i loved , perfectly supportive promised then toddler barfed bed , unfortunately splashed snoogle snoogle 's cover washed snoogle 's cover snug , without hint stretch snoogle 's one cover opening awkward location i frustrated trying put snoogle 's cover back washing i left left pillow bare big mistake snoogle 's supportive secret cover left without , 's basically flat blob cheap batting stores body heat like extra-lumpy camel spits back night why people devise ways frustrate pregnant women ? finally , today , i put snoogle 's cover back , half-hour twisting , writhing , cursing taking two breaks i got stupid cover back n't even post-coital glow added benefit my recommendation ? buy straight fairly flexible body pillow it 's i first pregnancy we simply used two king cases cover , i problem curving fit knees needed 
+1	this pillow wonderful there number ways manipulate support whatever part happens aching day i use support back , belly neck mostly it bit cumbersome , instead trying get pillows grasp , i remove pillow bed instead i 5'2 & # 34 ; quite bit extra pillow -but i wrap farther around body 's comfortable ! tag reads meets california 's flame retardant standards even brand new , right package , toxic smell

+1	i shocked wife could suddenly sleep night pregnancy thing thank god if mama aint happy , aint nobody happy 
+1	i really liked pillow it super comfortable early pregnancy now i 31 weeks quite bit bigger , pillow kind pain get really good job wrapping around , much struggle getting i still like , i would still recommend , i n't think idea pillow 25 weeks 
-1	i checked online reviews product spending money i difficulty getting comfortable sleeping night i decided try snoogle i since returned snoogle i felt i could not get pillow position comfortable the top curve way regular pillow bottom curve never right spot i long part pillow i also felt pillow not support belly well thick-i felt uncomfortable i prefer regular body pillows find much comfort using them-for lot less money 
+1	i thought indulgent buy pillow pregnancy read regular body pillows fine well friends one , i bought amazon i glad i ! ! not only pillow i sleep ( husband 's delight , gets bed pillows ) , i also use sit bed wrap around sitting one end wrapped legs one end wrapped around belly makes super comfortable & # 34 ; bed chair & # 34 ; something like ! i absolutely love i registered additional slipcover 
-1	i much trouble getting restful sleep position 6 months i loved idea pillow & good reviews i 5'6 '' & 130 pounds i large belly , yet i small size i normally side sleeper the shape pillow not fit body correctly ( pre-shaped curves ) if put head curve head arm fall asleep & i normally sleep arm head , i n't get my belly not supported & i still woke back pain it takes way much room queen size bed , pushing dad 2 almost floor ! i still found wanting flip & could not without constantly waking husband i think pillow may work , yet not i stick multi-pillow props 
+1	i could n't imagine sleeping pregnant without snoogle ! i even recommend others back problems ( men women ) i n't think husband crazy , pretty bulky now i 'm nearly second pregnancy , starting get pretty squashed i 'm back using additional pillows well i really wish cover nicer fabric easier clean all though , genius product really meets needs pregnant women ! ( and i would argue good ergonomic pillow back problems ) 
+1	initially , upper curve rather thick & firm , high neck - i 'd wake achy stiff neck but rest pillow worked well i stuck , maybe 3-4 weeks , head part softened comfortable time as another reviewer mentioned also happens , i sometimes wake back , comfortably cradled snoogle , one curve head behind knees but thing - pregnant women n't supposed sleep backs b/c restrict oxygen nutrient flow fetus i n't want comfortable back ! ! this n't pillow 's fault , i get , one reason i bought keep side , i wanted pass along anyone else might considering reason it helps , n't prevent back-sleeping pros : ( 1 ) one pillow maneuver ; firm soft enough comfortable ; ( 2 ) 's good size ( neck area softened ) @ 5'4 '' 143 pre-preg weight ; ( 3 ) not percale , pillowcase feels fine , tho i also plan make second cover softer knit jersey ; ( 4 ) sleep still broken , i 'm able get longer stretches snoogle i using regular pillows ; ( 5 ) less room bed , i still fit & snoogle onto half queen-size mattress con : ( 1 ) price ( 's basic pillow filling , not gel anything fancy ; polyfil costs couple bucks bag i really think making $ 30+ profit per pillow ) ; ( 2 ) cover hard take put ; velcro , buttons , zipper would much better approach ; ( 3 ) maneuvering blankets winter tricksy - i throw back blankets , lift pillow , move body , put pillow back often i ( inadvertently , i swear ! ) smack husband head upper curve trying extricate lower curve sheets gets old quick , esp i 'm 4-8x/night ; ( 4 ) 's middle bed , husband tends hug body pillow , complicating extrication/flipping process again , not pillow 's fault , amusing 
+1	i lower back pain early second trimester snoogle proved good cure for wise investment , though many women could get similar results sleeping regular pillow knees some reviewers complained snoogle rough exterior , i found cover ( included model ) smooth texture much like decent pillowcase ( without cover , yes snoogle rough ) i also found stuffing inside snoogle quite sufficient - enough provide support , not much body pillow felt hard as petite woman ( 5'2 '' ) i worried pillow arrived i might need smaller mini-snoogle , i found ( regular size ) work fine yes , large pillow take bed space , queen 's plenty room snoogle , two normal-size people , even couple cats all-in-all i found snoogle good product wise investment

+1	this pillow made comfortable night i could sleep easier around fifth month , i hard time sleeping i could not get comfortable awakened frequent leg cramps i put pillow head , around back legs it kept left side night extra support legs lessened leg cramps the cover washed nicely pillow rolled fit right back plastic bag baby born my complaints takes much room bed sheets tucked , pillow case difficult get needs washed pillow n't fit well woman picture i 5'10 '' head fits top end bottom end goes thighs instead knees but overall , i happy purchase 
+1	i got pillow i 10 weeks pregnant it really make sleep easier pregnancy back pain , however i never able get position pictured label my belly ( even later pregnancy ) never lay top pillow like it good support legs somewhat belly behind back i n't used nursing , good supporting baby 're lying together my negative makes quite hot , especially pregnant there seems little ventilation pillow

+1	comfortable , bag come makes easy keep track wash 
+1	they feel great , better paper/disposable ones i love washing bag gives well the con look kinda lumpy first bra , i noticed i shirt seems form fine very comfortable ! 
+1	i 5 years i used 2 kids year using i always wore even i n't really leaking anymore nipples sensitive i n't like touching bra i 2 falling apart-i bought 2 sets they show unless light padding bra i found hard way exhausted put lace side 's not soft super uncomfortable my second son loved put `` boobie pad '' ear nursing 12 months + would actually find one laundry basket snuggle naps : ) i plan buy another set 3rd child i notice lanolins would stain n't absorbent enough early days i used disposables first 6ish weeks 
+1	i tried gerber disposables , lansinoh disposables & avent disposables , well avent reusables & tommy tippee reusables avent thicker absorbent disposables reusables , although found none disposables stay place well reusables 
-1	i purchased 2 packs pads first child 4 years ago i really liked second , i needed one pack due lost years they still come great washable mesh bag , new pads smaller using different materials first sets i not like new style , old version:4 5 '' diameterpoly lace exteriorjersey knit interior ( negative- feels wet quickly ) overall absorbentmolds breast shape create concave pad interiornew version : ~4 '' diameterpoly lace exteriorflannel interior ( positive- n't feel wet ) thin not absorbentstays flat shape n't mold breast shapethe plus last set flannel interior overall i not like smaller size n't think nearly absorbent older sets i i keep emergency pads older sets remain everyday choice 
-1	the pads small size , not effectively coverage breasts even move around slightly , miss cover become wet pads soak nursing bra if enlarge coverage size thickness , lace design would perfect for frame reference , i 32dd size small small even 
+1	i avent products i thought i would try one well i not really expecting would great pads , affordable price , good enough 
+1	i tried types nursing pads , ones i personally prefer thick , absorbent , heavy duty they last lot longer others i tried , hold shape wash unlike others bunch wrinkle also , washing bag comes breast pads great use baby 's socks , hand mitts , etc i n't use bag breast pads , i throw wash n't lost yet i highly recommend ! 
+1	these worked great daughter , accidents night time fine daytime use 
+1	these pads great way protecting environment they fit bra snugly easily washable 
-1	after i baby milk came , i leaking like crazy tired spending money disposables these arrived i put right away however , i leaked right though ! they waterproof backing thin leak even tiny bit , screwed additionally , scratchy itchy poor sore nipples stuck fabric imagine horror trying peel raw nipples : ( 
+1	i use well avent disposables never tried brand i 'm satisfied maybe i n't let lot i 've never leaking issue my bras mostly padded 're not noticeable even i wear non padded nursing bras still not visible love included machine bag 
-1	i liked still use sometimes , not absorb much disposable kind , especially night time tend get engorged i would leak right , sleep bra , night gown not fun wake covered breast milk : / 
+1	i bought inserts washable ones seemed environmentally friendly recommended friend they work expected , embarrassing wet spots shirts i wish i cold wear night longer 3-4 hours without soaking wet needing new pair during daytime , not problem 
-1	i bought i hate using disposables adding waste problem i 'm sure better washable pads these completely flat n't bend much contour breast nipple they super obvious thin bra tank top plus , stick -- not horribly still undesirable i like bag comes overall , i would n't buy product recommend 
-1	these barely absorbed i it like milk beaded i high hopes i let 
+1	these great throw wash , however leak heavily might want add disposable behind ca n't change pad not leak proof always 
+1	my complaint 2 3 washes fabric may start `` pill '' i use lanolin make sure pretreat dish soap allow sit overnight be sure use included mesh bag become trapped upright washing machine agitator 
+1	love pads was sceptical first lace one side , less visible shirt ones without lace outside they ar small , yet absorbant i leak got really wet i like 3 pair , order might want order 2 sets do n't forget use included back wash , tend get lost pants legs washing machine abys 
-1	i like look , lace outer layer cute , n't hold moisture well it 's absorbent flannel burp cloth - leak tiny bit , 'll go right pad i used night occasionally 're soft would keep milk running shirt , shirt would damp every feeding they 're also thick , makes noticeable shirt if want great cloth nursing pad , get bamboobies - 're way absorbent , thinner , less noticeable , cuter do n't waste money 
+1	not soft fleece ones i usually use , least 're cotton when i 'm especially leaky , i swap fresh ones , get rather damp 
+1	soft right size i wish would stop making nursing pads round make little breast shaped cant see thru shirt far every ones still round they n't think see thru thin shirt 
+1	these good job keeping dry day , constantly move around night , i really need 
+1	like pads ! the design awesome side feels smooth washed not problems like cheap ones walmart 
+1	didnt want use disposables think throwing away money wash great stay white ! washing machine bag great bonus 
+1	i really like avent pads after wash keep shape ( love free mesh bag ! ) , lint attached nipple like different brands stay place due lace cover bra side also absorb leakage well milk n't go , unless pretty heavy one i wear bras nursing tops one tell i wear pads only night i adjust due laying side , not biggie i wear often disposable ones ( i use lansinoh like , tend roll i fold bra breastfeed adjusting annoying glue side ) 
-1	this product not stop even slow flow milk wife it soaked leaked within 10-20 minutes she tried two times threw away not worth cost since i buying wife idea pad would work , i also got & # 34 ; charlie banana nursing pads & # 34 ; much , much better well worth slight cost increase ! 
-1	i bought two orders , 12 nursing pad hoping 'd work well i would n't buy disposable pads i hoping save waste money well , till i figured pads n't really useful started buy disposable ones here 's pads n't great:1 they n't large enough cover good amount area 2 they slide around lot , i find something soaked randomly - least happened i home , not outside ! 3 they not seamless , show clothes 4 and most importantly , n't super absorbent i n't really leak much , even i find changing pads 2 3 times day so i 'm using disposable pads i wish worked well 
+1	these things hold well never seem cause wife discomfort the biggest complaint diappear like socks would i highly recommend getting think need 'go missing ' still pair two handy i recently found stuck inside one shirts , another hidden boxers laundered blame static , , hard find really need prepare accordingly ! 
-1	i still leak they n't absorbent ones i bought etsy basically i use i 'm desperate 
+1	a must breast feeding these however little thick side you need wearing heavier shirt sweater/ sweat shirt conceal pads place comes nice small nylon bag wash 
+1	my niece loved pads she used time comfortable n't show clothes because wash reuse even better if i 'd wanted 2 packs first baby learn ! 
+1	the breast pads soft absorb well i still leak pads breasts very engorged ( i think would occur similar product ) 
+1	these great instead buy disposables time , i use night , hand wash shower next morning , hang dry reuse next night 
+1	bought chance try ended loving they n't lay nicest bra , save serious dough not use disposable ones would recommend washing first use though : ) highly recommended 
-1	was n't impressed avent washable nursing pads following reasons : - material non-absorbant- material not soft options available- pads stick nipples- lace outside seen bra/nursing tank- small circle creates strange raised bump seen outside 
+1	i n't leak much standards definitely useful giving peace mind i bought two packs i 'd enough work week they 're visible shirt thin bra skin tight shirt i n't wear hooker clothes i usually wear cardigan not problem 
+1	these perfect job highly absorbent prevents & # 34 ; leak through & # 34 ; also better breast since silicone pads occlude breast linked increased instances mastitis keeping simple cotton nursing pads

-1	not good cloth diaper the inserts inefficient pulling moisture away baby 's bottom this result diaper rashes you might well use prefolds use cover save lots money rather use diapers besides leaks diaper , really stiff i wanted like diaper , disappointed we much happier happy heiny 's bumgenius all-in-ones 
+1	i used diapers months 4 10 ( counting ) large rotation diapers ( prefolds bumgenius organics ) finally feel qualified write review overall , i pleased like cloth diapers , success wth particular brand/style may depend baby 's build activity level we small/avg baby definitely n't fit 10 lbs , probably like 12-14 he ebf point still n't problem handling waste now 10 months , dh 's go diaper fast diaper changes squiggler the fabric stays inside waterproof , 's adjusting checking make sure 's tucked , easy one step velcro fast the problem i seeing ds gets bigger around , top fold little bit , causing wicking i also n't know last another baby 's worth use , cotton starting pill pul getting stiff but $ 8/diaper opposed bg o $ 25/diaper , defintely fabulous value 
+1	i like these diapers a lot ! they fit well and leaks are rare usually over night if it happens we have found that if you put a washable liner into the diapers at night it almost eliminates leaks all together they do take a long time to dry , so you need to consider this when washing them also , i have noticed some break down of the cover by the waste band after several months of use they still work ; but can cause an irritation on our sons abdomen if not watched i have not tried any other brand ; so i have nothing to compare it to but i think it is so important to do everything that can be done to help the environment and this is a great start 
+1	i 've cloth diapered 3 kids i say far favorite i 've tried expensive $ 20+ piece diapers work better ! yeah n't cute work 's i care ! never leak i love natural cotton hard find aio diaper most synthetic material lead stink build issues the people saying bulky huh ! ? comparing disposable diapers cloth diapers ? nothing going trim disposable , paper , cloth actually trim cloth diapers ! i started using infant size youngest 10lbs even trim with said , work , durable priced right ! 
+1	i small baby i bought kooshies he came home 6 pounds 20 inches long ( long lanky ) , newborn size still seemed little bulky ( although not seem care ) i tried use preemie newborn sized disposable short term visits leaked badly i change clothes almost every time ! this three different people putting as result i bring kooshies even go ! they soft absorbant leak far less two disposables i tried try kooshies , you will not be sorry ! ! ! update : now baby little bigger ( around 9 5 pounds , 23 inches ) , i still using newborn size folded liner front this significantly reduces leakage urine overnight although disposables working better , kooshies still work good , not better i still love kooshies 
+1	i ordered four different kinds prefolds try : gerber birdseye , osocozy bleached , osocozy unbleached , kushies initially , i used osocozy diapers smaller size gerbers kushies however , dirty one day i pulled kushie gerber hello ! ! the kushies much absorbent either two brands even though large , fit well son 's thirsties duo snap wraps size one , initial concern the extra material increases effectiveness , fabric ( flannel ) absorbent fabrics even diaper soaked , not feel wet soggy brands for reason , i think gentle son 's skin -- and 's softer fabrics ! for , i one pack , become overnight diapers i soon ordering make sole brand my diaper system : i use thirsties duo snap wraps prefolds ; i tried several brands , prefer kushies i stash dirty diapers planet earth wet/dry bag i chance spray mini-shower bidet & handheld sprayer , i dunk bambino mio diaper bucket half-filled water 1/2 cup borax i wash i run one rinse cycle , wash hot water charlie 's soap single rinse so far , stains , skin irritation ! i one load diaper laundry per day

+1	i 've always used gerbers honest , i never know i 'm going get i open package , i know i 'm disappointed absorbency gerbers started looking something better i 've kushies couple weeks i 'm pleased they n't appear thicker gerber , feel denser they also larger so fold , 's like double diaper without bulk the kushies also softer gerber the cost gerbers , i need use one kushies two gerbers less laundry kushies i 'm using one i buy kushies 
+1	these great burp cloths ! ( i actually would like little bit larger though ) i bought one package , ended coming back buying 2 if buying first child , not believe many burp cloths 'll go every day - stock ! 
+1	after searching online many retail stores malls , target , babies toys 'r us walmart , i finding gauze type `` cloth diapers '' i appalled considered soft enough absorbent put close baby ! so , success , i came amazon found many incredible reviews product using burp cloths i decided order one package arrived i thrilled soft looked forward using new baby they absorb great amount formula since son quite dribbler wash wondefully in fact , i think even gotten softer we happy product purchased another package within first days used them so , looking use way find gauze type found stores unacceptable , get ! ! ! you wo n't regret ! 
-1	i bought compare bumkins bummis prefolds turned not absorbent either i used couple times decided put storage they also impossible use snappis fastner definitely not usable overnight 
+1	we grabbed tub @ brus little guy started arching past guard infant tub it 's great investment ! when first started sit could lounge tail i actually think fact 's inflatable helped strengthen core enough sit successfully if topples lands cushy air ! now 's crawling , flops around , tub still prevents crawling since ca n't seem get balance wobbly surface well worth money !

-1	i got pump , electric one little noisy i n't like waking daughter middle night at first pump worked great getting rid engorgement pumping milk then started making slurping noises rings suction started not go properly ( i never sterilized parts sterilizer anything else placed parts dishwasher , reason parts not fitting right ca n't warped damaged someway ) then , milk supply started diminish , due pumps inability stimulate breasts keep producing , i guess feature would good wanted stop breastfeeding ease engorgement i switch breastfeeding exclusively , bottles , stimulate milk supply back , daughter refuses take bottle ever so pump sits 's little travel bag collecting dust , waist $ 50 00 
+1	i say , first time mother i really thought breastfeeding would simple looks wrong ! i pain despite fact son latching correctly my breasts swollen i thought would burst feeding time sent frenzy tears luckily , mother breastfed she went got pump ( i sure i would n't need i got close returning work ) relief short follow the pump easy assemble easy use i could express enough milk 10 minutes satisfy son give much needed break least one feeding per day i wo n't go great detail features since many reviews just assured difficult time breastfeeding first , pump might save sanity one point note , i see people problems plastic neck cracking if read directions carefully tell not use anti-bacterial soap wash pump avent plastic pieces ( including bottles i assume ) some chemical soap cause plastic crack that could contributing factor defective pieces 
-1	after medela harmony suddonly quit working , i rush new pump ended getting avent isis at first i thought i purchased dud , minutes pump grabbed big time , i expressing milk faster i ever harmony i find pump works better i remove rubber `` petal '' lining and pump squeeky the frustrating thing though using little month little white disk would pop place , i would get really strong suction going then i would stop take pump apart get disk back position also , wide bottles n't fit well bottle compartment diaper bag , daughter not use wide nipples i use avent bottles store milk , i use medela bottles feeding , kind hassle compared able pump directly feeding bottle

-1	i got pump baby nursing strike , helped i engorged even n't whiz i 'm back normal , hardly works the last time i used ( i could night ) took 3 attempts hour combined efforts get 4 oz milk ( would n't know , drank 1/2 ounce ) even i would finally get let , action/suction n't enough keep going also , i could n't get message cushion work the instructions say assemble pump wet improve seal cushion & quot ; diaphram & quot ; , still n't help it would stay sealed couple pumps , unseal seal -- very frustrating deal -- makes hard relax like need plus , realize many cycles hospital pumps go get however much milk , 's lot squeezing , also not relaxing i pleased w/ pump i used hospital looking seriously buying ameda purely yours breastpump ( low $ 140 online searches ) 
+1	this pump good need pump twice day it 's small , easy clean thrown diaper bag on-the-road access it 's little trying hand - not nearly bad one give hospital if pump time , time - i would suggest medela automatic pump it gets far milk time takes 1/3 time

+1	here 's tub makes baby parent feel secure bath time we got tub two years ago son we used year now using newborn daughter this tub two outstanding features first , hammock holds newborn infant snugly this makes baby feel secure gives ability hand free thus , 's possible one person bathe baby solo without worrying baby fall water second , hammock adjustable straps , raised lowered this allows baby water sponge bath prior first weeks 're not supposed submerged once cord stub falls , lower hammock water little much want as baby grows , remove hammock baby lie inclined side strength sit then , sitting well , use straight-backed side because tub small , 's easier keep baby upright even n't mastered sitting also , another advantage bath seat goes floor bathtub little bath n't require much water fill , making bath time simpler quicker some reviewers complained tub not drain completely open drain plug this absolutely true ; however , i think drain plug merely intended drain vast majority water -- -- turn tub rinse drain completely without drain feature , filled tub would incredibly heavy , making nearly impossible turn pour water ( not mention mess 'd probably make trying dump water sink ! )

+1	it 's really simple use put , rinse hot water put nipple the lactation consultant hospital gave nipple shield help baby start breastfeeding what n't mention n't supposed used long term decreases milk supply initially worked great , 4 weeks i told another lc i wanted maintain supply , i 'd get baby actual breast trying transition shield onto nipple hell used plastic ; i eventually gave trying transition , i continued use shield even though supply dwindling just words advice anyone wants breastfeed : very very difficult- 's amazing something natural could feel unnatural sometimes i went much pain discomfort i hated first 6 weeks , i fell love i felt deep bond daughter i breastfed pain discomfort disappeared i actually looked forward breastfeeding instead despising ! but time began reject breast preferred bottle i breastfed almost 3 months shield , 's definitely worth even use month two weeks , 's worth , benefits amazing ca n't complain price a words : anything artificial decrease milk supply-formula , pumping , pacifiers , using bottles ( confuse nipple plastic nipple prefer plastic flow much easier ) the best thing nurse ( although may not always realistic ) to help increase milk supply : nurse often first weeks , n't give pacifiers , bottles formula also , try taking fenugreek supplemnents ( mother 's milk ) , worked well me and last not least , 've tried tried breastfeed 's not happening , not feel guilty 
+1	i needed son nurse they work great needed not much else say word minimum reviews

+1	no research soothing cracked nipples things mentioned i heard sister-in-law it seems 1st kid , nipples sensitive first time around this helped protect crack baby sucking time you could pump help solve problem , i not want middle night i already tired this made much easier deal night , day i limited time in lieu nipple shield , i also recommend hydrogel pads little cooling , soothing protection i went 2 months cracked nipple , trying methods i found online , i told product it helped speed recovery time ! 
+1	i 1st time mom conquered breastfeeding thanks shield my baby completely rubbed skin nipples breastfeeding painful i started using shield thankfully , healing we use shield feeding now i n't feel pain feedings this helped much 
+1	my baby nicu week & fed bottle hard establish breastfeeding lactation nurse gave full coverage version try even though worked always seemed flip almost cover baby 's nose i concerned breathing i got right away i noticed difference within week i able `` trick '' feeding without shields , yay ! 
+1	my baby pretty poor latch serious damage nipples with help lactation consulant , i best correct latch , little effect , week 3 tried you need use correctly , nipple guard help latching issues soreness i give 4 stars n't always stay put , 's nature product , i think 
+1	i could smack lactation consultants not recommending nipple shields i told breastfeeding painful my son 4 weeks old 've pumping exclusively feeding bottle trying filing get latch properly with nipple shield , latched second try they say things reduce supply nipples n't come contact baby well , guess much contact exclusive pumping : none ! now see get nurse regularly shields 
-1	baby would not latch starting day 3 i started using nipple shield temporary solution , baby latched right & # 34 ; contact & # 34 ; definitely best one however , would not ween latch nipple weeks trying breastfeeding also became extremely painful shield boy 8 weeks , seen multiple lactation consultants , midwives & doctors , gotten tongue tie clipped , treated everything sun still latch ! think nipple shield delayed proper treatment allowed develop preference artificial nipples although 'm still trying breastfeed daily usually use bottle still hopeful !

+1	i could not nursed without shield my son born 3 weeks early trouble sucking latch this helped able latch helped nurse 
+1	my baby latch problems caused tons nipple pain this helped us make breastfeeding although definitely helps reduce pain , tends move around , annoying recommendation : lubricate lanolin first help stick breast

+1	breastfeeding always shown natural , wonderful experience in beginning horrible experience from day one , baby n't latch right result nipples cracked , bled , hurt much every time i put baby breast , i screamed pain since i bad time , i going resort formula i felt horrible i determined breast feed my mother law suggested calling niece breast feeding advocate i went ahead called this i learned nipple shield she told used whole year breast fed helped protect nipples so husband brought shield i put breast fed baby at first n't keen plastic nipple , eventually took this allowed nipples heal back up my intention use every time i breastfed , two weeks i decided take try my baby problem latching back onto nipple worked latched there still soreness , week got hang now six months old still 100 % breast fed i grown love nursing shield , i able continue 
-1	i know ca n't expect much products horrible i followed directions , washed soap let soak 20 minutes using after first use became flimsy sticky would n't stick nipple i expected went trash right away was 
+1	i recommend using short term use they not recommended long-term , affect milk supply , and/or transfer milk baby , causing slow weight gain however , women use one entire breastfeeding relationship never problem i sore/cracked/blistered bleeding nipples bad latch breastfeeding extremely painful the first time i used shield , i felt pain it instantly gone the shield quickly filled milk baby swallowing sounds i hold place lot times , wash everytime i done , well worth if give breastfeeding problems latch , save breastfeeding relationship try quit 
+1	i hesitant use type breast shield information i given said would cause decrease milk supply nipple confusion baby so , first weeks breastfeeding i suffered i cried , bled , husband practically begged stop , could n't stand see much pain as last resort quitting breastfeeding i went target bought shield much research i decided least worth trying milk supply decreased , would least better milk rather forced use formula i wish i would known much would helped since day 1 once i used shield , i could finally stand give full feeding without using painkiller the cracks nipples finally chance heal ! within week , nipples healed using combination lanolin apno cream ( also works miracles ) after weeks fully healed nipples , i weaned nipple shield since exclusively breastfeeding without resort formula bottle feeding without shield i n't think would possible properly heal cracks nipples , one point bleed bad caused get infectious mastitis take antibiotics i wish common recommend especially beginning babies mouths smaller less likely get full latch i found milk supply not affected actually seemed go better i likely frequent feedings sides shield update : at son 's last health check , 4 months 18 lbs 12 oz 26 5 '' he consistently 95th percentile height weight ( based who charts breastfed babies ) since third week ( i started using shield ) , testament i decrease milk supply i also able pump small supply emergencies before shield , lost 10 % bodyweight birth recommended hospital doctors office supplement using formula i did not , stuck breast , help shield , continued exclusively breastfeed throughout good luck everyone stick ! 
+1	i hardest time getting son latch the nurses working every feeding refused stay latched ! i close quitting but nurse given one amazing ! i n't hard time getting latch stay ! he got use would n't nurse without it i use daughter she sleepy baby hard time latching hospital , i made sure i brought one shields after weeks i tried nursing without latched without shield fine ! ( see girls really smarter boys , naa-naa-boo-boo ! ) i continue nurse daughter using shield 's much easier get latch nursing cover , easier case i 'm engorged , decides 's done comes i 'm middle let n't messy mess pools shield seconds giving time grab spit rag now i 'm around moms kids around age mine , i 've heard tell known nursing shields probably would breastfed child instead switching formula

-1	this thing would not stay suctioned table period took back day 
+1	i two placemats one diaper bag one used backup washed i bought numerous friends everyone loves the one drawback one friends - daughter learned right away pull table refuses use eveyone else i know problems it catches food 's little pocket , keeps table clean easy rollup store away i ca n't say enough product my husband , daughter i eat 1-2 times week ( 230 mths old 've dines since born ) use everytime 's table stick ( everything tablecloth ) we 've used sine daughter old enough high chair 
+1	my son would pull table i better plastic ones stick 
+1	since son started sitting high chairs restaurants , i 've always worried eating dirty tables ( licking ) so i found rubber placemat , i thought perfect eating it takes little space diaper bag since rolls `` catch tray '' , 's super easy wipe clean , doubles `` protective guard '' baby n't hit face edge tables the suction pretty decent , sticks surfaces all , inexpensive , great product ! ! 
+1	i love product ! it works wonders i made sure i tested 5 different restaurants i posted it worked well 's job t ! lets honest , messy kids , chances 're not going get one item floor impossible this product definitely minimizes issue 90 % i 'm one moms said i 'm not going let child make horrible mess floor went dinner well , 's impossible i literally picked 2 3 pieces food floor versus 40 pieces food i 'm pleased product 're finished , roll take home cleaning will recommend others 
+1	we used tiny diner placemat first time last night it worked great it gave place put 10 month old son 's food since n't use plates bowls despite best efforts , could not pull restaurant table i attached suction cups when fully rolled , gave us plenty room -- even typical goofing , food remained within confines mat yet rolled , 's size paper towel tube , fit easily diaper bag i felt little frivolous purchase i picked sort whim , i glad i ! we not dine without ! 
+1	we like take baby boy ( 13 months ) dining us sit high chair edge table my wife got cover restaurant high chairs , amazingly sticky , brings along clorox disinfecting wipes things within easy reach this flu season , , year 's swine flu 're talking well , try protect little guy , hands get table everything else within reach , head straight mouth , course this past week wife added kiddopotamus tiny diner place mat protective devices it fits strange tables encounter works well it works well home table well , emphasis different at home 's protection table , rather kid in either case , fastens small suction cups the little boy smear stuff easily peel mat give washing real handy it even little trough table-edge side catch inevitable spillage direction we chose blue , green would good we 're going get lot use nifty little accessory gary peterson 
-1	seems good quality , would n't stick wood dining table - i tried wetting suction still luck it 's sitting drawer since got 
-1	ugh , i start ? the thing complete crap the suction cups stick 5 seconds , since 's designed `` flaps '' fold , not unstick , different sections actually flip straight onto plate the pocket n't catch much food angled *towards table* instead towards kid the texture hard clean , 's also bulky i could n't imagine toting around restaurants , sticky plastic ones graphics cheaper , disposable , honestly much convenient i 'm still search good toddler placemat ! 
+1	this item great taking go -- restaurants , playdates , friend 's houses i n't worry plates thrown floor food getting potentially dirty table it sticks almost tables 've used difficult 15 month old pull -- though really wants it 's large enough cover nice size area still rolls easily material easy wipe take home washed but not dishwasher safe suction cups , 's like trying wash octopus kitchen sink i wish i could throw dishwasher , i understand wo n't work great material also , n't cut i made mistake easily cut mat 
-1	as reviewers said , item not stay flat -- comes folded box fold lines strong could n't `` unfolded '' ( n't not supposed happen silicone ? i think item silicone-rubber blend ) , made hard suction cups stick etc etc item not unfolding way flat unevenness caused large suction cups underneath , bottom line mat would not stay flat made impossible put sippy cup without cup falling ask frustrating baby likes flip everything anyway , items i expected stay upright falling constantly also , reviewers noted item sticks glass tabletops , means faced tablecloth not not stick uncompressed suction cups make nice uneven rolly playground baby 's utensils , foods , liquid fall roll around , nice messy ! i also want add one restaurant fancy wood tables , suction cups trouble sticking husband placed drop water underneath suction cup like recommend worked fine , except moisture-suction blend left marks table ! i n't think permanent damage , never know wood moisture 's one thing sorry restaurant : ( i bought one insteadnuk gerber graduates 100 % silicone platemat -- n't suction cups 's perfect it 's true silicone ( not silicone-rubber blend ) means retains flat shape matter and silicone-ness `` stickiness '' , enough keep mat sliding around the pic description shows rolled , i fold quarters store quart ziplock baggie diaper bag , perfect ! it actually ships folded anyway and edging ( tinydiner mat also not ) keeps spills escaping dropped food rolling onto icky restaurant table ca n't say enough good things nuk gerber silicone mat 
-1	this little mat rubber stoppers bottom hold the problem little stoppers n't work 
+1	i highly recommend this product i own one and use it all the time my toddler likes to put anything and everything in his mouth as any one would and this placemat helps make sure he only eats what is clean and has less bacteria it is also durable , flexible and easy to clean and once done , just roll it and put it away amazing 
+1	this one best inventions ! going eat , never know clean tables , i n't like thought food sitting whatever cleaning products used it wipes `` clean '' diaper wipe , well , clean enough roll back toss diaper bag without getting anything else dirty we bought second one always clean one hand i even get compliments waitstaff using gives less scrape ha , ha definately worth 
+1	the one down-side n't stick well table surfaces it works great , others suctions n't want stick anything ( even wetting suggested ) besides , great & # 34 ; plate & # 34 ; 18-mo old friends ' restaurants it rolls nicely cleans easily 
+1	we use tandem inglesina 2013 fast table chair , graphite love easy clean , provides clean surface eat , easy carry along with inglesina chair , handles keep sides place mat key without chair son would pull mat throw floor would useless the suction cups n't really anything , tandem fantastic 
-1	not happy product still pain clean kiddo still splash food drink placing storage month two mold started growing 
+1	this placemat great purchase ! i purchased use take 9 month old well received ! not cover table , catches food items son drops this quite handy unexpected benefit love son he runs hand , feeling textures 
+1	i 'm happy i took chance product ! i carry matt ( rolled ) basket stroller go case eat , always make sure take visit friends family it 's great clean surface put babies food not carry dishes us travel plus , matt ensures always clean surface baby 's food , makes cleaning leaving quick easy mealtimes 
+1	baby food expensive , able make instant baby food dinner plate awesome especially restaurants just wish i bag put dirty ziplock useful not reuseable it grinds foor well little effort , happy results beef , chicken , brocolli , noodles , appricots this affordable piece add baby arsenol 
+1	unlike many negative reviews , i happy item we use 2-4 times day 's effective easy use it requires strength push , really minimal takes less 2 minutes use one type food ( i 'm 120lbs little upper body strength ) i trouble [ ] it 's so easy first thing i going say i give good hot rinse i 'm done , food n't dry , not much else at night i wash ( bristle brush ) around rubber ring strainer part soap hot water could put dishwasher , n't yet i n't think needs it the reason i give 4 stars handle n't super sturdy it 's made plastic , n't caused problem yet ( 's 3 months old ) i ca n't imagine i 'll using grandchildren 20 years future [ ] 
-1	do not buy n't work waste money ! ! ! go buy food processor type food mill bc waste ! 
+1	this great little food mill baby food i 've used pretty much anything normally meals it grinds lumpy texture meant babies handle thicker bites food it n't puree super finely it 's perfect 10 month old i 've put rice , beans , well cooked veggies , green beans , crackers cheese blend together , spaghetti sauce , etc it 's simple use , easy wash travels well 's small it 's good on-the-spot meal making , not making large batches ( could would take ) it 's great supplement help making little guy 's daily meals 
+1	i would recommend product moms need way feed babies i slightly disappointed bowl part top n't circle shape , egg shaped 
-1	i high hopes food mill , purchased reading many reviews similar products i remember reviewer writing space grinding disk bottom plunger large fully collapsed ( push one piece push food towards grinding disks ) this exactly correct i tried puree small portion ( 1/2 pear ) nothing came except juice ! all fruit stuck disks since goal getting able puree small portions go good i returned it i gave two stars might work better pureeing larger portions components seem well made albeit poorly designed 
+1	this n't best babies 6months n't get foods smooth step 1 foods buy store but keeping mind this comes handy i started grinding foods 6 month old it easier grind food right table eat things eating , rather prepare store food advance i decided one n't enough i prefer run things dishwasher sterilized washing hand i tend use two meals day i n't like feel pressed load run dishwasher dinner it usually n't problem , things hectic times its also nice one clean traveling 
+1	this cheap great device i n't experience 'babyfood ' texture , certainly adaptable baby 's palate make sure feed baby water whilst eating anything grind 've tried everything fish , veggies , fruits ( ie watermelon , btw didnt work : ) works well , didnt get case ( dont need extra weight pack ) , pleased makes food quickly little noise ( baby hates food processor cried whenever ground something due noise ) simple assemble , diassemble , wash notes : diassemble every use completely ( ie separate grinder pieces wash , especially using food prone bacteria ) order 'open ' 'close ' grinding device solidly quickly grinder storage portion , make sure keep spoon handle nearby , loosen/tighten screw portion blade slide right cup slots i issue not really knowing food getting 'pureed ' grinding blades simply pushing mesh doesnt seem discussion anywhere found , know part correctly also watermelon turned fibered ( slightly ) watermelon juice , quite tasty ! also dont need spoon : ) found longer smaller spoon nicer actuallyfor solid babyfood feeding obviously not juicier ones like peaches apricot goes quite well probably want peel fruits veggies stick 
+1	i 've using couple months work great i one keep toddler couple closets he 's pretty strong n't pulled 
+1	here 's deal if kid wants somewhere bad enough enough time work , overcome safety features i put toddlers closet door keep after 6 months learned push weight one side pull side toward the glue 's job ! lock stayed place , one `` wings '' cracked it still job , figured this not really flaw product , toddler way sticking something

-1	i agree reviewers toy like serious potty training my daughter loves sticking hand bowl make play song loves taking bowl there times n't go music goes confusing i probably buy another one distinguish difference once figured could make play without going potty quit using 
+1	i used daughter the time leaked n't snapped right we never used music ( thinking would n't beneficial 'd want put toys make music go ) it lot easier clean potty chair there 's little 'trick ' ( call ) unsnap pulling instead pulling way once lightweight sturdy it back feels like real potty and problems sitting it obviously , never used pee guard ( easily removable ) 
+1	our daughter started fighting diapers 6-7 months old , fit desperation , i bought potty , put never looked back it helped potty really comfortable , wide , flat bottom left marks tush , stable enough accidents i give 4 stars i really could not snap seat toilet whole construction darn plasticky ah , music never worked ( loss opinion , i encouraging ) training book seemed bit cheesy a toddler may also entertain thoughts removing easily accessible container sitting , may lead whole new set problems but overall , potty made lives easy potty training , i not lavish praise little piece plastic ! 
-1	not buy potty chair simply `` bells whistles '' never seem work right time - half time i would liked see little deeper far size goes , boys little trouble squeezing protector the main thing annoys maybe happens boys , occasionally leaks underneath bowl slides i guessing since boys urine comes front , rather underneath , leaks space bowl slides there even times older son 's pants got wet resting front potty sat if i , i would opt using big potty start - cleaning things gets old fast ! 
+1	i say sassy makes best infant toys teething toys my son toys come pack loved , unfortunately son baby didnt sell one pack , buy seperately , buy pack save money 
+1	looking baby toys overwhelming this set need ( course 'll end buying toys , really need ! ) the toys high-quality , colorful , encourage exploration play i highly recommend set

+1	i happy total package there number things go various stages baby 's development , overall i beleive price works economical purchasing individual toys 
+1	item great putting tables fast food restaurants 
+1	i admit -- i 'm one `` '' parents wipes restaurant highchair table antibacterial wipes child sits i still even placemats , definitely make comfortable toddler eat restaurant tables we used countless restaurants quite pleased we found n't stick well tables , i suppose expected use care removing placemats wooden tables remove bit finish one table oopsie ! also , recent batch table toppers seems bit faulty -- sticky substance bottom edge placemats far edge mat -- leaving 1 5 inches loose placemat bottom mat tempting toddler tug ! ! we always buy daughter sesame street table toppers asks elmo zoe ready start eating restaurant such great invention definitely one i wish i thought ! ! : ) 
-1	my son also rips right table he almost 11 months old hopefully better older ( fortunately i bought 20 pack ) this great idea theory curious son not practical i back using antibacterial wipes clean table effective method i found far update : i recently found two alternatives concept worked well the local dollar tree sells version table toppers cling quite well ( pack 8 $ 1 ) hippopatamus brand target sells great educational themes abcs numbers 1-10 these wrap around edge table cover area previously reviewed brand 
+1	my son 17 months old saw last week friend 's house national building museum 's playroom kids these incredibly great ! he 4 happy !

+1	i wanted try boppy tired paying full price name-brand items might might not work ( first ) son my husband likes thing even i he helping midnight feedings expressed milk baby hurting back middle night now uses cuddle-u help secure son feedings there definite downsides , though : the cover not come , makes cleanings tricky some would surely consider worth pay removable cover also , i n't see growing little guy much it 's not secure enough support sitting position , i imagine 'll done 3-4 months for price , lasted long enough 
+1	i purchased pregnant i could not see spending $ 40 boppy i not able use nursing pillow bulky , i use tummy time son newborn he 10 months old i use play time , i plop , let crawl , etc i never used strap u shaped pillow already self-containing i n't know need strap ? anyway , pouch strap go son makes game pulling i tuck away overall , i like pillow i would recommend anyone interested boppy i say i purchased pillow wal-mart $ 20 brightly colored jungle theme , i not comment specific color/style sold amazon

-1	these feel like plastic they overriding plastic feeling i would even put baby they scratchy thin feeling i guess may good price , though i guess i ca n't speak if 's catching drool i find preference cloth bib i 'd rather change bib often let baby comfortable 
-1	i must admit i bought due price but get pay i kept due fact i use feeding normal use not feeding , bib always end face lying back ( not cause concern not getting air light material never seem cover babies nose mouth baby not get air ) starts moving hands sitting position it annoying parents baby i normally change bib feeding heavier cloth bib 
-1	i not expect bibs small i thought would standard bib size however small lengthwise 
-1	all fault when i read water resistant i assume 'd plastic ones easy wipe they not 
-1	not sure brest pillow tough put pillow it works 's hassle 
-1	poorly sewn cheap material since i love pillow i guess i stuck using covers being new mom time make cover ( i type one handed ! ) 
-1	i would suggest looking stores buying one person not internet i got thing baby shower gift registry -- twas quite small hard ! i glad didnt use 
-1	these seem sturdy long use product unfortunately couple design issues first , side flaps velcro molded way undo diaper instantly fall dirty diaper unless fold hold really tough screaming squirming baby this means enclosure area gets dirty easily ca n't reuse diaper many wears without washing secondly , material stains easily if n't want use bleach ( ca n't , gives baby rash ) , diapers look dirty even clean 
-1	there two major negatives car seat first , users stated , handle not move easily loud squeaky , nightmare sleeping baby second , adjust straps one way elongating top straps , not lengthen piece goes baby 's legs straps snap this huge problem baby grows , especially use `` bundle '' ( every mom i know uses cold climate ) baby wearing bulky clothing , cloth diaper my baby 18 pounds 27 inches 5 months baby already out-grown car seat reason i would loved able used winter , huge disappointment main reason i would never buy ! one last note , strap adjustment baby 's legs awkward try blindly thumb around get baby seat want tighten straps ! 
-1	this mat many pieces if get little one play , 'll forever putting together little bits pieces , likely choking hazards anyway get mat 's one piece 
-1	this one items looks good paper - re-configurable play mat goes together like puzzle the problem good teething toddler ! we bought item soften hard floors baby could roll around not hurt falls in respect , works well the problem however , soon figured could take pieces ( pretty quickly , way ) , became constant battle keep taking edges trying eat them the whole thing made lightweight foam , bitten could present choking hazard fortunately us not happened , vigilance part the smaller internals certain letters & numbers ( example , holes number 8 ) even worse so may good playmat 4 year old , it 's not good toddlers stick everything anything mouths if roll , one-piece version existed , i think i would purchase however 
-1	my son loves baby einstein dvds especially loves guy show excited find amazon however , n't work well puppet you ca n't open mouth easily we returned 
-1	while son drinking cup , part plastic spout meets lid comes apart leaks place 
-1	i boy , run around neon pink sport cup n't really cup tea , luckily sister beautiful baby girl love starts walking

-1	i purchased mattress wanted avoid nasty flame retardants price , even though quite high , still lower organic crib mattresses however , 1 month use decided return product amazon great refunding full amount pros : fits well criborganic without natural flame retardant barriercons : extremely heavy - husband even trouble changing sheets since i could n't allvery soft - even though says firm mattress , giving quite easily 10lb baby made dent middle would n't go away after one month ! cover deformed - waterproof cover seemed well made first one month use formation dent center cover started folds ( lack better word ) overall , i disappointed product i still looking reasonably priced mattress without frs last this not 
-1	it 's soft silky side , good size , cute i wish baby liked much i ; n't give attention one note , silky side snagged i 've washed 
-1	i really bummed hoping reviews not correct we use eco-friendly diapers ( the honest company ) biodegradable well wipes stoked found trash bags eco-friendly diapers unfortunately smell got much these really hold smell son 's room started smelling like diapers i love diaper dekor 've issues unless trash needed emptied ( overflowing ) started using i switched back old liners issue smell unfortunately tells something liners i sorry i ca n't recommend unless n't mind smell 
-1	maybe like later son 8 months heavy clunky even bite hard make vibrate 
-1	i purchased since baby moving around crib this thinner i thought would , compared thick crib bumper came crib set it easy install strong velcro ends however , i wishing i bought brand breathable crib bumper thin mesh breathablebaby bumper made slides easily crib slats i found baby arm leg crib slats , pushing mesh bumper , even bumper tied `` velcroed '' tight possible the thin material also not protect bumping head sides crib mainly crib bumper she still rolls hits head sides crib , waking crying ! i buying summer infant breathable bumper this one waste money i ca n't return i tossed packaging im going try convert something baby proof something house 
-1	it constantly slides she generally ca n't stick arms legs near bottom , stick bumper pull now 's pulling sides crib , frequently pulls ca n't get stay 
-1	the two main reasons wanted mesh bumper 1 ) son scoots around sleep bangs head bars sometimes 2 ) gets limbs caught slats this brand i could find time i needed i think tried make end-all safe crib bumper , made fail for example , 's supposed fit every type crib , two pieces instead one for us , means i ca n't get tight enough around crib then 's fact weave corners , instead tying like traditional one this leaves two slats back corners inside crib one front side of course means son 's banging sleep the designers n't want kids able stand , `` collapses '' fancy 's nothing tension holding thing my son throw arm leg collapse whole thing then gets arm leg stuck the soft side goes outside , away baby , little confusing you ca n't see baby 're like playyard , would nice bottom line : i wish one flimsy ribbon ( 's not even pair , one bottom ) could little securely attached crib i wish not weave into crib but mostly i wish son n't outsmarted 5 minutes i 'd washed gotten 
-1	when i pregnant shopping nursery , i torn type bumper buy one one hand i liked softness carter 's brand bumper , i liked `` breathable '' bumper daughter born beginning summer i wanted stay cool possible ; i bought breathable bumper when i put crib , looked nice daughter little imobile , useful as soon began roll around , 4 months , i would wake night screams litttle arms legs would get caught spacing crib , bumper ! she would roll turn sleeping apparently limbs would lift bumper bumper would crumble light pressure babies arm i since bought carter 's brand bumper i happy it stands limbs limbs get caught great idea , bumper needs work 
-1	i wanted badly end , but , putting together , i realize n't long enough cover entire crib and standard crib that disappointing then , realized bumper provides little padding baby hits head inevitable 're learning sit even , 're learning roll wiggle crib it 's unfortunate , i 'm thinking buying regular crib bumper sometimes good ole traditional items still best ! 
-1	these bumbers not work us my 15 month old started getting legs/feet stuck rods crib i hoping would prevent getting stuck unfortunately bumbers totally flimsy kick they also constantly slide i 've tried several times tighten within day back slack sliding would not recomend 
-1	after reading baby books warn crib bumpers ( potential suffocation , etc ) , i eventually opted breathablebaby kind i knew purchasing would n't soften blows caused baby turning bumping head , i expect fit stay baby 's crib properly as fit , length two bumper panels slightly small fit around entire crib , i made work since baby 's crib wall therefore i n't need use panels anyway no problem solving , however , managed keep bumper sliding crib slats outfitted two center ties ( one panel ) , bumper simply not adequately stay it forever sliding ( even without help infant son , yes , constantly touched sucked fabric ) since i got bumper only keep son 's legs getting crib slats stuck , i found better solution : i make sure son 's always wearing sleep sack ( sleep sacks come various weights year-round wearing ) , prevents feet going slats first place the bumper attractive enough ; not functional 
-1	i always subscribed aap 's recommendation bare best comes crb bedding but son started pulling crib constantly getting legs feet stuck rails so i ordered keep limbs safely crib i easily installed really look sharp stylish however i n't think looked like would still allow air circulation i used 3of son 's naps every time i got nap sweating flushed that let know air n't circulating normal so i took returned without issue i guess i nervous nelly i friends use without problem it 's not us 
-1	this help keep baby 's limbs inside crib sleeping , not help 's ratings extra cushion he 's woken many times since 've bumper i 'm sure feel 's hitting head something instead nice cushioned bumper i watched youtube video correct installation 's pretty easy , continues droop hour less the railings weird placement compared ties hold top definitely not fan product 
-1	maybe crib smaller cribs not sure all i know thing waste money i nice pottery barn bumper son started rolling around crib started rolling near sides i bought breathable bumper since scared sids i snuza monitor video monitor i total spaz however , i bummed bumper n't hold baby my husband i tightened bumper several occasions son able push feet bumper manage get feet leg stuck crib after many nights son crying leg stuck crib , i reluctantly put old bumper back since putting back , baby i slept better i think theory bumpers good not hold baby likes put feet everything 
-1	i well aware hype surrounding bumpers i respectfully disagree these & # 34 ; breathable & # 34 ; ones super flimsy n't even fit crib- loose bulky- yes standard crib also witness baby hitting head these- 'll go right back regular bumpers ! just monitor baby fine 
-1	we never able keep crib liner stable one position since made nylon/synthetic material , doesnt stay one place it always slips bottom did n't like 
-1	i originally purchased traditional crib bedding set included cute bumper , reading unsafe searching alternatives i came across product the useful thing keep pacifier baby 's crib every time dropped middle night it 's barely padded order breathable , n't keep baby bumping head rails it also n't keep limbs getting stuck rails it collapses easily ( babies not climb ) , order safe , defeats bumpers ' purpose : keep limbs getting stuck protect heads hitting wood we currently not using anymore bumpers not safe , i 'd rather go free arms legs console accidentally hits head , also without mesh not anything ! ! ! i really wanted like waste money 
-1	i heard lot good things bumper really wanted work i not want use standard bumper thought would perfect since boasted suffocation risk tested well , received mail today , eagerly put crib n't fit , way shape form not fit extremely awkwardly around posts , left odd gaps , main thing n't even long enough go around whole thing this really good idea safe bumper , not practical clearly n't fit cribs 
-1	while concept great , design not i n't like leave bars crib exposed order fit tightly around crib i n't like fact daughter barely able move , able move bumper get legs stuck bars they n't put ties throughout bumper supposedly safety reasons , i think needed order keep bumper place better i 've bumper week less returning save money get something else 
-1	almost nothing fits bottom portion , include nipples , utensils it either n't fit falls opening overall i think open basket without bottom portion would effective useful 
-1	i soooooo wanted love booster seat yes , looks nice but i two main issues:1 the quality foam seat not good i ordered one seat saw defects foam - little holes back seat , defects foam so i ordered replacement thing there tiny tiny raised pieces foam seat , i could see going snag peel wiping times ( white foam would show underneath ) 2 it weird gap foam seat base you ca n't take completely , lift inches not impressed 
-1	when i pregnant i went crazy bought everything i thought i could possibly need i chicco keyfit son younger britax neither needed product they came similar products attached son never one spit car not like i needed clean lot some cheaper carseats may need i think already covered 
-1	i impression would make baby comfortable strap covers made strips bulkier bothersome : baby not like 
-1	i got bedding weeks ago registry i got crib assembled i put bedding wash gentle ( directed ) mild baby soap well , blanket tore 4 places i 'm 34 weeks pregnant , i n't even used set 's falling apart plus skirt not wide enough cover whole rail big gaps sides i 'd return , i already washed very disappointed 
-1	i normally n't take time write reviews case i felt i needed share experience my bumper literally fell apart , ties completely detached bumper overall not keep shape do n't buy set i really wanted work , i love look quality really lacking 
-1	i thought would bigger i spent $ 10 ! but 's small ! fits 7 month olds hand i thought would large carrot rattle 's small i n't check size specs still , $ 10 i expected something 
-1	they really cheap looking 's not issue they stained first time i used i 'm going buy others 
-1	the spoon tip turns white food could described anything warmer luke warm for beginner babies appropriate temperature however , spoon sensitive , ended feeling hands every time anyway

-1	after solely breastfeeding baby 3 months , husband i wanted able go babysat in order get take bottle , many tries fails , finally found nipple would take , unfortunately one n't he kept spitting wanted nothing !

-1	i coming year pumping work second pump ( first lansinoh lost suction heavy use ) i spent time cursing pump loving when i second kid i probably invest different pump first , suction terrible way i could get enough suction actually get milk i pump one side plugging loose tube manually thumb instead plugging socket available one-sided pumping if i plug like recommended manual instead physically holding tube closed , suction terrible i actually hear air escaping my co-worker pump swears ca n't pump i wonder problem suction not n't let pump i also end lot milk leaking i 'm not careful if lean forward , forget , clothes done i poured ounces milk lap , chair work , floor my office probably smells like dairy farm anyway i finally figured out there features i like pump , gets two stars instead one : size great battery life great hands-free good idea , i n't suction problems also like wear , truly hands-free except suction leakage problems ! quiet enough work small enough take everywhere -- i hung coat hook jacket conference , etc i like storage bottles ice pack okay , i might reaching medela , fix suction problems ! 
-1	a weeks first baby due i ordered freestyle pump little i know i going disappointed sooner rather later the freestyle pump great theory falls short expectations as new mom i n't know long would take pump unfortunately , like reviews pump inadequate suction it takes 30 plus minutes pump fraction milk i pump either hand pump electric pump on note , i would recommend medela harmony hand pump one tenth expense i sorry i wasted much money device not work the worst part pump not returnable like many others i feel i stuck lemon product 
-1	i excited upgrade pump really happy old pump-in-style ( still works like new 2 years heavy use 2 years storage -- i wanted one home office ) , i disappointed see many disadvantages comparison : motor pump makes really odd annoying sound , bottle attachment n't fit glass bottles leaked ( pump-in-style 's fit fine ) , attachments help make & # 34 ; hands free & # 34 ; pump complicated flimsy 're not worth i returned got new pump-in-style , i 'm happy even better old model , 's light-weight less bulky and i use hands-free time strategically placing bottles i pump in opinion , pump definitely not worth extra money i would hate pumping idea breast pump like 
-1	i motor replaced 3 months using 3x per day the pump stopped working ( output gradually got lower barely pumping anything ) the new motor worked well another month ( n't supply pump ) i loosing suction so i replaced motor , spare parts kit twice , hose when i received new motor , output immediately went back , going again i running stuff replace pump even though i love size convenience hands free , bottom line since suction starts get weak months , not worth it i contacting company again ( ugh ) try get pump style advanced my recommendation , hold getting this hands free looks nice , overall quality pump lacking and not mention , cleaning spare parts every night kit exhausting yet another issue i pump bottom line : pump not hold full time use ( i 've using 7 months - 3 months 3x per day ) update : since i 've written review , i get pump running well i however contact medela decided second time around send new motor new battery when replaced pump started working like charm of course i not say long newly replaced parts would last since i stopped pumping little guy 3 months later however , , i able successfully pump total 15 months freestyle ( thanks determination diligence performance pump ) i able pump everywhere car , plane , room lunch break , bathroom ( i know yuck ) conference i would n't able easily bigger/bulkier pump however , i n't think moms use reason alone deciding factor getting pump it way huge pain keep supply suction got weak , caused lot unnecessary anxiety , hassle i 'm therefore stearing new moms away model at least , make sure backup pump fails , still go work , wait another pump get shipped , 'll find bind i call sick several times happened i not anticipate problems , stuck w/out pump way feed child

-1	yes , seems comfy , i feel better using plastic/vinyl sheet obvious reasons but i n't really consider waterproof fortunately daughter 's first year 've leakage problems night , first time diaper fail , i removed sheet discover `` waterproof '' pad wet there n't huge leak , either , daughter 's cloth diaper slipped cover wicked moisture , jammies , onto sheet but pad still not prevent mattress getting wet maybe helps minor things , drool whatnot simply providing bulk sheet mattress , i would n't count anything major really wish i better things say

-1	you could probably make salt dough save money instead buying product i not impressed 
-1	the stroller image shown jake higher priced g-luxe model , not g-lite this model not recline , smaller black wheels , not fold footrest infants this listing incorrect , hopefully correct soon show actual item receive 
-1	does not get tough stains great toddler doesnt spill/play dirt kids like mine , filthy end day wont cut 
-1	would not purchase they loud buzz came nowhere we often ran room find nothing trigger sound 
-1	we purchased , found pop crackle loudly evening , point i turn they worked well enough first year , 12 months , speakers must blown we ca n't use anymore 
-1	bottom line not worth money - interference feedback way much - even house houses nearby also noise alert sensitivity function - every time baby makes peep turns - anyone newborn tell means going every 10 seconds the bottom line want monitor lets decide want hear not let buy avent instead great sensitivity function slightly money 
-1	i really disappointed monitor wish i retained box return could made i using four months relatively small home , range terrible the initial receiver located living area ( feet baby 's room ) location good reception however , second receiver room 20 feet away one wall there devices located near receiver yet gets almost reception we tried moving around room ( close possible babies unit ) nothing works also , apparent failure pattern would help us determine cause problem it simply works little discernible reason begins sound range signal my advice pass one 
-1	we using baby monitor almost 8 months at first thought going good fit us it seemed almost sensitive noises , red lights would flash baby rolled crib but `` range '' light would flash would intermittently beep it would n't beep consistently though , seemingly night the clicks , pops crackles horrendous wake us frequently with baby sleeping night often resort turning monitor night , completely defeating purpose almost 8 months use not picking babies noises well i hear baby wall monitor picks sounds we tried multiple channels try get rid interference nothing seems help about chuck monitor replace something work do n't waste money , read reviews carefully go something else 
-1	i not buy monitor amazon we purchased 2008 reason stopped picking stations it not last year i another baby april i pulled thing trying see i could get work i tried kinds color combinations luck i looking another monitor looks like vtech may one i n't know thing supposed work ca n't get channel matter placed house it never dropped anything never sony opinion failed one 
-1	after buying returning three different monitors tried sony babycall a couple friends recommended running options the sound monitor pretty good analog signal the problem range alarm ( really loud , annoying beeping ) kept randomly going walked around house we single floor home n't huge there way receivers actually range we tried exchanging sony babycall another unit hoping gotten faulty one , second one even worse first ! i could n't even leave receivers beeped non-stop it could many devices operating analog signal work us , analog monitors not problem do n't bother sony babycall 
-1	when i picked monitor , i expected high quality sony name higher price i liked one two receivers wanted put one basement one upstairs master rather always trying keep track receiver we replacing 6 months the major disappointments : - constant interference no matter channel set , seems like slightest noise may cause interference this annoying every time receiver loses signal millisecond beeps this lot beeping trying sleep -- something new parent n't want lose technology the monitor beeps least 5-6 days week middle night wakes us up - volume sensitivity the volume sensitive we try not ever adjust difficult get adjusted low enough ca n't hear baby breathing , clock ticking things n't need hear distracting trying sleep if someone adjusts volume even least week get tweaked right twice woken see red visual lights full blast hear baby screaming floor thanks sony putting worthless product market i wish 'd packed first days returned we kept thinking another channel would solve interference problems never 
-1	it okay would loud feedback everytime got within proximity cell phone could hear tick second hand clock device fairly sensitive the automatic sound activation always kind questionable however , one receivers suddenly stopped working 11 months - warning anything indicate stopped working indicator lights still the fact could stop working suddenly kind disturbing , potentially dangerous 
-1	i n't even know begin - basically , horrible car seat i would like slap ever falling bells whistles swivel/dock feature orbit proud i recommend stay away orbit , toddler car seat particular your wallet thank save headache if feel like reading , go ahead we orbit baby g2 travel system ( frame , base , infant car seat ) felt somehow trapped thought since already expensive base get orbit toddler car seat put use ( 12-month old baby getting big infant seat ) unfortunately , unable see toddler car seat person retailer seems floor model thing i hesitant order online went store hoping would able take box examine functions i n't sure whether recline function ( orbit website not mention function ) so went told shop not floor model ( surprise ) box not opened so i asked questions assured reassured , indeed , recline comfortable position accommodate babies small toddlers we paid almost $ 400 ( $ 360 + nyc tax ) brought thing home discovered does not recline ! ! ! i furious i asked 3 different sales persons assured recline every convertible car seat market reclining function , especially price point and frankly , almost $ 600 ( $ 360 seat + $ 220 base ) recline automatically i say `` recline '' the seat upright i not understand orbit says designed babies 15 pounds ! no way my son 15 pounds 3 5 months old there absolutely no way 3-month old baby would ever comfortable upright position ca n't even sit actually , n't upright position early ! i tested seat 12-month old son weighs 22 pounds measures 31 inches ( btw , infant car seat babies 30 pounds 32 inches , 's 1 inch away , frankly , 's not comfortable anymore ) do think 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby comfortable new toddler car seat ?

-1	i looking carseat new , third , baby i owned combi infant seat graco snugride past i wanted buy something new stylish , one three compatible 2010 uppababy vista peg offered numerous stylish fabric varieties , i thankful gracos everywhere chicco ( third compatible infant seat ) ugly patterns so i decided find store sold peg see reviews right let tell this- heavy not word describe seat i fit , pretty strong , lifting i could not even imagine ever wanting carry around anymore added weight it felt like graco combi felt exactly i decided move kids carriers toddler seats for new parents , very very important ! strollers snap gos not used everywhere , even though convenient easy there times will carry seat picking something someone 's house , visiting people , carrying house , carrying church , etcetc anyway , i n't want anyone make mistake i know heavy reinforced , nice , not practical 
-1	though tommee tippee bottles fit warmer , i unable secure & # 34 ; lid & # 34 ; goes around bottle i would not suggest warmer people using bottles 
-1	we stopped using thing 2 weeks got no matter amount water used , bottle came scalding hot every time then 15-minute wait bottle cool enough give baby -- last thing want urgently hungry baby verge meltdown we quickly learned faster/safer warm bottle container warm water wait boiling bottle cool safe temperature we use dr brown glass bottles , i wondered anything -- chart included bottle warmer showed necessary water amounts glass well plastic , excuses a worthless lump plastic counter 
-1	pretty much garbage used two weeks light went beeping stopped-but still heated bottles inconsistently heats bottles , also would n't bad except feature keeps turning n't heat supposed three minutes according manual anywhere 3 8 minutes common scenario-the baby starts fuss hungry put bottle warmer , checking often light beeping indicate done check bottle still cold baby starts cry add water warmer , alas turned wait restartable baby starts scream still waiting , 8 minutes restart warmer wait another minutes bottle warm takes almost long heat bottle feed boiling water son 2 months old it also heated pacifiers made smell like burnt rubber ( sterilization bags never ) 
-1	after reading reviews , i decided try product anyway the sound beep n't bother , bedroom fairly removed kitchen the problem i product really overheats bottle ! even though i followed guidelines instructions , milk always waaay hot , i ended needing cool ice in words , would taken much time float bottle thermos hot water i would n't recommend product anyone 
-1	you 're better adding $ $ $ getting really good one , like dr browns warmer , wich i done since i use brand bottles , etc i made mistake buying one month later i get dr browns one , like say get pay , 's exactly happens warmer wich not consistent , forms nasty build difficult remove not even vinager beeping loud ! worth even try , i got one cause i love things brand , bottle cooler wich amazing i must say , drying rack , containers powder formula go , wipes warmer i think best one , etc bottle warmer need improve lot other pacifier sterilizer pretty good idea 
-1	this item works inconsistently when first got tested water setting see needed bottles it warmed properly 2 times , 3rd time not heat way up i increased amount water used `` steam '' bottle it worked 2 times , not heat bottle this pattern kept going needed `` measuring '' container held heat 3 oz bottle i n't want know would take heat 8 oz bottle ! baby waiting eat impatiently steam steam bottle , never knowing much water put changes / increases use product this problem safety feature product not allow steam 2nd time without unit first cooling , takes least 4-5 minutes i not recommend 
-1	i saw posts dried i took chance rather dried i added water got adequate hand prints thank cards 
-1	i took chance product despite negative reviews 's cheapest baby pad amazon it 's others mentioned , really dry faint i able get pair light somewhat acceptable footprints baby book some tips : 1 ) add water rehydrate pad , 2 ) kind drag baby 's foot pad rather trying press harder bonus tip : 3 ) mess print baby book ( daughter stepped right heel twice ) , take soft white eraser , use paper first make sure 's clean not smudgy , able lighten mistake 
-1	the good thing ink color i used washable marker this stuff smears easy i couldnt get good print wont come anything , clothes hands i would think twice using

-1	i purchased nuby nipple replacement bottle i never used i 'm not sure works assume works fine 
-1	if enjoy causing pain order feed baby , product ! if not , go sassy model opening closing extremely difficult 
-1	when placed nipple nipple collar supposed prevent leakage little bit , not degree i would use take liquid bottles i use i premake bottle premeasured powder formula n't add water yet i put premeasured water another bottle use travel caps liquid do not buy unless plan using like i 
-1	bottles definitely seemed help daughter 's colic , drive us nuts first , measurements tiny extremely difficult read - nipple flow indicators i twins different flows hard tell apart - especially middle night second , bottles leak badly i followed instructions several bottles , drip terribly you need wash hands arms feeding kid , n't travel well , even little disks provide stop leakage lastly , caps bottles longer standard bottles , forget fitting bottle holders , coolers , standard diaper bag bottle pockets i actually n't mind parts ; bottles worse 
-1	we got trying avent , medela , nuk , breastflow others i thought i found answer son 's excessive gas/acid reflux bottles seemed reacted right away burping less feedings however , week so- i noticed leaking a lot leaking this includes glass bottles plastic i tried taking apart , reassembling , making sure nipple pressed way , unscrewing lid , tightening lid , switching parts nothing i pump exclusively fill bottles after work pumping , cleaning parts cleaning setting dr brown parts- last bs i want deal leaking ! it leaks much wrap towel around bottles feeding ! i 'm not happy i 've spent $ 25 dr brown 's bottles happen i just threw away packaging , course ! i wish i could return get money back i however , love warmer dr brown that excellent product by way , 're baby `` colic '' look acid reflux 1 5 babies it- supposedly drs think colic actually stomach acid burning baby 's esophagus does baby arch his/her back get fussy meals lay backs ? you do something pain there thing `` colic '' 
-1	i stupidly went bought bunch bottles baby born , people recommended bought 2-pack tried making investment i thought large amount parts due vent system would annoying , actually turned not much issue , since bottles come apart really easily the main problem bottles leak constantly , matter literally , i would fill bottle ( not past max fill line ) , start feed baby , see leaking like crazy bottle rim wiping son , i 'd go pick bottle literally see streams milk continuing leak rim thing standing vertically tried tightening bottle rim , failed , tried loosening - nothing worked at least i say certainty not defective issue one pack bottles , since least 15 all in addition , plastic soft 'd leak even squeezed bottle accident 're tall fit many sterilizers just plain annoying every angle we finally chucked switched born free bottles , 100 % awesome i seriously n't understand hype dr brown 's bottles - i n't think `` special vent system '' better bottle 's , i actually think vent system causes leaking do n't waste money ! 
-1	my son incredibly colicky gassy newborn tried many different bottle types - dr brown , first years breast flow , tommee tippee , name the dr brown 's came highly recommended friends doctor 's nothing help little guy actually made gassier not not really said , also pain clean put back together these bottles many parts hassle worth overall , waste money us not bottle i would recommend we discovered tommee tippee 's stay duration ! 
-1	we using tommy tippee bottles daughter first born almost immediately throwing entire bottles my doctor actually suggested us moving dr brown 's bottles would n't ya know ! the throwing stopped instantly washing problem 2 mechanicals besides bottles wash order get adequately clean , really hand no big deal , i spend 20 extra minutes day washing components bottles hand ( even though dish washer safe ) now biggest problem bottles - leak sometimes reason this morning i put bottle nightstand half full , not tipped not bothered , next time i picked give 11 month old got doused milk this happens almost daily basis every day infuriates i yell `` i hate these bottles ! ! ! `` i really tried different bottles like avent keep colic throwing , reason leaky , messy , pain ^ @ ( # & ) @ ) # bottles seem ones keep throwing so , i willing put long enough little tummy n't hurt move sippy cups soon gets hang them i hate these bottles ! ! arrrrgggggg ! 
-1	i ordered 8 sets wife , since first 4 rubber seal ( middle ) started shrinking warping 4 months this almost caused issue feeding baby since wife first thinking output just warned seals ( ca n't purchased ) very high failure rate especially warm water ( dishwasher , steaming hot dishwater ) causes shrink/warp if check reviews , notice similar reviews when contacted medela , less confirmed issue they really sell seals separate unit since plastic pieces well 
-1	not sure i expecting , literally like dog leash no stretch elastic just nylon cord loop wrist one end my main complaint end -- takes work make workable loop fastener just slipping child 's wrist wo n't work , i wanted use around belt loop , tricky make happen very , basic 
-1	i thought would good idea use since son loves walk , i could n't get nerve put the strap looked ruff would cause redness wrist 
-1	i looking spoon little one i thought would amazing , i extremely disappointed the rubber attached spoon coming apart when got i washed i washed i inspected noticed rubber one already peeling back metal i not even use i n't feel safe baby ; rubber already peeling back n't even used yet , going happen spoons used time ? i n't think safe purchase instead i went another plastic spoon ; not i looking safer option 
-1	i used spoons son 's first `` solid '' foods because first foods liquid solid , spoons shallow hardly held anything hit baby 's mouth these wo n't last long hold less food per spoonful deeper spoons the lip so soft rounded use spoon catch dribble baby 's chin/face , actually smears pushes around rather scooping back ( buy multicolored munchkin spoons soft , wipe food baby 's face better , hold , thus lasting longer child starts eating volume chunkier foods ) 
-1	as far quality goes fine n't easy product use compared brands they short n't comfortable parents use also due length also messy dip jar bowl tend get food halfway spoon they also shallow making difficult feed runny first foods babies need go nuby great ! 
-1	compared baby spoons , handle shorter spoon much shallow - meaning n't hold much food tends lot spillage prefer munchkin ones 
-1	stupid purchase these pads feel scratchy breasts i wear lot wool , even undershirts , wool ok hand it would fine sweater pressed breasts not comfortable they n't seem absorb well either , milk dries solidifies pad , need washed periodically i think small piece old flannel pillowcase would better ( absorbent ) 
-1	really want work i read many positive reviews , sre simply good i put immediately fifth baby they felt great ! soft , warm , natural feeling looking then milk came my husband thinking building ark save us flood coming shirt ! the pads leaked thru the pads leaked around edges milk literally dripping chest lay bed nursing sweet baby when removed pads , expected saturated no just spot directly nipple so , not pads leak thru , somehow repelled milk shunted bra , hence milk dripping across chest i decided give pads another go milk supply stabilized engorgement resolved well , pads leaked manner first feed i emailed company not respond so , since foolishly bought two pairs plus lanolin soap 'm $ 60 
-1	i wish i n't purchase nursing pads they expensive , i thought i 'd finally find nursing pads work well overnight use however , i leaked gigantic wool pads i used overnight instead milk spreading whole nursing pad , leaked right pad dry except one spot milk leaking on top not comfortable they bulky not soft -- made itchy i tried washing wool soap curing lanolin like i wool diaper covers , still not perform well i finally end finding something soft absorbent enough handle nighttime leaking -- washcloths ! too bad i n't figure buying 
-1	i guess 's fault not reading size however `` elegant baby plush microfiber blankie - hot pink '' leads believe buying blanket baby , not baby doll 
-1	i guess 's fault not reading dimensions buying , much smaller looks pictures 
-1	it 's cute 's soft 's really small it thought like regular sized baby blanket 's like lovey sized blanket if 's 're looking would great , not i 'd look elsewhere 
-1	the term 'blanket ' not accurate description here it 's far small used blanket - i use burp cloth ( covers shoulder ) it looks like rushed-job creative department someone 's kitchen table neither plush elegant missed opportunity ! ! 
-1	so high hopes swim diaper our son 18 5lbs wears m unfortunately , m not fit well , gets saggy day accident wading pool voila everything came diaper it not contain anything if looking something elastic around legs something fits snug try finis swim diaper iplay supposedly work better one not cut us 
-1	we really hoped 'd like swing , came highly recommended several friends unfortunately , though , seems like lot marketing hype , needless bells whistles ( sound , hanging toys , like ) , absence quality swinging mechanism this may well true fisher price models `` designs `` this swing loud ( though may dealing 2 defects , local display model not loud ) , highly sensitive whether not perfectly level -- problem 're carpet pile after first unit made terrible grinding noise box , would not swing well , obtained replacement while replacement would run , would not run consistently it 's frustrating 're trying deal screaming newborn swing wo n't get going 3 a m patience thin ( the voices inside new-parent head may ask : `` can i ? i ca n't stop crying , i ca n't even make simple swing work ! `` ) other negatives consider : you 're dealing 4 d batteries ( , ac option ) , need use phillips-head screwdriver ( 4 screws ) swap there swings offer ac option pros : you rotate get swinging left right front back the fisher price assembly instructions decent , included hex tool required assembly in end , opted different brand if , however , opt swing ( one similar fp mechanism ) save the box case find wits end 
-1	first , weight limit swings reads 25 lbs my son 16 lbs ( full 9 lbs weight limit ) , swing n't move even highest setting the motor obnoxiously loud , made constantly loud clicking noises there way swing could sooth baby , let alone rock baby sleep my son 3 minutes , wanted we tried swing without son , worked ; however , tried 8 lb weight , stopped moving my husband i bought swing intending use month ( longer possible ) 6-month-old use new baby found 're instead , 's going right back box returned if eating expensive batteries downfall product , i might given extra star by way , get swing together , 's royal pain get undone back box looks like i 'm headed baby store look better product/ one actually works 
-1	i registered swing son one non-feminine swings i could find i thought cute & gender neutral i extremely disappointed the motor joke 's worse , exchanged & problems i know n't one bad swing the motor loud enough thought broken first tried , 's worse barely power swing 12 pound son literally , i leave swing , swings one inch either way son & half recommended weight capacity even newly born ( 8 lb 's ) , barely swung so i sit swing & push manually also , recline not flat enough newborn son 's head rolls forward & slumps chair matter i not would i not buy swing , product recalls i 've seen news , i 'd reluctant purchase anything fisher-price future 
-1	i bought swing i read great reviews , i found noisy i thought maybe motorhead defective i called fisher price sent new one , new one noisy it makes horrible creaking sound turn swing also , legs not sturdy i placed every surface house ( tile , wood , carpet , rug ) not found single surface works well the minute i turn legs start wobble needless say , i stopped using swing a friend gave another fisher price swing daughter used one fine , different model i would recommend fisher price swing definitely not my little lamb model 
-1	my husband i purchased first daughter the swing cute super soft however , made terrible clicking humming noises i not talking normal `` motor '' type noises , i talking loud obnoxious noises it sounded though working double time swing ( baby involved ) so put weight see would help , nope we thought maybe n't put together correctly , nope right so returned got another guess ? ! ? the new swing made exact noises ugh ! i give decided cuteness factor not outweigh loudness swing we returned got bright starts ingenuity swing absolutely silent cute ! ! 
-1	i got swing good friends used ~3 months baby girl they n't love swing , worked adequately hoping not purchase swing since point started using , never worked looking new swing the first issue wo n't start swinging stationary position , push get started it also n't keep swinging , give little push every stops moving ( we little baby , 6 weeks 8 lbs ) once get started , noisy it n't quite noisy get swing going rate motor trying swing swing , takes lot practice patience even , motor still makes lot noise of course motor n't thing makes ton noise , frame squeaks if get leg spacing right , get screws correct level tightness ( not way tight ) , put place ca n't move swinging , n't worry normal human nearly impossible feat then battery issue things sucks batteries we get 2 weeks battery use 4 d batteries of course second week turn sound mobile n't enough power music plays slow motion ( you remember record playing back wards sounds like ? it 's kinda like i 'm sure satanic message hidden thing somewhere ) -*-*-*-*-*-very important update-*-*-*-*-*-ok , two occasions child almost fallen swing the first time i thought maybe fluke i needed adjust straps better i made sure everything tightened appropriately the second time horrible thing i ever seen life somehow child wiggled swing ended face face butt rest body hanging bottom swing the thing holding strap around head could hung i would seriously consider finding swing 5 point harness system , least nice deep bucket seat child ca n't easily wiggle 
-1	our baby really loves swing used swing daily at first seemed `` ok '' bothered noise motor quite loud furthermore , ac adapter takes lot d batteries for us , seemed go quickly expected the stroller frame rocked bit not perfectly stable although not seem real risk tipping it quite big , move around house bit struggle there multiple setting swing i didnt notice much difference highest swing setting lowest the music options swing not great didnt like unfortunately , despite one expensive options , swing proved unreliable first sound went , motors went 3 months use , nothing elevated baby bed we replaced swing portable bright starts swing half price there ac adapter either , takes c batteries seems work longer without battery change the bright starts swing simple set-up folds quite compactly jiffy we move around house frequently take us car traveling baby enjoy the music better , timer , swing motor whisper quiet furthermore , reliable date , problems we overall displeased fisher price swing , even broke , comparison , bright starts swing superior 
-1	we got cradle swing gift unfortunately return , horrible screeching noise motor making it also seemed like motor weak ( 's really tiny ) we tested weight , noise horrible seemed like swinging motion slowed ( vs empty swing ) even though batteries brand new also , ca n't plug outlet i n't really know cradle swing pick ( especially seems like my little lamb best rating available swings market ) , since according reviews making kind noise 
-1	i little annoyed fisher price swing we found original swing ( fisher price cradle swing little snugabunnyto indispensable buy one grandparents ' house , for something different , chose swing rather snugabunny , also fisher price this swing battery operated noisier - something i noticed product description , annoying nonetheless but , importantly , considerably smaller it 's not something noticed first , baby grew , realized quickly getting far big unsafe swing , fit comfortably both swings say `` newborn 25lbs , '' not true 10 months later , packed swing two months ago , snugabunny still fits perfectly - godsend developed cold needed sleep upright do n't `` save '' dollars buying cheaper swing last months it 's cheaper end get

-1	after reading many positive reviews site , i bought joovy kooper ( appletree color ) i really disappointed using stroller past month it 's not worth price tag reasons stroller returned : * terrible for tall peoplefirst , stroller handles not tall i 'm 5'6 '' i pushed , shin would kick big red button middle ( button step open stroller ) i also found hunched pushing my son 's grandfather , barely 6 foot , would kick stroller walking i 'm not sure anyone would think stroller great tall people * wheels lock upthe front wheels lock and yes , i did check make sure n't inadvertantly locked ( n't ) three wheels would spin , one would n't - impossible steer 25 lb kid the wheel would n't turn would almost collapse stroller pushed , causing frame bend this main reason return , i ca n't see stroller lasting three years , son strollers * 5 point harness stinkswhile i think reflectors shoulder stap covers look cool , prevent straps tightened properly , son would shrug straps altogether this would n't problem chest clip , could keep straps stop little houdinis escaping this particularly concern tray/bar lap , kid fall * canopy is n't all it 's cracked up to bethe canopy is large but n't really clip well , every time i opened stroller i snap back side not huge deal , except son year old ca n't sit back canopy huge folded back , ca n't see if grew another inches , i 'd remove canopy altogether , would wrapped around head , like big floppy hat it 's great idea , poorly executed *not quite compactthe stroller n't small umbrella stroller collapse i knew looking video youtube , n't surprise the stroller not lay flat , front wheels it takes considerably less space trunk ( i toyota camry ) graco quattro ( i love ) , still space hog *impossible strap to lock/openi hate plastic strap use `` lock '' basically push head screw plastic strap hole one side ( side secured bar stroller ) order keep stroller closed position it impossible open strap one-handed open stroller i push stroller together strap loose , i fiddle get screw head i know common feature strollers , must better way also , stroller locked , front wheels still turn , ca n't lean wall things i did like : i liked color design except n't mean much i 'd struggling push thing mall ( talking totally flat , even ground ) the cup holders okay i managed put medium sized fountain soda cup one most umbrella strollers n't even cup holders loved inside pockets when son would pull socks , i 'd tuck inside pockets , along toys etc this neat feature there zipper pouch , cool place tuck digital camera phone especially nice since n't room large diaper bag underneath storage overall , i think stroller looks wonderful useful features , n't work properly i tried month , first uses fantastic , wheels actually show lot wear ( n't use stroller often ) front wheel kept sticking ( i tried locking unlocking solve problem , n't ) i really wanted stroller work i 'm disappointed didn't my son year old , ca n't come tell thinks joovy kooper , would cry time i mainly , i think canopy would bother , blocked vision sat back , would lean forward seemed altogether uncomfortable he would mess canopy time , since n't lock place properly side , 'd pull out i gave stroller one star even steep discount price i paid , n't dependable ease use non-existant -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- update : i went back drawing board narrowed top two replacement choices thezooper twist stroller , coconut waves ( almost price joovy comes foot muff , mosquito net rain cover ) maclaren ( i wishy washey whether go low-end high-end ) i happened stop discount store found amaclaren volo stroller , pea green black stripefor less than half price joovy ( less listed ) i could n't resist trying out so far i love love love it it feels much sturdy , handles higher comfortable grip it weighs 8 pounds i thought joovy light ( compared gracco quattro ) thing divine i fold one hand ( using pull strap ) carry shoulder strap ! best , son n't seem mind sitting , even sits back ! 
-1	my partner i received shower first child it 's nice look looks like $ 300+ stroller that said , probably would 've returned actually purchased first , yellow color really cute , attracts bees ! so , 're going buy stroller , pick different color secondly , wheels pretty cheap stroller price range third , 's somewhat cumbersome adjust recline positions seat fourth , 're taller 5'6 '' tall , 'll sore back bending reach handles one this n't problem us ( 're 5'6 '' shorter ) , i definitely see uncomfortable families 's dad dads taller 5'6 '' ! fifth , barely fit trunk bmw we 've since purchased family-of-four friendly vehicle but , i still think lot people issues not-so-portable stroller heaving various vehicles sixth , cargo area pretty small but , zippered pockets back super handy ! and finally ( seventh ) , drink holders angled fit slender bottle water starbucks cups ! 
-1	i generally like tiny love products purchased mobile past i needed second mobile newborn twins thought would try different model variety big mistake not motor noisy ( constant loud whirring noise ) mobile way too noisy cute little figures skit across `` pond '' make loud clacking sound hear clear across house finally , quality music terrible compared ( older model ) tiny love mobile exact music/song selection , sounds like crap ! like bad recording yes used new batteries ( fact tried replacing batteries twice , better ) sent mobile back amazon refund dissatisfied i even called tiny love give feedback bottom line : do n't bother try different mobile 
-1	i picked necklace based color i n't realize smelled like vanilla i returned i ended getting another one black 
-1	i purchased necklace based positive reviews , washable , thin cord as soon arrived i gave baby play get used her thumb got stuck small ( small ! ) pendant hole i able snap necklace since n't worked i never use intended ; way keep occupied nursing instead looking around every noise i read reviews babies liked cord similar necklaces smaller beads i knew baby would once started sucking cord i realized could easily become choking hazard sucked much mouth , i n't thought time purchase hindsight seems obvious ! i believe i 'm going try return despite liking chew 
-1	pictures make product seem made different material - rubbery , flexible bends pressure it actually good texture baby teeth , i 'm not complaining , stating picture makes look like made harder substance it , casual looking i like rope part necklace , i originally chosen `` chewbead necklaces '' i read reviews said hair could get caught , simple string would n't the problem clasp cheap cheap n't begin describe it n't take strength 5 month old pull clasp release , never actually stays connected around neck the part necklace appealing would n't toy constantly falling ground well not really , clasp n't strong enough match 5 month old if i paid maximum $ 5-8 product , i 'd apt give 4 stars , i not believe cheaply made product costs $ 18+ ! ! ! ! i recommend anyone likes idea concept simply buy rope necklace strong clasp connect baby 's already favorite teether 
-1	my daughter absolutely loved bottles air seal bottom gets incredibly smelly quickly unless sterilize every time , shrinks leak ! 
-1	i purchased bottles month birth baby i convinced i would love , could n't wait start using to surprise , i hate want throw trash i hate throw $ 25 trash so , i using last resort bottles dirty damaged cons:1 they leak like crazy they leak bottom top this huge disadvantage breastfeeding moms 2 there many parts ( 6 ) wash keep these parts also take lot space drying them 3 you ca n't pump directly them 4 it difficult warm milk thick plastic rubber insert bottom it takes 3-4x time takes milk heat bottles 5 when attempting heat bottles , i noticed water would turn cloudy the milk would leak bottle , i pretty sure water soaked bottle this occurred even bottle properly assembled 6 the holes bottom bottle perfect place bacteria , mold spores , etc enter bottle placed different surfaces ( counters , refrigerator shelves , tables , etc ) i uncomfortable leaving bottle fridge day , renders bottle useless me 7 hassle ! ! ! ! pros:1 they look nice 2 the cap used medicine cup 3 my baby less gas i could get bottles work 
-1	i non-anti-colic version daughter she likes lot so bought anti-colic version unfortunately two major flaws i go back original ones cons:1 anti-colic feature not working well : i still see bubbles coming nipple daughter sucking milk the air supposed get bottom bottle , feeding smooth baby n't pause let air bottle 2 leaking bottom using bottle warmer : this problem brought many reviewers i saw one reviewer saying loosing top part heating solve problem it makes perfect sense when bottle heat , air find way if top part air-tight , air put milk bottom get but still leaks even i loose top part pros:1 easy clean : i give credit design bottle compared dr brown 's , i n't use bottle brushes tube brushes that pain clean dr brown bottles for bottle , i remove bottom , i clean bottle body without brush bare hands the nipple big i stick finger clean the bottom part also big smooth easy clean the bottom line not work if want try , i would suggest warm milk different container pour bottle 
-1	my daughter seemed like mam pacifier i bought product there many parts clean much margin error using easy screw together skewed , resulting leakage also , heating milk putting bottle cup hot water not work milk escapes bottom holes also , daughter attempts eat , though rated slow flow , nipple drips fast not keep , resulting choking milk getting everywhere i really wish i purchased one bottles instead pack three ! 
-1	this product would genius actually worked properly ! ! i installed thing perfectly , following directions letter my issue whenever i depress pedal open lid insert diaper , next time pedal not work i actually open whole darn re-shut re-engage pedal , several times , get work you ca n't pry open lid b/c clamping mechanism not work if unit worked perfectly would best diaper invention ever i think diaper genie inventive one without working properly time its real hassle use listed issues product its beyond frustrating buy risk your 's might work might not 
-1	this thing piece junk ! my husband i tossed soon refills used those smart people playtex designed diaper take liners liners lot money considering plastic bags ! ! we tried using plastic bags not work open bag sinks bottom plus liners n't even smell good soon step stand open pail , smell poop , do not buy ! instead buy little wastebasket lid , change bag diapers bi-weekly stink , lot less mula ! 
-1	we daughter born , i must say looks cool , half time i lazy tired even walk diaper genie throw diaper , half time throwing diapers plastic bags instead being first time parent tires like other as got older , started actually using diaper genie noticed sometimes would leakage poop smell diaper genie i thought supposed contain smell ! needless say , reverted plastic bags gave diaper genie away friend in opinion , not necessary one 
-1	dont waste money new mommies it absolutely one things think need complete nursery its hassle worth refills expensive save dollars ! 
-1	i researched extensively i bought , i surprised ended bad product does n't hold 270 diapers ; lid n't open easily comes hinges ; push diaper make room someone said glorified garbage pail , reality normal garbage pail would n't cause problems 
-1	this product either defective not effective we n't use often smell seeps makes nursery smell foul like i said , mine could defective diapers n't go way unit unless push lid sits kinda funny unfortunately ca n't return items past certain time frame amazon i would n't buy baby born ( like i ) i would probably pass one sooo many things buy getting ready baby 
-1	i got rid diaper genie ii bought diaper dekor instead 've happy diaper dekor recommend that - holds diapers -- must changed every days ( diaper dekor holds 5x many diapers needs changed weekly , every 8-9 days ) - refill not last long gets expensive ( diaper dekor refill lasts forever -- like 2 months , i think ! way cheaper ) - i hated : i scratched hands every time i stuck diaper plastic ring around refill sticks i honestly bled almost every time it awful ( diaper dekor step pedal , hands never go inside ) - n't really problem smell control either , 6mo old exclusively breastfed course , smells like roses : - ) 
-1	thing gigantic ! unless huge house big nursery , thing not fit also totally unnecessary - little bags sell fine : put diapers individual bag , tie closed put trash big fuss - big pail - needed 
-1	i thought elite would better current straight diaper genie used year half first born sir-ie ! the seal n't stinks room one diaper inside the regular diaper genie great i wish i woulda stuck i knew instead thinking & # 34 ; upgrading & # 34 ; elite i 
-1	we used use regular trashcan airtight lid hold dirty diapers , 's many times wash put baking soda bottom need new container so , visiting friend i noticed actual diaper pail , not trashcan , worked really well it diaper champ worked great you could n't smell anything standing right next for reason though , i decided try diaper genie i liked could open foot -- bit hard twist back forth one hand ( course also two years old ) big mistake i bought diaper champ , kept box return diaper genie the smell horrible after diapers , 's smelly plus , every time opens releases lot smell i checked internal closure mechanism still shut i open -- , 's not broken one , sucks also 's really flimsy plastic feels like 's going break whenever i open take bag and bags horrible ! they made bags half size actual space inside change constantly ( bags big actual plastic ring come , tiny ! ) the pail could literally hold another bag worth diapers space available around current bag and opens middle remove bag ca n't use without bag i 'm going try bags , seems like would quite difficult put but i 'll probably end giving away buying diaper champ do n't buy product ! 
-1	but size pail huge , height toliet water tank ! the main complaint deso n't seal smell throw another one the smell comes soon put foot peddle then , bathroom smells terrible if n't open , smell i n't like now i bag diaper # 2 outside house everyday the pail n't serve original purpose ! this pail trash lid one wasting money buying pail bags expensive 
-1	our diaper genie broke within month ! the month , pain behind mess around tying plastic ends i switched regular garbage n't problem smell 
-1	my daughter little 6 months old , eating solids - odor not huge issue both husband i found diaper genie good idea , poorly executed first foremost - genius playtex create something used expensive refills basically $ 35 waste plastic neither us thought diaper genie worth it the idea giant plastic bag `` tube '' tie when full bag , use cutter tie end toss ideally , contains odors better provides hands free ( little step handle ) option toss diapers however , 9 10 times need lift lid whole cutting/tying process takes longer retrieving new bag construction seems kind flimsy , factor cost product plus cost refills diaper genie elite becomes one expensive diaper pail 2+ years child mostly likely diapers ! imo - skip , buy roll 4 gallon trash bags ( buy scented ones $ 4 100 ) small waste basket effectively thing fraction price 
-1	when i first got , i saw flaw design as daughter got older i able see flaws you want get something seals diaper individually , way keep stench bombarding home with soon open , whether throw away diaper change bag , 're going regret owning 
-1	i 'm 3rd baby 2 different models item both lids broken , light use it also pathetically little keep smell my current model pretty much paperweight corner nursery using grocery bags dispose diapers i got munchkin arm hammer diaper pail evaluate release next month i tossed old diaper genie right trash ; ) i figure ca n't worse , lol ! 
-1	i idea got positive reviews it 's long long piece elastic cloth ( like 8 ft 2 1/2 ft ) , i could easily stitched it 's not something put baby right away go each wrap session takes like 5 minutes becomes loose undone , unwrap rewrap hands ( baby might fall 're ) 
-1	too hot baby ! i keep house 69 degrees might half baby stripped diaper still sweats other i love , ca n't use 
-1	my baby 2 months old ( weighs 14 pounds ) infant insert already difficult use as petite woman , difficult lift baby entirely head i slide inside infant insert i , infant insert keeps folding legs keep getting caught , requires i many times baby even threw it may easy put infants weigh less 7 pounds small i difficulty putting baby even newborn 8 pounds 
-1	this n't bad product , i bought i realized ergo carrier made updated infant insert seems much better one i would recommend this n't seem helpful my daugher n't like ( probably not reflection product ) ended waiting till closer six months old n't use insert save money wait till baby older , buy new heart heart insert 
-1	the bowl works good catch dropped food n't stick tray well my daughter pull right little effort if looking i would pass 
-1	i us baby food mill consistency grinds cooked food chunky tiny hole spoon it tiny hole if plan feeding finely pureed mush baby several months end , might work might really tho , hole small getting even mush smoothly enough flows spoon instead shooting high velocity in words it 's yuppy toy n't quite hit mark comes taking good concept fleshing usable product 
-1	the snail not float staying want float side my daughter enjoys rings like rattles pretty much 
-1	i glass bottles , need top evenflow please sell tops alone without having to buy whole set ! 
-1	i 've little store bogota ( colombia ) cost last november $ 2 99 pack three yesterday , prime recommended $ 12 why change ? i 've offered nursing bottle customers $ 2 99 one star seller 
-1	but leak every avent bottle used leaked not hard , yellow ones , clear ones come blue ring well the funny part , first buy -- n't leak however , seems bottle nipple used , likely leak , since babies eat anywhere 6-10 times day start leaking pretty quickly hated every avent bottle i tried everyone i know problem however , want keep replacing nipple every weeks , 's and trick , supposedly , `` fix '' leaking what put nipple ring , line vents nipple blocked white things screw bottle this worked maybe one feeding never worked do n't buy 
-1	these bottles extremely frustrating sometimes leak , times n't and trying suggestions prevent stop leaking avail , i 'm giving do not buy ! i used born-free bottles working nanny never deal leak i reccomend instead 
-1	i 've read bottles made england i thought quality superior wrong i it started leak 2 months use i liked bottle cuz pretty small comfortable child grip , leaking takes good away be wise , n't buy ! 
-1	i writing review sheer frustration ! i want warn moms dads ridiculous bottles ! please not buy them- drive insane ! a friend mine nurse recommended avent bottles use i figured knew talking working babies day also- i read reviews different sites place ! there many good reviews poor ones so i figured i would give try now give credit help sons gas problem , durable wash easy , avent makes lots nice products babies but i soooo wish i n't waste money bottles ! they way overpriced leak ! it frustrating since sometimes leak- times fine ( leaking didnt begin right away- yes- i buy new nipples every weeks ) and sometimes leak plastic ring times nipples drip like faucet ( i use newborn size ! ) it upsetting spend sorts time pumping milk instant tip bottle pours ! i one time lost entire ounce breastmilk one tip- leaked baby 2 seconds ! or spend money formula goes drain ! crazy ! ! ! it also frustrating screaming baby readjust bottle 5 times wont leak i also read oxygen gets milk takes vitamins milk since vents near nipple every time baby sucks drags air milk making less nutritious bottom line- try must warned bottles leak leak leak do favor playtex ventaire advanced- bottles rock ! 
-1	we used nothing avent bottles first child ( 3 years ago ) loved we never problems leaking i researched bottles quite bit i became pregnant second child although lot people complained leaking i decided try new bpa free bottles i bought 2 pack 4 oz bottles regret the bottles leak horribly like everyone says i tried play i screw lids , tight ( not ) formula pours side bottle what waste money i shocked avent would actually sell poor , quality product what thinking ? 
-1	originally i loved idea able see glance whether room correct temperature , overall look pleasing but issues : - like reviewers mentioned , i not think accurate we also baby monitor shows temperature parent handsets , rarely i think baby monitor shows true temperature matches aircon unit display - i one shelf surface suitable thermometer , placed 1 ft lamp if lamp , affects thermometer not useful - because basic design , not program temperature boundaries , would nice feature personally i like nursery around 69/70 degrees according thermometer , hot - the thermometer n't seem register numbers like 68 degrees , example so flips 67 69 , happens color change point so egg mini disco light display , fighting internal battle show 68 to honest i 'm not sure bothers baby ( 3m ) i find very irritating i night feeds so shame really i n't returned baby monitor i n't show temperature nursery unit , handsets so better nothing for 
-1	after not used pacifier left thrown floor play gym , i decided take cloth clean , well good 's not good quality plush toy alot fuzzy balls looks old this not worth $ 20 matter seller says justify price $ 10 shipping handling not worth , go buy regular soothie plush toy animal less 
-1	i thought set would perfect 1 5 year old unlike reviewers , i n't find size small -- i think little bites easier child my issue materials -- son started chewing handle spoon , within seconds bitten chunk plastic ! turns spoon covered plastic material instead one solid piece if 're using feed baby , fine , active toddlers put things mouths , real hazard please watch child carefully using utensils 
-1	i bought i thought bendable feature good idea but i , i think good feature the mouth spoon fork much small anything rest the fork , particular , rounded i n't think could stab anything , not even bean this bad buy , first time i disappointed boon product ! 
-1	really want like since desperately need good bottle warmer , one unfortunately not good the switch back ! ! terrible design u ask me power turned back u forget turn switch problem not tell since power turn , u easily forget turn switch quite times switch left water boiled dry lucky nothing happened could happen ! ! mom , husbband hate product ; 'd rather put bottles bowl hot water very disappointed product , also priced high advanced technology product 
-1	i listened reviews product i read thought , & # 34 ; eh , hard watch make sure n't get hot & # 34 ; well , sleep deprived 's middle night fall back sleep answer hard there signal bottle ready keep checking hate bottle warmer passion 
-1	so used bottle warmer 8 months i say , sleep deprived parents using item , often middle night , would think avent would wise enough put auto-shut-off feature little doohickey but , i exclusively feed baby breastmilk , stuff like `` liquid gold '' ( everyone told , i 'm inclined agree ) , i ca n't even tell often i put bottle warmer warm forgot like 15 minutes the milk gets boiling hot time , 's useless i pour 's not supposed heated boiling i know people probably going read wonder one could forget put bottle warmer , baby sleeping night , 's husband giving bath , i get bottle ready gives bottle bath puts bed ( time week ) so many times i forgotten burned milk , also - really dangerous part - light shut like 30 seconds time ( call `` blinking '' , believe ) , often look like 's turned bottle , n't , keep heating water 's gone we found couple hours away n't notice `` blinking '' light time , indication 's front the switch back 's not clearly marked `` on/off '' either i ca n't imagine n't caught fire people melted plastic water gone thankfully , i noticed water completely gone , almost gone how unsafe ! anyway , i still use i n't found one auto-off feature , looking one i set timer microwave whenever i put bottle half brain cells disappeared baby born apparently , i 'm way distracted remember 's bad design ! ! ! 
-1	had high hopes bottle warmer following set backs trying out:1 milk not heated evenly , even cycle ends 2 the light turns done heating , easy mistake unit off 3 no auto shut option 4 milk not heat times advertised product 
-1	n't warm quickly , not easy fill right level , auto-off system , i n't know different levels warm ( book actually never mention use maximum one ) not safe stated , baby can get burned really get milk super warm ( even lower level ) careful plus side well , n't take much space 's still easier pan water 's 
-1	i found pain butt use the water level right too low : n't heat enough too high : scalding hot bottle i n't think bottle warmers work well i found putting boiling water stove microwave much easier i able check temp with breast milk -- need warmer if using formula -- make go skip warmer 
-1	the whole point bottle warmer make life convenient because let 's face , container hot water job well tired moms dads willing pay convenience anything make life easier caring baby unfortunately , bottle warmer warm bottles , features make totally inconvenient use 1 turn unit , heating element constantly cycling maintain desired temp light front tells actual heating element , not unit so light could , unit could still because , it 's easy accidentally leave unit , eventually water evaporates do enough times , unit overheat break 2 on/off switch back unit , totally inconvenient the inconvenience compounded fact switch `` east/west '' orientation , not north/south like light switch as , 's not intuitive way so n't commit memory `` left side , right side '' , since light front n't reliable way know unit , turn unit around time make sure 's off 3 if get distracted ( easy 're caring infant ) leave bottle long , get scalding hot bottom line : do n't waste money 
-1	nice product quality but formula use ( enfamil nutramigen ) cant heat so dont use hut either way baby boy didnt care warm room temp 
-1	this review probably pull lot vitriol woodwork , must done if n't reading , following news reading research current plastic bpa fiasco , child concerned , educating yourself you may read `bpa plastics ' safe alternative plastics used baby bottles , truth always something simpler advertising whether folks want admit not another matter bpa plastic still leaches carcinogens get absorbed cells consider alone this stuff number one culprit rise numbers breast cancer polymers love concentrate near fat cells while leach smaller amounts , still leach both ama 's findings american plastics council 's recommendations , equally suggest not subjecting plastic extreme temperature changes , like intense cold intense heat cause molecular breakdown within plastic thus causing leak i n't really know much direct , even though still like say 's safe the part 're not elaborating : safe inert , marketed state once start using product however , 're bound go recommendations do freeze baby milk plastic bottles plastic containers ? you n't plastic leaching milk you 're using plastic recommendations do microwave milk plastic containers ? you n't plastic leaches milk highest rate conditions you 're using plastic recommendations have ever put finger bowl microwave one minute , bowl hotter food ? what think happening plastic scenario ? do even put plastic bottle onto warmer warm bottom ? you 're using plastic standard recommendations what ? use glass it 's simple if use product suggested bpa free plastic avent bottles microwave sterilize , heating far beyond limitations specified thus putting infant possible danger as parent , 's not chance i 'm willing take while company spokespeople come tell 's safe , enough information readily available elucidates opposite a lot people switched plastic glass large numbers obvious nature problem if 're older 30 years old , 're probably person brought glass infant feeding bottles while plastic feeding bottles available late seventies , n't become common early mid-eighties i wo n't go numbers certain widely-reported problems infantile neurologic problems , correlations made spike statistics widespread use plastic i 'm not denigrating product , let 's clear point i 'm suggested use coupled plastic bottles foolhardy day age , especially since glass bottles , safe , n't hard come i sterilized glass bottles ( not nipples caps ) never problems 2 years practice the product convenient easy use i strongly advise using any type plastic bottle loaded chamber if product wish use , use small 4 oz gerber bottles , inexpensive , safe readily available when child needs larger 8 oz bottle five months beyond , sterilizer may prove small avent iq24 might better choice , glass bottle not suggested `bpa free ' plastic bottles plastic bottle available it 's hard completely safe days , parents glass bottles , large majority us glass bottles therefore extend courtesy children common feeding apparatus first two years it may convenient buy use plastic , glass bottles sturdy , not break crack quick come if 're thinking `` would give child glass bottle ' , 're not thinking properly if child throws bottle lot , buy strap bottle also readily available easily obtained my son n't issue complaints yet , guess neither mothers microwaving bpa plastic plastic bad idea lot reasons 
-1	this bottle warmer not worth 's price based test runs i put warmer i 'd say 's ok 're looking heat bottle room temperature the digital features nothing special you repeatedly press button get warmer set proper setting want heat once , 's anyones guess whether not bottle warmer actually warm contents bottle not in heating refrigerated bottles i found contents stay cold bottle heats i 'd much prefer warmer heat contents bottle rather container if heating room temperature bottle i found warmer work adequately the warmer intended used avent bottles in following instructions warmer , warmer successfully resulted cracking room temperature dome cap bottle time warming i called avent customer service replaced dome cap the warmer needs specified amount water poured bottom order function properly ( per user instructions ) i found irritating n't include small measuring cup purpose most glass measuring cups baking not 1oz mark , warming required amount water i use baby bottle measure correct amount it 's minor issue , irritated warmer sells $ 50 n't it i would suggest looking elsewhere bottle warmer 's must list nearly ten years ago i warmer the first years ( i believe called quick serve ) uses concept warmer actually performed supposed i would suggest checking offer 
-1	new : i reason love hate product i n't pay you clearly see says vine review i want love , honestly - i 'm beyond grateful i n't pay i 'd going hassle returning there nothing iq unless 70 i tried others suggested , adding water setting larger amount significantly defeats purpose `` iq '' warmer hey , i wanted give fair shot i tried different bottles ( avent specifically ) still wrong the top still fire , milk cold newest thing ? on fourth try flashes lights longer allows select anything broken four uses ? really ? there plenty baby products actually make life easier warmer not one them -- -- -- old review : i want love i really it seems simple straight forward put little bit water , pick temp , pick amount , start however , 's definitely learning curve i n't quite figured yet i read reviews i still ca n't seem get bottle `` right '' biggest issue seems lid top bottle hot part bottle feels cold once i get figured , really make late night bottles significantly easier , actually headache i 'll update i get figured ( btw : i 'm using dr browns bottles - natural flow 4oz maybe someone advice i 'm wrong get right ? ) 
-1	i thought i would receiving iq24 , i received large size plastic container type thing goes microwave it pretty much like big tupperware container put bottles put microwave sterilize the directions say wash bottles soapy water using contraption really i 'm not sure i 'd need i n't dish washer i guess makes sure bottles sterlized properly , use really hot water give good wash would n't really need go extra step but n't time really need bottles extra safe/clean , i suppose giving quick wash popping container microwave could helpful 
-1	i got thinking son would love easy time holding since loop top my son n't like maybe played couple times since i 've i n't know clean get rubbery smell i tried wiping running water ( covering hole squeaks ) still smells pretty rubbery i say try friends first investing toy your baby either love not care 
-1	i bought teether 5-month-old daughter now half year below observations past month : pros : * it makes squeaky sound , draws attention whenever i want * it soft wo n't hurt daughter cons : * it extremely strong odor i 'm not sure whether natural rubber supposed smell way maybe would please someone , not i doubt baby * the shape teether chewing-proof it 's round smooth everywhere , except two tiny foot parts i ca n't imagine baby bite unless s/he extremely big mouth * it looks cute grow-ups , probably not babies the color light color contract low my daughter would never pay attention , placed together colorful teethers * it tastes strange i tested tongue very unpleasant flavor i would never want daughter chew it we keep two reasons : 1 ) squeaky sounds help grab daughter 's attention ; 2 ) looks cute decorative toy 
-1	purchased two case one got lost one squeaker defective the paint job poorly executed -- especially around ears rubber `` threads '' trailed top one very cute face , though also softer head body sophie ears nice size smaller mouths nibble easier squeeze sophie too bad n't made well sophie we 're sticking sophie 
-1	got product excitedly ordering started using color shade started peeling son use chew it unacceptable n somehow cudnt return product neways wiidnt suggest anybody buy product claims organic not deal basic problems 
-1	my baby ( turned one year old ) dislike toy immediately present the squeaky sound way loud annoying she actually scared refuse handle i would n't mind spending money good product unfortunately product not expected ( mainly due squeaky noise think rubber fine ) 
-1	lo didnt care annoying sound not realy teether opinion want squeeky toy , 
-1	my 2 y/o had an accident and this thing leaked right through the car seat , and onto the actual car seat ! it was a mess ! ! ! and in the winter was a horrible ride home because she was soaked and freezing waste of money ! better off with a plastic bag ! 
-1	i bought thing long car trip piece mind potty-trained toddler took nap car i n't want prematurely put pullups confuse on way vacation , accidents on way back took nap pulled gas station i pulled seat find accident i happy used piddle pad ( still fully place ) but , i pulled replace , i realized entire seat underneath absolutely soaked in fact , soaked shape piddle pad so , last two hours trip 've make sopping napkins well could given limited resources available gas station this thing pure waste money time as side nte , i ben unimpressed summer infant products around i problems brand new items past includinga monitor thermometer these tree items items purchased relied i done summer infant products think twice purchasing item 
-1	thankfully 2yr daughter n't many accidents , one time happened kiddopotamus , piddlepad not job retain water keep car seat dry i suppose could worse , like n't use piddlepad given wet car seat got needless say i remove car seat cover clean i n't know similar type products i not recommend 
-1	i thought another brand i usually buy i like size fuzzibunz diapers work fine , scratchy rough 
-1	i never caught entire bm one narrow they exactly width diapers , thin clingy bunch stick baby 's body moves they softer imse vimse liners , 's point poop gets place ? i 'm going back imse vimse wider , less flimsy 
-1	these liners great size , microfleece washable liners i cut much better job keep baby dry 
-1	i bought along first order cloth diapers 4 months ago ( i use flip diaper covers flip organic cotton prefolds mostly also econobum bumgenius 4 0 's flip stay dry inserts ) ) being new cloth diapering ( mom 18 month 22 month old diapered potty trained three year old ) course i nervous # 2 messes i tried liners inexpensive safe septic systems they look like dryer sheets filmy coating soft touch they fit great diapers , especially older baby using one size diapers fully expanded i surprised big enough she 's pretty regular i thought i could put insert would usually need one course lot wasted liners wet often bummis inserts got bunched diaper led either chaffing poor bottom lack coverage went # 2 mess ended diaper cover anyway ! they worked okay us maybe smaller baby one frequent movements might better you i also really n't like throw away liner every time wet i switched cloth wanted keep things simple washing cloth wipes diapers not disposable items diaper pail washables i tried fleece reusable liners bumgenius almost worse- things stuck even so i kept fleece liners case i use diaper rash cream something i 'll probably give away bummis liners i use regular spray bottle grocery store narrowest stream setting spray dirty diapers takes bit hand exercise spray really bad one works great removes mess little staining i not buy expensive sprayer i n't sure i would like cloth diapers i used spray bottle temporarily i 'm going keep works great , liners mess , travel i n't hook sprayer anyone 's plumbing clean diapers water spray doubles wipes spray dry cloth wipes i keep old pampers wipe tub good luck whatever decide use !

-1	these cute , much snug daughter 's not pudgy neck the velcro closure quite scratchy managed scratch girl 's neck the characters cute the material could thicker bib bigger it got soaked minutes ! 
-1	i already bought carters blanket babiesrus , i needed another one , i bought amazon do n't know , difference two supposely identical blanket day night the one amazon thin , much lighter weight blanket hair falls easily i 've always suspected amazon sold fake , i doubt it it 's possibility two blankets different batches , carters factory n't make specification , even though supposed follow exact spec 
-1	pros : perfect size size diapers wipeshas little side pocket smaller itemshardware seems pretty sturdycons : fabric quality seems pooroverall structure seems poorly designed- shape sort irregular overpriced 
-1	my husband went pick gerber waterproof multi-use pads changing table since keeps throwing away get poop i wish would stop since clean great wash anyway , picked instead thinking better since little wrong they small first , pretty much size baby since anything comes baby contain one small area ? we dried low plastic still little melted we use kitchen drying pots & pans & work great ! we use gerber pads changing table , great , dry high & piles anything after 5 months little fraying edges , i live that btw i gave 2 stars i use drying dishes & like 
-1	these curled around edges i 'd look around there better ones also pretty rough feeling 
-1	the baby n't due little i washed preparation after reading reviews i careful washing air dried wo n't wanting wash cold water covered poo though i disappointed rough feel washed i also iron band around outside must shrunk less rest material the ironing sort worked although still roll little around edges i time world compared baby arrives , i hope problem resolves wo n't ironing baby ! my current advice n't bother i 'll let know dec baby arrives suddenly turn utterly wonderful *****update*******the baby year old i used 5 rotation last year only one ready rubbish , rest gone storage another baby i realised initial assessment harsh these saved remove wash changing pad cover every time baby # 2 escaped i changed - quite regularly for price , i think , retrospect , quite good buy sorry boppy 
-1	i agree previous reviewers anything designed catch baby poop pee able go washer and dryer regular settings i 'm not going run delicate cycle air dry changing pad liners ? these total waste money i ended purchasing dynarex disposable underpad , 17 inches x 24 inches , 100 count love they perfect fit changing table laundry required i n't change every diaper , i need - going last long time 
-1	these awful once wash curl tight scroll not lay flat terrible purchase after unsuccessfully trying get lay flat i threw away what waste 
-1	did n't work i super smooth glazed tile shower , thought suction would ideal wrong just think dangerous thing n't work ! ouch ! 
-1	this product simply bulky ugly us keep home although really loved concept daughter loves use kickboard crib , need additional purchase returned 
-1	nicely made holds pacifiers well , coat antimicrobial , teflon finish , contains countless toxic chemicals not best something containing item designed specifically baby 's mouth ! i researched ju ju be coats fabrics , chemicals used not safe teflon agion finishes not & # 34 ; non-toxic & # 34 ; not used items babies going contact way pacifiers stored put baby 's mouth not good idea i learned i already purchased number ju ju be products expensive mistake ! i wish i 'd known coated purchase i would never bought ju ju be 's products nicely made practical thought , i wish would make without chemical finish ! 
-1	i guess say & # 34 ; colors may vary & # 34 ; n't consider boy/girl factor i boy , would happy color pink , 's i got sending back , probably not going order another 
-1	bought vacation these glasses would not stay toddler 's head i going try rig string keep face , lense fell bag useless 
-1	these developed holes shredded couple months they thin my osocozy unbleached flats bit thicker held wonderfully 
-1	if looking cloth diapers , educate somewhere like green mountain diapers website the prefolds sell work well , absorb disposables these prefolds , hand , hardly absorb anything , comes baby pee they really good job , though , spit 
-1	not good comparison indian prefold diapers places like green mountain , little lions , etc these barely hold ounces liquid without leaking i bought two packs lost reciept , i guess i 'll use rags , extra wipes i run low i wo n't using diapers , though 
-1	living two story home , decided wanted monitor two receivers : one upstairs , one downstairs went back also hard hear speakers not great 
-1	we purchased based good reviews returned next day maybe different baby monitors work differently different peoples homes , got incredible amount static little sound quality we spent hours adjusting channels , sensitivity volume decided life short spend much time baby monitor sent back we purchased angel care monitor love ( day three ) if holds past 1 year , new favorite monitor 
-1	i n't understand not people complaining , volume monitor really low ! i 've seen reviews saying thing , seems people n't bothered ! ? maybe something wrong placed baby unit differently done something differently parent unit - i tried kind different constellations locations n't seem make difference we without monitor got one time listen baby living room night that worked ok , i preferred using monitor make sure 'd hear even tv dishwasher but turned one make no difference ! the noise heard , listen across hallway pretty much loud came baby monitor ! i 'm sure reception features great seems like good quality monitor - seems pretty pointless still ca n't hear baby ! i returned graco monitor n't many good reviews - i hear baby !

-1	this baby monitor worked great roughly year it always well taken care however , 13 months suddently stopped working given price paid i expected last 13 months i would not recommend buying when deciding baby monitor i really wish i listened reviews mentioned monitor n't last

-1	this product contains bpa given product teether toy , i not know fisher price thinking would continue manufacture item using bpa plastic i like design , i would never buy teether product baby containing bpa

-1	we bought son turned 2 finally sleeping room he loved stars colors plush turtle unfortunately , little less year use , stopped working we replaced batteries simply would n't turn anymore we even tried different brand batteries success it fun lasted , longevity product really would nice 
-1	as soon i took sea turtle box late 2010 , i noticed paint one animals shell scratched but i high expectations product & really wanted like much i thought i would , i kept it there good aspects night light it work extremely well night light grow daughter , using since little six months old she enjoys colors , stars , different animals lighting , playing turtle & buttons i enjoy using teaching tool endangered animals grows along story & adoption certificate i like three projecting color choices & placed easily around room the turtle soft , plush , & wipes clean well vinegar & baking soda however -- story not great , battery drain & cover n't easy get put back , paint continued chip making worry ingredients & safety child my biggest problem stars the constellations single colors n't accurate , third color creates pretty blue-green turtle shell , actually casts two projection colors onto wall together -- result incredibly disconcerting & messy-looking double projection containing two moons & two sets stars right next & overlapping recently started intermittently failing , well expected 3,000 hours use cloud b says last as amateur astronomer one parents since i n't much older almost 2-year-old , 2 stars quality concerns high price gets 2 stars me i 'd also like know `` portion proceeds '' actually means ( 5 % ? 25 % ? ) `` international conservation organization '' going so much charity donations corporations marketing gimmicks get consumers buy item ; vague information given buyer makes likely scenario i not like much i thought i would i listened reviews well friends & purchased regular turtle instead 
-1	i really wanted work , wouldnt stay long , coming crashing , usually middle night where live , not allowed drill holes use adhesive option 
-1	i rarely give product bad review i tend read high low reviews purchase usually assume user error negative reviews this one really n't stick folks claimed i tried several times several locations new clean ceramic tile n't stay let clear , stick minutes frog attached , not weight it slowly pulls away wall falls within 5-10 mins installed i tried reducing weight it n't work this unfortunate i love frog pod i not sticking double sided tape onto brand new tiles 
-1	have older bathroom tile hoped would stick , several attempts ( and reading instructions times ) n't hold weight let alone weight frog 
-1	would not buy the color spot picture good , material scratchy tough anything soft i like luvable friends sheets better they soft n't shrink 
-1	washed sheets stored closet use , found two holes using sheet first time 
-1	this sheet nice soft started pill 3 washes additionally attracts lint terribly point i use lint brush son wo n't lint stuck get mouth i would n't buy rarely use 
-1	this crib sheet felt rough right package , i thought might soften washing nope it 's bordering itchy , nowhere near & # 34 ; sateen & # 34 ; i would n't buy product , i would not recommend 
-1	there two major reasons avoid product first , installation mess it 's nearly impossible align latch hook properly too high , door wo n't close engage latch too low , latch n't work , allowing child easily open it second , hard yank allow open even installed properly for reason another , fast yank seems cause latch fail , easy access the pleasant part short screws , 're easy remove throw away if reasons n't enough steer away latch system , i 'm not sure horrible installation process , poor safety , poor functionality if n't ready tear couple days , must gotten miraculous batch 
-1	as reviewers said , design product bad even if able install sweet spot ( around 1/8 inch ) solid pull open drawer anyway the installation also overly tedious hardware low quality , go elsewhere 
-1	i wanted like despite reviews short ties we babyletto mercer 3-in-1 convertible crib the corners wide ties super short ! i love soft minky dot fabric form n't seem like would hold i could n't even get tied try seems like would take whole thing change sheet no thank

-1	i n't like poor quality i never use , first wash i thought better quality , carters always good products 
-1	cons : too small swaddling too small thin wrapping baby feeling cozy pros : cute patterns comes dryer feeling soft 
-1	really think called blanket you need use multiple keep baby warm !

-1	i shocked excellent reviews sheet received i purchased sheet major department store sale i tried daughters mattress sheets roomy well june 6,2011 i print another cute dotted pink brown sheet also carters it yesterday july 9th i went put sheets mattress i saw corner slit ! i washed sheets delicate cycle mattress new nothing could punctured i looked dotted sheets see tiny holes forming rip corners i surprised since sheets name brand performed poor manner i guess gave product 5 stars got lucky better quality material i promptly returned sheets refund i actually crib sheet 16 years old first daughter still excellent condition such pretty sheet experience not worth money 
-1	i not believe great reviews i never even got use sheets shrank 50 % original size i washed/dryed first time ( dryer n't even get hot ) i stupid first time mom registered 4 sets washed together had purchase another sheet set ( 2 ) 've used 2 1/2 years this top stupid baby purchases

-1	i give two star due fact hold car seat one ripped half first flight way home one lost zipper the material extremely inflexible cold weather i actually cracked thirteen degree zero day ! it cold doubt brand new find another option 
-1	i 'll admit , kiddo big he 's 21 months almost 35 pounds tall he 's little intimidated booster seat n't seem like sit `` '' everyone , i bought unfortunately huge waste time , effort , money the harness tight `` slump '' and , i 'm not idiot - i realize adjustable adjusted largest setting incidentally , fits fine old cheap plastic high chair harness i would not recommend anybody larger child 
-1	i bought chair i thought cool i admit we also liked idea daughter able sit table & # 34 ; us & # 34 ; fact chair would good 6 years old here 's thing : dont want kid at table year old , not sense sharing surface next table- great , at table big mess they really need attached tray space make inevitable mess between highchair baby kit , 're almost $ 300 really n't suitable highchair 13 month old might good chair neat eating 2 3 year old , using younger child , 's really really impractical we got plenty compliments design unfortunately , people appreciated look n't watch elaborate cleanup thumbs 
-1	we given tripp trapp chair gift , sadly i bought tihs baby set without reading reviews amazon first this chair literally torture little one , literally thrown away purchased different set fraction price not inflict severe harm baby as mentioned reviews , baby inserted chair forcing legs weird angle his/her legs contorted best tears tears clearly never designed baby chair , throw `` baby set '' afterthought absolutely fraudulent cruel tt customers ' babies interestingly , wondering anyone could rate product anything better horrible , i read one `` positive '' review one simply `` pinch '' tab holds baby seat lift , voile , baby come without breaking his/her legs process excuse ? this tab holds baby seat front , plastic hard stiff idea `` pinching '' joke more like , get husband two neighbors help squeeze incredible stiff pieces together kneeling chair , take hammer ( baby still chair ) pound tab pushes extremely tight hole this piece is built to remain installed , idea one satisfied customer literally remove entire baby seat order remove baby ( without baby 's legs broken hyper-extended ) simply confirms reality baby seat defectively designed that customer furthermore satisfied makeshift `` solution '' horrendous problem shows clearly desperate avoid admitting wasted money horrendous product i also feel horrible complete waste money tried husband figure way live mistake , end day real high chair not expensive important us something actually feel comfortable using , not involve breaking nails using hammer hammer baby seat every time i want remove baby ( imagine choking something , clearly every high chair feature quick easy release ) if i tripp trapp i would immediately recall product baby die choking stuckin chair , breaks legs yanked choking fit this literally dangerous product i surprised even market 
-1	the baby set seems needed , stiff hard little one get she keep legs stiff ofer get process , straps connect within seat hard manuever my 6 month old daughter n't like hard confinement chair offers i 'm looking forward growing bit try straps not baby set 
-1	this review brown `` snugglesaurus '' blanket while soft cute , i experienced annoying problem blanket : good 2-3 washes , gradually starts shed onto baby 's clothes ! lint screen wo n't thing , neither fabric softener sheets - sheds , sheds , sheds german shepard ! i toss baby 8 months old hardly blanket left ( thinned a lot ) many clothes stubborn brown lint hard remove i given ( lint roller n't work ) this happened fairly light use : washed twice month used infant carrier if decide get make sure wash separately everything else , beware even washer/dryer shed lint onto baby 's stuff it 's ruined quite baby 's lighter pajamas i ca n't stand little brown lint dots , look worn dirty this one purchase i completely regret ! 
-1	i give 2 stars good idea worked month little hands figured velcro pretty useless it removed inside outside crib matter positioned , little stop teething rails 
-1	first , crib rail covers not fit snugly securely description photos my toddler daughter 3 , yes 3 , protectors crib i overlap use zip ties hold would n't lift chew crib the covers secure velcro tabs easy kids undo my daughter able undo tabs 12 months old the idea tabs hold toys novel idea , never want kid sleep i though i put toys cover daughter would play toys not chew crib , i wrong she would play toys not go sleep i would better wrapping edges crib duct tape 
-1	this thing made us crazy usually nuby products well-made reliable this one leaked everywhere , matter carefully secured lid handles , matter often cleaned , smelled like sour milk even run dishwasher sterilize setting i threw three weeks i got , nuby makes much better sippy cups bottles less expense 
-1	i ordered transition baby bottle zippy cup needless say one not work well ! the handles close together child ca n't grasp drink time would better handles far apart also , little girl not like nubby nipples i guess big n't like going try another brand ! 
-1	i fleece early walker bought summer i knew mesh , not expect thin it thin provides warmth whatsoever , really not different without one i 've months used twice , times toddler felt really cold middle night in summer nights house runs 73-75 i 've got lightweight cotton one 
-1	my wife insisted getting killing 99 9 % germs soap hot water not good enough i 'm not convinced sterilizing bottles actually keeps sterile 1 hour 're removed microwave either , i know ? we got anyway , i almost happy not 's great product says ease but , irritating try stand bottles i crammed bottles , nipples , things stack one day , put top , popped microwave my wife refuses let use dr brown 's contraption , i longer wash bottles if bottles bend , tip if lay sides , i n't think sterilize correctly also , surface area inside product not big , lay bottles sides able wash 5 bottles you lean bottle onto adjacent bottle way around sterilizer keep upright ; delicately place bottle circle last bottle resting first bottle ; parts squeeze there sections shelves nipples , get crammed whatever space find washers , rings , components stack top bottles nipples try without tipping original stonehenge bottles , good luck by way , bottles thoroughly cleaned soap hot water even begin build stonehenge if i knew would hassle , i would purchased dishwasher instead if n't option buy dishwasher , look sterilizer makes easy stack bottles upright 
-1	this product huge takes much space barely fits microwave also tongs not sterilized touch sterilized bottles unsterilized tongs where sense ? i returned right away ! 
-1	i rather disappointed sheets they n't soft touch , bumpy bit rough i hoped washing would improve situation , several washings 're nearly bad i took package in addition , strong astringent ( `` chemical '' ) smell - slowly - washed away if 're looking soft organic crib sheet , i highly recommend instead : [ ] 
-1	my 5 month old still swaddled , oddly enough , seems small ( even size small ) the sides wrapped around belly/arms long , velcro barely even works the left side ( wraps around first ) pretty much tucks way underneath back , right side ( wraps around second ) wraps way around back , leaving maybe inch velcro contact needless say , n't secure enough keep little one working way swaddle she also gets hands bottom swaddle wrap , causing bunch around face , neck , ends chewing waking up i bought mine target , clearance june/july 2011 maybe ? it small , cotton , pink swaddle she 25 inches long fits ok length wise , wrap tightly , 's waaaay big seems strange make swaddle loose since purpose swaddle tight also , mine not velcro fasteners bottom like commentators not sure apparently different 
-1	this sleep sack bad comparisons newborn ones i bought the swaddle arm flaps not completely sewn leaves gaping holes baby constantly gets arms out it also bunches around son 's face night i n't think safe the size sleep sack good my baby 14 pounds 
-1	my newborn seven pounds , newborn size rated 6-12 pounds the `` wings '' ( part swaddle ) oversized , point velcro left order close i wrapped i also issues product bunching face , i assumed due poor fit , seems others issue this product also overpriced , especially since seems i wasted money something n't functional 
-1	first , zippers baby clothes terrible they roll face catch every bit drool puke , whether not bib baby then also serve binky thumb blockers frustrate heck littles need one i suspect idea came someone either not kids , n't spend enough time baby ( anyone else 's ) ever deal puke/drool cleanup binky/thumb management add giant swaths stiff velcro patches pretty awful execution great idea my baby girl loves hands tied annoys , completely unwrapped causes startle reflex wakes the solution swaddle loosely enough allow hand movement , tightly enough upper arms shoulders feel secure time it 's tricky balance nearly impossible achieve overlay since velcro specific needs go fasten correctly , would think would make smaller , 's big huge stiff patches plus work chin quickly bottom velcro straps n't fastened , 're pain neck use they 're also stiff i scratched the whole piece also ride wiggling , even swaddle part fastened correctly ; rides back , binds legs blocks mouth/nose the sensible design element zipper upside , allowing open bottom half midnight diaper changes this might great n't wiggly , grabby baby little one still calm n't move often , i guess mine 's wiggle worm since 13 weeks womb , every ultrasound showed hands near face , not good fit 
-1	i gave review 4 stars great product however , i subtracted star small small 5 months old , weighs 13 lbs 23 inches long ( small age ) he ca n't stretch legs looks uncomfortable halo not make swaddle blanket larger small ( took another star ) i 'm lucky able last long my friend 's kids sized 3 months yikes ! 
-1	i 'm huge fan swaddling wish i done often earlier first son for second son i invested swaddling blankets , including one this far worst blankets i 've tried first , n't get tight enough actually swaddle i even tried son clearly big i still could n't get arm straps tight enough actually swaddled more concerning swaddle band , loose , easily rides child sleeping cover mouth nose extremely dangerous if want good swaddling blanket , i highly recommend thethe miracle blanket swaddler formerly known amazing miracle blanket - solid blueinstead one if child large miracle blanket i recommend trying thethe woombie original swaddle blanket , bubblegum , 14-19 pounds ultimately , not buy 
-1	i agree poster said needs recalled we used fine newborn , i actually loved however , one afternoon i found bunched around 1 month old daughters neck ! she real squirmer easily would break regular swaddles i thought thing would good idea turned dangerous i also filed complaint government consumer safety agency i 'm using swaddleme works much better , ca n't bunch around neck i heard woombie good 
-1	son hated tthe look terror hi face heart breaking it like straight jacket babies now newborn loves swaddled i see helpful neither boys 
-1	i fleece version wanted cotton one summer- shrunk almost 3/4th 's original size : ( 
-1	i 'm not saying quality item blame , concept if need swaddle baby , use swaddle blanket this serves purpose longer need swaddle baby a blanket still blanket ! 
-1	i registered bunch - different sizes materials i knew i 'd try swaddling daughter , seemed easy way it when i first used , daughter easily got hands could wriggle around ( bottom swaddle part ) would wake herself the biggest problem i , though , made holding daughter breastfeeding really difficult i would unwrap could arms free , sack part hard hold i switched theswaddledesigns marquisette swaddling blanket , triplets paisley , kiwi , thethe miracle blanket swaddler formerly known amazing miracle blanket - green w/ blue trim i fully unwrap , wakes less taking entire sleep sack ( like taking pj 's ) many reviewers say great transition swaddling my daughter 13 weeks , 'll try move swaddling soon i try - n't wake much i feed night , partially removing sack , without swaddle part , may not much problem this not terrible product means it 's experience made holding baby breastfeeding difficult 
-1	after receiving 3 newborn size halo sleepsack swaddles loving , decided purchase 2 size small version daughter quickly grew the first time used , breathing sensor went stopped moving ( not stopped breathing , thankfully ) , swaddle cloth mouth nose ! we terrified thought possibly n't wrapped swaddle tight enough , next nap , wrapped tightly ( much ever size small ) watched closely slept slowly surely , cloth wiggled way towards face moved sleep we immediately removed swaddle returned now still use newborn size , n't zip bottom way let bottom legs stick it looks silly , 's much safer i idea newborn size n't ride size small , n't taking chances daughter ! 
-1	it 's crazy i ca n't find sippy straw cup holds liquid without leaking not impossible draw liquid ! this one n't leak unless daughter drops stays time , even leaks little bit but , so hard get liquid straw i hardly without busting eardrum i take sips squeeze straw get air back cup sip yeah , loves i take bottle 's done same goes ones flippy lid thing 
-1	as introduction concept flatware , fine your infant hold feed but actual flatware , sort suck the forks way rounded ( although safe , sure ) actually fork anything the handles short flat , making bit hard hold manipulate cheap , fine play , not really something actually eat

-1	told buy breastfeeding class supplementing bottle feeds breast feeding flow way fast , not slow flow disappointed 
-1	these ok , not really needed there many products there- new mom hard know helpful not i 'd say pretty much without -- save money things really use ! ! 
-1	this product contains almond oil so anyone family history severe nut allergies , may want skip go lansinoh instead a reaction probably unlikely , take chances baby ? ( i wish product ingredients listed somewhere amazon page would helpful ) however , really want plant-based alternative lansinoh , might consider nipple cream motherlove it contains olive oil beeswax instead motherlove herbal nipple cream ( 1 oz ) 
-1	melts place very messy 
-1	i bought bottle smaller size bottle really complicated their lot parts kind pain wash plus baby not like 
-1	in general i always ton research buying product except one well mistake ! i tried theses first weeks baby , big fail ! felt like milk going fast getting sweety pie choke , totally messy dripping i realized well blue internal nipple kind squished permanently areas ( baby bite strongly ? ) anyway i bottle came medela breastpump used bad experience it 's less fancy n't air release thing works i trying next dr brown tomee tipee 
-1	our ebf son picky bottles not like one i n't care either - many parts i concerned extra milk would collect inner outer nipples 
-1	i looking bottle son could use i n't around breastfeed he n't even get use he fussed soon tried it way much effort total failure ! 
-1	my sister paranoid good breastfeeding difficult start wanted son use bottles grandma 's house began working , cried screamed made bottle feedings impossible grandma i tried giving bottle also , watched outer nipple buckle , literally not able latch grandma switched basic regular nippled bottle much better 
-1	my daughter tongue tie therefore delayed breastfeeding we looking something would not cause nipple confusion couldnt suck hard enough nipple anything come the nipple not pliable like real nipple would , fact not stretch this marketing hype bottle nothing like the breast at all my daughter latching nipple shield i pump milk give bottle times not latch we not using contraption also cap leaks and nipple flows even not sucked on and i did read the instructions 100 % we sticking playtex nurser natural latch rubber nipples drop ins system the rubber nipple gets warm mouth feels like skin it also soft i wont look 
-1	this product cheaply made the fabric leash started unravel almost immediately we n't use newborn 
-1	this temporary device due fact bottle small clean push water tube , bottle doesnt force enough liquid tubing order get clean so prevent bateria growth recommended used 24 hours this per medela now , onto review , this stopped working two uses we ended buying regular sns instead the liquid stopped flowing reservoir nipple manually squeeze bottle make flow note this is for breastmilk only formula is to thick to flow thru the tubing and will lead to hour long or more feedings 
-1	highly disappointed stickers not stay wall some , n't our walls n't extremely textured either i would suggest going different product 
-1	this item not i thought would i bought would nice able grab shopping cart not sort 50 find one working belt when i got , i realized straight ( adjustable ) belt two ends clip cart there no buckle middle normally , shopping cart belts two clips hook cart side buckle middle get kid easily this clips small plastic flap hook bars i tucked diaper bag anyway though i admit , i 've never used thing then , different construction i probably would i vowed make supplies joann fabrics n't done yet thing still sits unused diaper bag *update 7/19/12 : never used donated someone else may love i found clips hassle lack seatbelt grocery cart too bad , i good expectations thing * 
-1	i would preferred & # 34 ; string & # 34 ; kind , i 'm sure someone afraid kids get hurt somehow 
-1	this product poorly designed there 's rubber insert flat side 're supposed press child 's head make seal water flows back point two problems : first , rubber rigid ca n't get good seal without pressing really hard the second , biggest , problem rubber insert n't go way edges cup there space 3mm side water gushes because 'd cup positioned child 's head , means water goes ears , sides face even eyes since 's water eyes really freaks kid , 's useless us she enjoy stuffing bath toys though got use 
-1	i bought zapp international trip i wanted smaller lightweight stroller would easier travel the stroller fine trip i n't used months since 's not functional overall i 've really disappointed i 'm probably going sell buy g-luxe maclaren general use what i n't like stroller:1 it n't recline in addition stroller not reclining , baby sits upright stroller , almost like sitting perch like sitting chair 's uncomfortable child nap this huge negative trying sightsee nap time if 're buying stroller use travelling , seriously look getting one reclines 2 it 's heavy so folds small enough put duffle bag , 's duffle bag really heavy really awkward difficult carry note must remove front wheels get bag i thought would great i could put overhead compartment plane , everyone bringing baggage plane new charges i n't even able ironically , i might able put umbrella stroller first class jacket closet plane super compact stroller still needed gate checked 3 it 's awkward open close it definitely takes one adult hands free full freedom motion able open close , means must two adults use ca n't physically attend child open close time huge negative book and 's closed n't stay closed easily one thing i found compelling stroller i bought picture woman quinny website jauntily walking subway turnstile carrying baby one arm stroller one hand in practice ridiculous first , i find impossible carry stroller easily one hand n't stay closed second , must super strong 's carrying 20 pounds arm you need two hands carry n't bag if 're already parent know deal breaker occupying hands is 4 it n't really fold small the fold short , not small total the total size n't much smaller folded umbrella stroller although shorter that n't end useful unless want put stroller overhead compartment plane , like i mentioned , ability extremely limited increased demand overhead storage space i could store unbrella stroller coat closet stroller bulky that 5 the ride really bumpy i 'm not sure better lightweight stroller , solid wheels combined shocks made ride extremely bumpy i noticed used uneven surfaces like brick sidewalks really struggled strollers i 've used modestly uneven surfaces 
-1	poor quality , color fade 
-1	i rarely buy things amazon i never use , due diligent research prior buying anything online unfortunately , product nothing i expected something sturdy , since 's floor obviously putting things like highchair top within couple uses ripped i accidentally bumped highchair i shocked cheapness i opened , totally amazed ripped easily waste money , fold waterproof table cloth half put kids eat 
-1	i baby july 2009 i purchased snugride 32 beforehand lot research i read people 's opinions , based thoughts , concluded would best purchase 32 i would able use one year 32 pounds this logic faulty several reasons , i outline before i , little background : i big baby he 6 months already 20 pounds i feeling might big , i bought seat however , seat almost end life already 6 months 20+ pounds here 's why:1 the straps way short my son maxed within first couple months why n't make straps longer ? why n't another setting two height ? it tight fit we live new england winter not put couple layers we switch convertible car seat soon 2 there way 'd want carry baby much larger 20 pounds car seat you would never use product 32 pounds reason you need stationary seat anyway baby reaches 20 pounds another major problem rittenhouse model particular lack head support infant our baby 's head always flopped side i giving seats two stars looks nice ( i rittenhouse get many compliments nice black white pattern ) , seems work fine comfortable baby first months he especially liked newborn seems cramped now we tight money right ( n't ? ) feel 32 bit waste money you purchase regular [ lightweight ] snugride lower price use first 3-6 months switch convertible seat if big baby , anyway , whether buy 32 not 32 ca n't accommodate large baby while admittedly useful carrier car seat newborn , becomes much less necessary 3-6 months convertible car seats face rear n't worry compromising baby 's safety unless care style not price practicality , i would recommend saving bucks getting regular snugride inexpensive functional carrier seat first months investing good convertible seat later 
-1	worked great days , started developing quirks - like would get stuck one sound would n't turn right away the ipod plug never worked used weeks night baby 's room , slept white noise at three weeks got stuck - could not turn died completely dead piece junk ! tried return amazon com - said long since purchase no refund ! ! ! ! read bunch reviews happens lot it 's defective product manufacturer knows buyer beware you not purchase new baby sound machine every month ! i 'm going try ecotones marpac - way better reviews even though 're expensive but since i 've using fan ten years - 's worth investment me i hope i save others faulty purchase waste money 
-1	i received baby shower gift i excited time unfortunately , baby born i found absolutely worthless ! i disappointed first white noise quiet , days later music stopped working , light would n't turn unless unplugged whole thing ! eventually music started skipping like scratched cd so basically thing i use mp3 plug , 's junk i never use i 'm bummed poor friend spent money stupid thing 
-1	the sound way low likings and noises horrible the lullabyes nice but white noise n't even sound like white noise the sounds go high low enough wake not worth money 2 stars nice blue night light : ) 
-1	i tried hard like sound machine i looking new one son 's fan went kaput we 'd used fan `` white noise '' now 's getting age climbing crib concern i n't want fan floor potentially injure when/if gets unfortunately , i could n't justify keeping sound machine despite attempts convince ( maybe could use visiting friends babies ? ) this one n't worth expense i graco sweet slumber less day & already malfunctioned one way at night , son several times tried adjust machine without success ( he 16 months old sleeping night since 11 months - rarely awakens & always puts back sleep ) i think would take getting used child change white noise night , even quiet fan going addition womb/constant white noise setting machine , could n't get back sleep pros : - aesthetically pleasing- compact enough travel purposes- multiple features/functions , theory , desirable bells & whistles- good selection `` white noise '' lullabies- soft blue nightlight built machine - nice nursing mothers young babies- battery power option allows place shelf near crib better noise distribution ( without concern cord ) also makes easier take places may not outlet close reach portable crib/pack & playcons : - emits blue light ( pretty bright ! ) purple vents around top machine even night light off because 's vented leaves little light spots walls ( like disco ball ) - much light son old enough light distracts sleep even facing wall , could n't help stare way turn off - the loudest setting white noise still n't quite loud enough block normal daytime sounds ( ie trash truck , lawn mowers , telephone , etc ) even door room closed although i could probably make work night , 's way loud enough naps there guide place machine ( hard surface ground optimal sound distribution ) still not loud enough daytime use - this product arrived & malfunctioned within hour the power cord would short bump dresser machine slightest touch plug-in ( base machine ) it work batteries until - with batteries i could n't get white noise shut times it would stuck turn batteries removed - there multiple reports previous 2 `` cons '' occurring consumers , well ? ? internal wiring issues ? ? again , i would 've loved kept machine i think i 'd used birth son , would 've adjusted light/quieter noise , etc , 's used noise fan , n't easy transition & never enough keep asleep throughout entire night i also feel like machine poorly made seems sort internal wiring problems many reviews state wo n't shut night light gets stuck shorts , etc my hope i could replace fan sound machine eventually use mp3/lullabies 's older help enjoy bedtime & make little fun i 'm returning product & hope 's better option time 's 3 years old so tip : looking `` sound machine '' option ( fan blades ) prefer sound rushing air white noise - purchased marpec dohm nsf sound conditioner seen heredohm-nsf it uses rushing air vents adjusted pitch , etc white noise he took right away no bells , whistles just great product serving one purpose well ! 
-1	i ordered machine recently honestly shocked good reviews i first say i 5 month old colic white noise helped us much i noise machine initially but would n't sleep i knew i look options i loved idea one could plug ipod well 2 big problems 1 ) 's not loud enough 2 ) n't even plain white noise i already travel size homedics i put waterfall works great 19 99 i wanted consider graco bc mp3 attachment marpac works great it 's around $ 50 i 've heard last 25 years my best friend one swears hope helps ! 
-1	have sound machine since son born 2 5 years ago about year ago started acting `` wiggy would n't turn button ( unplug power source back turn ) sometimes buttons n't work either i love built-in nightlight , also acting strangely - n't always turn ( , i unplug power cord back shut ) as far music selection goes , 's good not great it n't many songs set loops ( , i would personally find annoying i n't put son ) and 's way ( i found ) go back forward songs my son likes one particular song n't understand i tell wait ca n't hear right away the nature sounds not great - i hoping nice , calming ocean sound n't seem one the one i heard one whales ( sounds scary baby 's room , especially alone dark ) i usually leave white noise sound the sound/speakers okay - kind hollow sound - i really n't bothered using ipod it i think idea good , quality not was tetering whether give one stars two decided one based quality sound do favor get regular sound machine , homedics makes decent one dock/play ipod 
-1	great colors the bassinet is weak and sways in the middle i ended up putting about a 4 '' piece of foam under the bassinet to make it flat and stable the actual pack and play is sturdy but i would n't recommend this version 
-1	good stroller set , reclining stroller seat put carseat pain this not worth pain live northwest rains alot i stuck outside rain trying recline stroller seat attach car seat 
-1	comfy chair features automatically shut 10 15 minutes my child would wake instantly upon shutoff not enjoy toy awake definately much better 'bouncy ' chairs features substancially less cost 
-1	this chair baby shower gift i like many things -it folds flat ( well , almost flat ) ; plush insert ; looks nice ; mobile toy great ; buckle but also three minor problems : -it not bounce it vibrates nice time , not substitute bouncy chair -there 5 pre-programmed songs , volume control they repeat , get annoying -the plush insert not removable , unless `` medium '' sized baby , get way and , two major problems : -it `` sling '' design ( form ) , baby falls asleep s/he slide chair this ok unless small infant , plush insert n't fit quite right , baby 's neck actually get bent enough suffocate this potentially serious problem so , watch baby closely first times use it -the yellow dial ( see photo ) exactly baby 's feet so baby kicks , s/he hit hard plastic come , fisher price - 's one hard piece plastic whole device why on earth would put exactly baby 's feet ? so baby starts kicking , get right away , 's good chance s/he get bruised heel toe bent backwards 
-1	for 3 month old baby toys hard reach , also little toys flat different textures sounds the thing likes bear i later bought taf toys gym larger mat interactive toys play 
-1	this chair two parts and baby lag skin get trapped often : ( we trained , retrain cries doesnot want sit chair now worth ship back 
-1	despite fact price right , i would not recommend product look closely picture see plastic lip frog 's eyes ? that proved insurmountable obstacle daughter 's butt she could n't sit comfortably potty without dumb eyes getting way and given shy two years old i started training , not yet coordinated enough swing legs around this potty might work older kids longer legs , big flop us i recommend summer infant step-by-step trainer it worked brilliantly us 
-1	this cute , not functional my little guy trouble getting legs front frog and uncomfortable sit legs rest far apart the bowl insert also large compared potties making hard wash normal sink i would wash bathtub i ended getting baby bijorn potty boys used problem so trying save bucks i ended spend much ! go baby bijorn 
-1	my son sat , instantly i could tell pee would go right top straight front i n't even attempt , i knew would mess when stood , held onto handles bucket came - i thought thank heavens i n't let pee ! ! ! ! 
-1	many times girl hurt yoo hoo sitting sometimes hard pop bowl empy gross splash daughter likes put pottys back together never get one price better potty 's 
-1	a lot fancy-shmancy potty chairs looked uncomfortable son 's behind , i n't want sitting like 's straddling horse saddle ( one leg side ) but one simple enough comfortable fancy enough cute fun ! it 's well constructed easy clean there 's cute little retractable toilet paper holder seat looks like real toilet child practice ! you push lever `` flush '' -- obviously n't really flush lol and child goes pee-pee poo-poo , plays music encourage child go the annoying thing son pulls plays boy 's pee-pee cover cause 's way easy detach other , seat great ! **********update**********i originally gave seat 5 star rating , hassle give 1 star rating the seat leaks every time 2 1/2 son uses there major design flaw ! when pees splash guard , pee gets around rim seat leaks like crazy & purple handle onto floor i spend majority time cleaning pee pee pee i 'm tired spending day hands knees cleaning floor goes potty this not issue ! ! ! so i 'm looking getting another seat i 've pinching pennies , i beyond frustrated pay anything seat n't leak ! my son uses portable potty seat absolutely splash guard ease hundreds times , never leak one so definitely design flaw i n't understand good reviews 
-1	i bought start potty training second son with first son , i primitive little potty simply closed doubled foot stool this little potty cute , good concept n't clasps snap together you put together let sit i suppose try move , falls apart the back comes i like hide potty guest come , problem i really like first potty i bought better this expensive cheaply made sorry fisher price 
-1	controls n't screwed ! ! they 're completely backwards mine ( slow fast ; fast slow ) i went use first time ( i put high speed test ) nothing happened ! ! that 6 months ago hubby finally figured last night controls switched i wish i known 6 months ago daughter could gotten use 
-1	i thought swing newborn must , i bought one little guy born i chose 1 ) small apartment pretty small footprint , 2 ) price right , 3 ) gets reasonably good reviews here cons , opinion:1 ) first foremost , babies simply n't need swing keep happy our baby , turns , n't need motion in fact , n't really like motion much 2 ) the way seat swing , baby ca n't move around much 're i guess 's probably designed way order safe , baby likes kick ( like bouncy seat ) , may not like swing 3 ) the motion pretty fast even though multiple settings , seemed basically speed , seemed fast 4 ) it 's portable sense 's not enormous , folds slightly smaller shape 's not folded and shape awkward putting car , etc if baby turns one babies needs to swing , 'll probably want invest nicer swing if baby n't need swing , n't bother one 
-1	my daughter attracted colors animated screen so mobile projector believe daughter like decided buy of , job , kept daughter 's attenetion least 10mins time after 2months , mobile stop working you hear music nothing moving for price mobiel i expect go longer 2 months oh , way thought battery , changed , still nothing

-1	my daughter never took did not help fall asleep we remove early 
-1	i gave 1/5 n't i expected the material like gauze weight - completely see little scratchy i 'll keep swaddling texas baby july august , looking something light weight , i bought flannel blanket one test i order the flannel much heavier , much nicer , soft just depends looking but size blankets ca n't beat my two year old sleeps flannel ones night big enough cover shoulders feet 
-1	i obsessed swaddle designs blankets , use exclusively swaddle 4 1/2 month old every nap & every night with summer , i excited discover thinner options however , multiple tries , son would wiggle free lightweight marquisette every time ! i n't know , product really n't work us

-1	it works need nice looking however baby tall ( like husband ) 'm short 5'1 when wear carrier baby legs hit mine walk she sits low carrier its not great fit short women 
-1	my daughter 3 months weighs 14 punds but tall thin she small doesnt like slumped maybe work better head control ? 
-1	it works time someone would would not able figure open i would try teach nobody get right without ample practice it requires much pressure even keeps adults getting i not think good choice 
-1	we installed bottom open staircase - i wish n't bought evenflo it gets job done , opening narrow , i step carefully gate hope i n't tear clothes edge trip holding baby i not big wide person , either the handle stiff tricky use -- basically annoying even used correctly , plastic knobs latch n't depress well -- feel misaligned cheap i expect knobs break quickly i wish 'd bought kidco gate stairs instead 
-1	i ordered i older evenflo gate i really liked well , i got one different the changes n't good it 's difficult adjust n't work way i gave two stars 's getting job done , i use spot 's annoying adjust 
-1	nearly every one must defective the frames bent easily stayed bent ( yes , i know sides supposed bend snap position stayed bent ) also , put , plan keeping i would describe permanent solution rather `` easy remove put '' travel gate from reviews , clear people love n't work lifestyle pre-tested baby came well friend 's baby totally frustrating followed directions perfectly as others noted , directions not easy follow practice understand get work even , extending top bottom sides , placing gate floor ( required step according manufacturer instructions ) locking place , extremely well , grumpy further practice n't make things better i would never use portable baby gate ! uh-uh looking something simpler i would avoid using going many steps time ! again , permanent long-term gate ( crawlers first walkers ) , might work travel gate , nope not i experienced 
-1	i using gates first time i find one extremely difficult uninstall the release buttons hidden view i ca n't make work therefore not going portable/travel friendly maybe husband better luck , i somewhat disappointed product it look nice fit wider openings , awkward use 
-1	update : we used permanant gate stayed place 2 months on 4th time taking , locking mechanism top support broke longer lock this definitely defect gate many complaints issue i not recommend gate unless going leave permanantly not take ready get rid good amazon replace defective units , however , wasteful i wish design defect corrected ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2 minute installation : i hesitant purchase based numerous negative reviews regarding 's supposedly difficult setup ( taking 2 hands , lots time , etc ) i 'm very happy report read very short simple directions { pictures } , gate installed box less 2 minutes ! yeah , imagine goes back teachers told grade school ! very strong tension rods : it easily fit uneven surfaces tension rods strong ( bends wood frames would likely put hole drywall overtightened ) i update let know tension mechanisms break like many reviews mention months use my older child ( ~40 lbs ) climbed gate times not moved whatsoever very stable/sturdy installed properly ! aesthetics : the thing i 'm not crazy mesh - give snag versus non-cloth gates however , keeps active toddler room 's 's purpose ! i 'll upload photo since i n't think many customer images flattering ( make look decent take moments smooth wrinkles hand - biggie makes huge difference appearance ) recommended for : blocking doorway long periods time ( example , newly crawling/walking toddler need keep one room prevent getting near stairs/doors/cabinets , etc ) 
-1	after spending frustrating hour trying install gate , husband i quickly decided return back amazon we brought confine puppy need leave alone house , wanting something easy setup store away went evenflo crosstown soft portable travel gate , thinking would ideal solution firstly , gate not fit standard sized doorways we 'd hoping gate advertised travel gate , would fit small wide openings not so gladly , gate fit hallway , decided set instead unfortunately , soon led us realize biggest problems product : extremely awkard assemble put away the buttons concealed beneath thick fabric , slippery difficult grip the buttons awkward locate hard push the instructions astonishingly lengthy vital order us figure put gate there way i could manage put ( husband ) it n't easy put back travel bag either it took husband i get back ! we heaved sigh relief packed back away , returned back amazon immediately not good product , 
-1	i got jumper thinking use , i assembled put doorway , way close sides door frame it 's not even doorway narrow others i n't think looked safe i returned item got jumperoo instead son loves 
-1	it n't fit doorways wish , otherwise looked like nice product amazon made return process easy 
-1	this claims size flange i use medela pisa this pump emergency back pump i could n't find medela battery pack headed day i took purely yours ( insurance provided , i would never paid ) i pumped car 20 minutes nipples hurt bad everything squished flange i stop milk flow stopped when i dismantled i saw nipples obviously purple my 30mm medela flanges never turned nipples purple i also hate one piece designed flange valve it makes lot harder use hands free pump bra 
-1	the ameda company decided use inserts adjust individual fit woman 's breast positives - if unsure medium large buy one flange get sizes also , breasts change post pregnancy milking stages sizes ready available negative - if woman needs medium size use insert makes difficult see areola line cup properly it becomes difficult see still producing milk for someone not produce lot milk inconsistent problematic i prefer medela model individual flanges even i purchace one 
-1	personally , n't help case i purchased reduce cleaning throughout day , pumping top caring newborn 4 year old running household my nipples small i really needed 25 mm came pump i ca n't find anywhere 
-1	first , i hate pumping it 's bane existence the insurance company sent ameda pump flanges bit small i went online search slightly larger flanges found these if need use medium , need stick medium flange large flange this two extra flanges wash per pump ( annoying ) this also means medium flange fall onto floor 75 % time use blasted things ( blood bloodcurdling annoying ) 
-1	the suction cup horrible , not stick seconds the toy balanced not spin half spin be careful black white part/spinning toy , fingers get caught not much clearance room two parts it removes suction base , baby pull right it not easy clean creepy music ! 
-1	the level music pleasant enough , cute little song the problem i , plays song , two different versions , still song other pretty good for suction cup toys i use wipe little condensation water glass n't take much moisture get stick 
-1	the sounds toy makes annoying sensor sensitive darn thing play shelf closet the sounds stopped w/in month ( maybe sooner ) the toy removes suction cup ( great since suction works poorly ) bulky ( hurts getting clocked head ) 
-1	my 6 5 month old son loves stand alone jumper , hates laying , loves car walker , etc i thought would great addition toys since 's jumper arms ca n't handle jumping likes i insisted needed door way jumper went style it one store time , looked cute fun to get son took husband i otherwise 's pretty difficult one person then smiling fun , started spinning - not bad the real problem though ca n't sit play toys & # 34 ; hang & # 34 ; leaning way one side super dangerous he nearly fell head ! he 's average height size 's definitely not issue this poorly designed product i would not recommend ! even sitting right next could n't fun let alone something i 'd trust step 2 feet away ! do not buy ! ! 
-1	what poorly designed toy i ca n't understand positive reviews i really ca n't just look design ! of course 's going tip ! ! our little guy actually cried contraption he *rarely* cried we live historic home wide doorways i 'm certain hung standard doorway kiddo could easily tip bonk little face door frame i tried tucking blanket around son effort keep centered every time stupid thing moves tips side i honestly think child could actually fall thing it 's accident waiting happen i ca n't believe n't recalled 
-1	i thought i really get one baby , n't really care , little difficult hang we end taking keep way not putting back takes much effort not worth money 
-1	we made liberal use suction cup toys like children we understand need make sure surface clean smooth suction cup fully rinsed trying stick time even precautions , sometimes stay ; sometimes don't i bought toy something similar i bought 8 years ago first child i really n't want something light , n't choice my 6 month old put mouth sits table us generally gets covered food drool he could n't care less light , motion activated there little hole light-up ball allows water ( knows else ? ) inside washing means keep finger hole hope rinse fast enough if food gets inside hole , luck i ca n't figure anyone would make suction cup toy ( presumably use high chair , around food ) not easily washed 
-1	i 've purchased four , two i gave gifts ( oh god ) two i kept us the ones i kept worked two months , never worked the first one i let baby hold bed night it would charge day i let run night that worked month , would n't charge longer the second one i afraid let baby sleep i unplugged let run night two three nights week nights i left base turned that lasted two months stopped charging i 'm embarrassed ask people i gifted , still work i 've wasted much money they really cute work , expensive unreliable i two older style problem one out i purchased , one still works

-1	thought good , i saw much trouble cloth diapers are sorry , working mom not go way back disposables went 
-1	i ordered 4 worthless thirsties limits leg mobility overall rotation the velcro also rough abrasive ; cover not allow baby 's skin breathe , trapping heat moisture 
-1	i bought uppababy g-luxe i really hated orbit stroller heavy difficult fold/open at first , i liked g luxe light easy open close but little circular buttons handles ( thumbs would ) fell caused rain water get customer service nice enough send new ones , also fell 2 weeks then , big problem occurred 10 uses when son ( weighs 30 pounds ) would put feet footrest , would hang wheel cause stroller stop if son 's feet n't footrest , dangling feet would stop wheel cause stroller stop so i stop using month the best stroller ones i ( i orbit , bob ironman , instep suburban safari , uppababy g-luxe , maclaren twin techno , baby jogger city mini ) baby jogger city mini it 's light enough without flimsy super easy fold handles corners bumps super well and 's comfortable son 
-1	it 's nice toy , well-made pretty , baby got bored quickly ( couple days ) now occasionally hits , time accidentally maybe introduced late ? ( 6 months ) on good side , i n't technical problems reviewers : attaches well considering outrageous price , i would n't bought i knew would work short time the two stars mostly price , also n't really work us

-1	i bought thinking perfect match son 's nursery although worked well room , lop-sided i originally set after six months use , fell apart completely ! although hamper cheap , n't even worth money paid now i go buy expensive one , hoping last longer one 
-1	this hamper super-cute went perfectly monkey/jungle decor baby 's room however , case & # 34 ; get paid & # 34 ; terms quality i n't expect handle industrial level use , within first couple days little plastic tubes used give hamper structure pushed ends hamper wo n't stand i surprised reinforcement ends support pieces supposed go oh well , i n't thrown yet , i 'm still working way upcycle sort decorative item 
-1	as last review , put anything easy rip material it 's great idea bad design 
-1	we bought hamper son 's jungle themed nursery at first i happy product cute i thought durable not 6 months use later hamper falling apart not durable i thought it 's ripping sticks use keep , keep popping now i go buy new hamper honestly i would like money back b/c item joke we used put dirty clothes would empty basket full i could laundry not work money listen reviews , i wish i 
-1	we 've 10 months , 's pretty much done it 's sides held 4 plastic tubes ( two top , two bottom ) 3 4 already fell falling ( i e longer held stitching ) and , right next crib , one evening discovered 8 months old playing one plastic tubes ! ! ! she pulled right for next one , 're spending , getting something might actually last , not dangerous 
-1	i bought hamper use daughter 's nursery within months , plastic sticks used give shape torn mesh fabric every time i pick , sticks slide place collapses , making difficult carry it also longer stands , instead constantly falls 
-1	the hamper looks good 's good size store toys it handles side 's easy move it 's actually practical item the complain 's not good quality , i assambelling ripped straight away i pretty careful i 'm bit scared touch cos might rip somewhere else : ( 
-1	i got adorable hamper shower gift baby registry amazon , right wrapper n't stand straight kept falling the plastic bars punctured sides constantly sliding onto floor after months many seams came open completely fell apart and 's not like saw lot wear tear i 'm one picked - son never even access , kept behind rocker so , even though 's cute , 's really cheap 'd better spending little bit sturdier hamper unless want buy another one 6 months 
-1	i bought toy specifically daughter could not remove high chair tray throw ground well , toy easily removed suction cup first time used , ended ground ! ugh 
-1	this toy neat looking googley eyes bobbling head - n't stick anything , making really awkward hand held toy if stuck , would cool toy - , i would probably not purchase 
-1	my 6 month old loved , poor quality three reasons:1 he could pull base easily always floor 2 the paint clear wings easily chewed sorry , paint not count solid food ! 3 the suction inconsistent once area would stick found , i fearful moving cause temperamental 
-1	very disappointed product not bulky , cumbersome heavy , smells like chemical power plant the mattress bonded mdf board , says california compliant formaldehyde , 's not easing concerns mdf never come near child & # 34 ; toxic chemicals one major health risks mdf the chemical concern formaldehyde , aggravate asthma lung conditions , irritate mucous membranes , cause contact dermatitis studies formaldehyde also suggest likely carcinogen , generally avoided & # 34 ; i bought baby bjorn portable crib , i use playpen , n't smell like anything very pleasant materials easy use this stinky i would afraid baby even room i could feel throat close and , i 'm not one crazy people thinks everything kill us , i 'm concerned parent research get mdf babies ' products 
-1	the pitcher great idea save time making batch bottles day , however small if fill 32oz water , add powder , need mix carefully order avoid making mess i spilled formula counter several times the way parts fit together also seem little flimsy , not sure would last bought rubbermaid mixing pitcher instead fits 2 quarts much bigger feels sturdier rubbermaid servin saver white mixing pitcher 2 qt 
-1	i upset product ! ! it mixes well but big but ! ! ! i noticed plastic shredding along shaft probably getting baby 's formula ! god knows much baby ingested plastic shreds its fine shreds wont notice unless really look its friction shaft twisting top hole bad design doesnt matter thing bpa free plastic shreds ! ! ! 
-1	this pitcher small , feels cheaply made i n't love use i feel like rubbermaid pitcher would better plus repurposed do n't waste money 
-1	i wanted love favorite brand pads , fuzzibunz , longer making overnight ( super ) pads but i n't they seem slip , bunch , although pleasantly thin , absolutely hold lot less lead leaking - problem i n't brands these not even second-favorite brand i 'll use backups panty-liners , i 'm disappointed 
-1	i 'm returning product it really n't work - i 'm not sure 's meant infants , n't anything 19-month old except scare lot did n't pull anything nose , congested i tried several times got nothing , followed either nosefrida baby comfynose , got ton snot out again , maybe 's meant younger babies , 19-month old n't old product like work little one grows 
-1	i 've tried one another one add list son still hates regular bulb syringe effective 
-1	not thrilled for price get dr brown set stack use individually lids i thought lid reason & # 34 ; formula dispenser & # 34 ; not use time maybe older i use put food dispense right entire thing sitting unused cabinet 
-1	i cant even explain upset i product it kept falling wall bathroom and kind purpose , ? 
-1	junk does n't want stay wall hard get pink part stay part stuck wall not worth money ! 
-1	i bought crib mattress two 20 month old 's cribs ( one home , another grandparents ) with daily use , lightweight ( 23 lb ) toddler slept mattress home over course 20 months , went nice , firm mattress , soft , weak one like call `` dip '' it fact , become soft allows simple roll sleep cause entire bed creak -- clearly not absorbing much movement body it 's not supportive long term it good beginning , definitely not hold we market another mattress so i ca n't recommend crib mattress anymore one plans get minimum ~2 years i gloated beginning daughter 's life , 
-1	we really like dr brown 's design we n't see bubbles milk nipple slow enough lo n't choke like brand we decided get standard model finding wide-neck made china sadly , lo wo n't take narrower nipple design the narrower neck also means harder mixing ( using powder ) 
-1	time precious i n't want spend cleaning little parts i wish i 'd gotten tommee tippee bottles , similarly priced vent prevent colic , without pieces adding extra steps jam packed day stupid i bottle warmer , tommee tippees n't fit i guess i 'll stick i think work well - i n't really know n't start much bottle feeding typical colic phase 
-1	purchased 2 sets bottles seeing positive reviews i really wish i n't the bottles leak many extra parts clean , 's not worth extra time as new mom , clean sterilize bottles properly feedings hard enough 've hardly sleep , really n't want bottles extra parts make cleaning even time consuming tedious after 5-6 uses , i found one bottles leaked milk feeding ( inner ring stopped sealing properly ) not milk wasted , leaky bottle got front baby 's clothes wet really frustrating ! we ran target purchased set cheap no-name bottles $ 4 00 ( also bpa free ) work better did n't notice difference gas , spit , burping using dr browns bottles versus cheap ones would not recommend 
-1	i using dr browns ever since son born recommendation pediatrician started colicky acid reflux i ordered set amazon recently needed extra bottles juggle home daycare these leak and guess - bottle cover cap not fit snugly dr browns dishwasher basket i bru imitation bottles , ,hmm thats first ! 
-1	i got gift really great babies premie difficulty sucking initially the venting system helped drink milk better but grew little learned suck , used mostly evenflow glass bottles evenflow nipples rings the dr brown 's serious pain wash it plastic parts small holes nooks crannies they include small brushes , really spend time scrub well n't , 'd find built milk residue mold plastic inserts gross ! overall , new parent way tired dealing bottles they glass bottle version , nice option , , still plastic inserts venting system touching milk tedious wash really annoying 
-1	my daughter not use system i bought baby shower there many parts clean using avent bottles past 5 5 months 
-1	these bottles came highly recommended pediatrician help new born son obvious gas problem ( makes rapid `` eh eh eh eh '' machine gun sound ) anyway , bottles leak place pain clean unless stick dish washer 
-1	these really worked baby i n't dishwasher scrubbing inserts drove insane the little bottle cleaner thing comes useless n't reach way tubes i 'm assuming dishwasher would clean fine n't know sure i switched playtex ventaire fell love ! i use bottle warmer n't leaking although condensation collect bottom lid gap i cap bottle , turn upside tap kitchen towel get the parts much easier scrub clean , fact i usually soak everything sink hot water , dish soap little white vinegar so much easier 
-1	this netting fits graco pack n play just right ( even bit tight ) the problem , elastic pulled taut creates gap bottom mosquitoes still get ( discovered hard way ) , whether make elastic goes under foot pnp , whether n't pull way -- way around , i guess instead , bought lilla curtains ikea since made mosquito-netting type material 's super cheap it comes 2 panels one panels fits/covers pnp perfectly drapes 4 sides , touching floor gaps we gather material bottom corner secure big , metal clip weight keeps thing taut even , makes easy take put minimal adjustments 
-1	it small fit playpen ! it n't stretch well either waste money i use cover stroller instead 
-1	i bought crib , simply wo n't even begin fit around please note crib slim type not ornate `` thick '' like one pictured , n't fit , probably wo n't fit , either if tried harder pull elastic around edges crib , netting elastic would ripped apart we , however , use mini-co sleeper ( arms ' reach ) you may also able use bassinet 
-1	i typically love phil teds products i wanted love high chair 's soooooo small ! it n't even fit petite 9 month old ( 50 % weight height ) she snug , hated never complains anything the tray tiny well very cool design easy put together impractical non-functional do n't waste money 
-1	i chair first child baby 9 months old i 'm going sell i loved looks chair drew first place it looks great kitchen i also like idea able lay back baby falls asleep i finally decided get rid multiple reasons 1 ) it uncomfortable kids slightly longer average , really n't comfortable kids age size you also ca n't use harness system tray time n't enough room crotch area either use harness push chair table or use tray not harness system also , straps set correct tightness , puts child leaning back position fine babies n't starting self-feed once start try self feed , ca n't lean forward enough able eat unless make straps loose safety hazard plus opt remove straps use tray safety , straps ca n't removed completely get way 2 ) it nightmare clean the seat , straps , actual chair ( far many grooves crevices ) with first child , used young baby , put away garage refused sit then used short toddler now 9 month old getting frustrated , i going sell chair figure system works better 
-1	the way mat sent 's really hard get rid folds therefore not sit flat floor the matt ok i regretted purchase

-1	this item 2-day amazon prime purchase it supposed today , visiting grandchild sleep however , n't leave seller facility tennessee nearly noon today 's way carrier we 're florida - snow storm route what heck ? prime guarantees mean nothing inducement pay significant sum 
-1	loved feel sheet , however way big pack & play mattress bought i return the sheet loose mattress & made nervous baby could pull & potentially pull mattress i regular crib size sheet company awesome 
-1	the name company really misleading these products made china just sayin ' so , 're looking buy american made sheets , not 
-1	we item baby gift registry received the packaging clearly states backing made vinyl , not polyester only batting polyester this essential difference avoiding toxic materials baby gear 
-1	our daughter spits drools lot , bought save sheets nightly washing pros : - the fabric soft absorbent backing keeps sheets safe - most things shrink lot washer dryer come fine without shrinkage - the sheet saver keep sheets clean long baby n't travel far crib cons : - the cover bit small since daughter travels sleep head n't stay position - the strings hold cover place short thin it difficult tie securely around slats crib - the strings become safety hazard baby n't swaddled since reach grab 
-1	this sheet saver n't even fit crib totally useless it n't wide enough tie unto crib i standard crib not sure problem needless say i n't use 
-1	i laughed loud i opened it small small piece fabric ties it covers 1/4 sheet what chances son wet/throw up /whatever perfectly spot ? some people say get two , dont make bigger charge ? it seems silly not happy sending back sure ! 
-1	i expected something little larger it seemed small i took package i measured it not 14 & # 34 ; x 28 & # 34 ; package says ( description says 29 & # 34 ; , even wrong ) it barely 14 & # 34 ; x 27 & # 34 ; ( would pull tight get 27 & # 34 ; ) i work get tie slats properly i guessing tight , not easy i expected standard crib i understand point -- save sheets little one spits wets bed -- n't supposed pillows crib pretty fluffy almost like thin pillow mine sleep pillow , i 'm not overly concerned , mine 12 months also it n't cover much area , concerned diaper leaks baby mover , one cover n't going work you would much better full mattress pad second sheet ( quick pull night set clean sheet ) my babies big movers since months old , i would hard time figuring put smaller ( big enough middles tend pretty close middle crib time , i still would need 2 cover whole possible area ) really , not worth money better extra mattress pad sheet ( i got crib sheets $ 2- $ 3 clearance mattress pads around $ 10 ) if small cover n't & # 34 ; leakage & # 34 ; area , going need change whole sheet anyway , might well prepared 
-1	this pillow probably cost less dollar manufacture it made thinnest polyester material imagine , poorly sewn together house cheap , lumpy polyester fill , covered satin polyester pillowcase the satin pillowcase best thing item , except fact slick slides pillow constantly ( found regular pillowcase , folded half , works much better ) the polyester fill material began come pillow within day two first use , not child rough stitching poor you , , experience , could probably make something comparable materials wal-mart $ 2 i would definitely recommend something else , pillow - three-year-old still prefers sleeping without pillow - point luxurious $ 100+ pillow tempurpedic 
-1	the concept nice buy silk fabric give my son not use sleep oh well ! 
-1	this pillow still 's original packaging never used it tiny probably ok newborn 3 months not older baby 
-1	this pillow quite small low quality , sort like relatively flat travel pillow my two year old could not use comfortably instead , selected normal , not fluffy , regular pillow one currently use stuffed animals honestly , big enough use pillow , big pillow 
-1	i got pillow 22 mo old son transitioned toddler bed the pillow comes satin pillowcase great curly dy hair like but pillow n't flat toddler pillows flatish needless say son n't use pillow 
-1	i gave bad rating come gate , need newer house regular size hallways doors 
-1	it n't elegant we wonderful nursery set-up i really felt needed rug although jungle/animal themed things around room , not fit for us if entire theme kids line jungle room may nice completes but n't think would fit stand-alone piece room not kids line jungle items plus , really weak quality- terrible flimsy 
-1	the lamp cute works well grandson 's room , however paint flaws not enough return , new item look better one received we decided could touch paint easily enough , us n't big deal , might 
-1	thought looked pretty cool first saw , got realized not lame , annoying well part glows dark dinky little `` handle '' top , shape pacifier makes meant go one direction , flat side annoying , especially fumbling around trying get back baby 's mouth night get ones n't curved bottom work either direction 
-1	there not enough shape nipple part combined heaviness plastic , baby ca n't latch , - falls right weight i would expected much better price i use mam , i imagine pacifier would better i gave extra star seem made well , functionally , 1 star 
-1	it 's pretty pacifier , sadly newborn girl gags the mouth piece way long just wondering pacifier could possibly fit newborn well 6 month old ? ! my fault , thought ordering 
-1	i know says colors designs may vary , i assumed since solid colors pictured i going get solid pacifiers 
-1	waste money ! my daughter would not suck soothe upset sleep ! think spout/bulb part goes mouth weird shape not comfortable suck easy baby keep mouth ! 
-1	i 'm sure probably perfectly fine pacifiers , baby really n't like she prefers spendy gumdrop pacifiers hawaii medical , figures 
-1	i read reviews item i bought i knew would 50/50 chance i would either like hate i ca n't get stick tub walls have tried things help stick luck it inexpensive glad i n't spend i 
-1	i n't even think making , fabric stores sell nylon mesh home improvement stores sell great suction cups as things sold suction cups , suction cups n't suction other hugely important aspect , bag is- bag 
-1	this bag would hold good amount toys however weight toys never held included suction cups i going local home store get stronger suction cups 
-1	good bag not stick tile wall- suction cups horrible wo n't even hold empty bag i 'm going buy different hooks actually hold daughters toys the bag seems good store bunch flat letters/number blocks it n't really stay open bit hard daughter get toys thats ok 
-1	the suction cups cheaply made adhere tile tub surface i 've tried i 'm going return 
-1	what else say the thing died using three times there suction power if lasted three times i would say great pump quiet 
-1	i 've read reviews everyone used says worked atleast 2 weeks mine vibrating nipple ( know sounds funny haha ) doesnt suck dont know wrong i used first time right making loud vibrating noises see nipple vibrating suction cone thingy im really sad im going back school only breastfeed wanted use sooo convenient size carry around madela double pump 4 times bigger carry around spent 60 bucks hoping would help carry breastfeeding go back = ( guess ill lugging around madela haha 
-1	this pump died one month use one month ! the suction went first stopped working i guess get pay and working pain clean although not super loud , noise makes pumping really annoying if want pump reliable , super easy clean use get ameda purely yours , whatever stay away one 
-1	i disappointed bottles i use dr brown 's thought wide necks might good addition bottle supply -- however bottles leak non-stop ! i know 's not since i n't problem bottles i would go regular size instead 
-1	bummed i bought 3-pack took using one realize 's crap we n't rinse right feeding milk odor bad , decided run dishwasher that plastics they came reddish tint smelled even worse these bottles many components take forever take apart , wash meticulously , put back together i 'm busy mama ( kind mama ) n't time they may great bottles time , nowadays plenty bottles engineered goal preventing air entering baby 's tummy we love comotomo mimijumi bottles ten times better heck , even life factory bottles basic nipples work better ! 
-1	let 's start good part:1 ) the bottle seem help reduce gas intake baby 's spit not big ( still spit , not much ) the bad:1 ) many part wash2 ) after 3 weeks usage , bottles leaks , render useless 
-1	these bottles completely not work us my son ended sucking tip bottle , giving even shallow latch ! even look baby picture amazon uses , sucking tip bottle for us , worthless i taking back today 
-1	we found dr browns natural flow 4oz wideneck bottles messy the bottles flow much caused lot spilage newborn granddaughter 
-1	these would great nipples dr brown 's bottles unfortunately , slightly bigger not interchangeable at time , 3 month old son unable use bottles due different nipple size i currently using long dr brown 8oz bottles not wide bottle neck area 
-1	the graduation side bottle at least 1/2 oz i measured amount water multiple devices ( pyrex berzelius beakers , graduated cylinders , pyrex cooking cup , weighing scale ) dr brown 's bottles for example , 3 1/2 oz dr brown actually 4 oz liquid so , parents , beware might feed child concentrated formula use graduation bottles ( may conducive gas digestive/intestinal problems ) make sure measure amount water , mixing , different cup advent glass bottles good graduation , even paint tends flake multiple boilings 
-1	there used doc brown back future movie trilogy involved time travel order correct life 's mishaps in movies , doc brown solved problems scientific genius well , dr brown 's bottle n't appear amaze science genius baby 's gas intestinal upset breast milk not changed dr brown 's bottles playtex vent aire n't change anything either for doc brown , back future for dr brown 's bottles , 's back drawing board the real difference i could see extra parts required washing 
-1	this began falling apart uses i wanted cute , black diaper bag looked like purse cute totally not worth 's made cheaply 
-1	i thought fabric felt cheap black & # 34 ; leather & # 34 ; parts obvious plastic ( cheap thin plastic ) all , i disappointed product returned 
-1	updated review 17 months later purchased liked reusable love skip hop items diaper bag ! ! thought hey refill needed attach stroller etc however strap broke would longer hang attach stroller slider not best it would not hold moisture wipes plenty cheap wipe holders get hold moisture better thing not happy item 
-1	i disappointed product , red closure not provide airtight seal , within couple days wipes dried useless the reviews i read purchasing seemed praise , i looking way take wipes vs whole pack -- big waste money dont buy ! ! 
-1	this thing waste money it 's bulky , i honesty n't care clips stroller my diaper bag clips stroller guess , i take wipes diaper bag i need also not stay closed even closed , i found wipes drying let save first time moms trouble a ziplock bag makes excellent & # 34 ; wipes case & # 34 ; this another one baby products n't really need 
-1	i bought i thought would wipes case i could use one handed changing diapers not much also , red button n't click , n't really close/lock and soon fell 
-1	i guess probably wipes cases problem i use wipes come sealed bag when i tried use case car diaper bag wipes dried 1 day good use wipes day replace new ones next especially summer hot leave car wasted day ! maybe would work winter not i live ! i n't see point bring whole wipes bag ( i use 7th generation honest wipes less toxic ) so i think waste money 
-1	the red closure button n't stay put well often slides open diaper bag , dries wipes the case also bulkier i expected 
-1	i bought looking bigger portable wipe container , reading good reviews i n't hesitate big waste money , red button come quite often regardless properly sealed wipes dried matter days ! i literally went get wipes 3-5 days putting dry ! you live learn , stick one comes huggies wipes , might smaller keep wipes moist easy get 
-1	the case seemed durable couple weeks use red cap broke case would not stay closed 
-1	i 'll make review to-the-point reasons not waste money this:1 it exremely big bulky , bigger actual wipes package it literally takes 30 % diaper bag 2 the red button pops use much pressure3 the wipes dry quicklyi use travel wipes target - cost less dollar , package , need transfer , compact stay moist ! 
-1	this case looks good , bigger cases i bulky diaper bag it 's difficult use one hand slider hard open wipes hard pull will keep use spare around house , would not recommend 
-1	this thing tiny , i think must 3 & # 34 ; total across you would think underside would covered rabbit material , the underside top side , behind ears , little blue block this cover see covers sides , not top bottom blue block supposed ice pack it 's hard blue square freeze , block come extremely cold frost so tell , wants put frozen plastic block child ? i thought point thing to ice pack boo boos ? how 's open cover ? ? would get ice pack freezer put skin skin ? ? no so would put little frozen plastic square skin skin baby ? ? this company needs toss design get rabbit material underside protect baby 's skin ! ! ! ! also , 's damn small , 's like size mouse petco unless plan using sideways , give baby freezer burn time i returning refund , stupid idea 
-1	this might work one teeny , tiny electric cars ? we nissan altima & mirror small , i ca n't really see little man back also , visor mounting system kind not ideal at least car you use way passenger sun visor & available mirror angles n't work well all i would not recommend product 
-1	mirror size credit card , useless 're driving baby facing backwards want able see quickly , not spend 30 seconds trying see tiny mirror also , suv clip comes not flexible enough set right angle look front mirror spend another $ 3 get something like $ 10 brica baby in sight mirror gray 
-1	brand new box , reservoir smells terrible i 've descaled 3 times instructed manual smell remains anytime i steam something , smell food tastes terrible i n't fed baby anything made horrible machine i feel like i would poisoning i n't know smell husband got christmas gift baby n't old enough eat solids , 6 months later , i ca n't return amazon i 've called beaba requested return refund response until beaba responds resolves issue , 1 star remains i continue discourage people buying 
-1	i read excellent review item decided bought when i received package i happy , i tried use product , blender n't work never = ( & # 8230 ; that disappointed , i baby ready first baby food blender never work , broken inside 
-1	i beaba blog giveaway , i n't think i would ever spend money buy one i used mine dozen times passing friend it everything advertised i n't think saves time effort , though you still clean , peel , cut fruits veggies chunks , time saved if anything takes more time prepare baby food beaba simply small capacity you put cup cup half chopped raw food steamer , seems like good amount food however , time steam puree food , end half cup baby food , maybe bit more let 's say 're going make sweet potatoes always great food start babies 's mild sweet pureed really smooth creamy the beaba cook half average sweet potato time i cook four large sweet potatoes puree 7-cup food processor with beaba , start finish , peeling chopping steaming blending cooling , 're looking around 30 45 minutes feed baby also , food coming beaba extremely hot , rightly , ca n't feed baby food hot let cool , adds food prep time anyone serious making baby food going want make baby food bulk most busy moms n't time waste product like beaba makes small amount food time just one hour kitchen sunday i enough baby food last week , not longer i kitchenaid 7-cup food processor i found sale bb & b ; around sixty bucks i would steam veggies fruits stove even microwave , puree quickly food processor , usually making 4 cups baby food time also , one pot , one steamer basket , one food processor much easier clean beaba the beaba streamer basket stained orange first time i used i n't care little parts pieces i needed clean beaba do n't waste money fancy expensive baby food storage containers gladware makes small 4-ounce containers i believe pack 8 3 bucks i would fill dozen time 3 4 different foods pop freezer each night i went bed , i would pull couple containers freezer stick fridge next day come mealtime , fast easy scoop i needed warm microwave after several months freezing heating little blue lids gladware containers would crack , 're affordable i n't mind tossing recycling bin buying another set 
-1	i wanted like machine i changed mind i thought i would share first small really baby food machine you cut food turn steamer take basket done dump food main container blend you accomplish exact thing regular stainless steamer stove amount time i tested i saved time exactly ! the stainless steamer stove also used pot steam lager amounts use forever plus use steamer stove defrost baby food i freeze baby food tiny glass containers i stick directly uncovered steamer stove if use silicone containers put baby food glass bowl i not use plastic cooking i n't care bpa free chemicals plastic leach food therefore stainless steel stove method also safer beaba also beaba water tank coated something it smells funny makes food smell i n't trust either it not stainless others mentioned well i not feel safe steaming plastic water come tank smells funny for blending i throw food bpa free blender yes plastic not cooking exposure time less you could use glass bender stainless stick blender even better i actually well bpa free plastic bender tiny almost like beaba food maker so basically i came conclusion i accomplish thing amount time standard kitchen cookware appliances i tested took exact time ! plus stainless steamer doubles bottle sanitizer bottle warmer i also asparagus cooker also great warming bottles sterilizing i use glass bottles plastic bottles need add water not melt sitting agains metal goes nipples i boil instead cooking plastic emitting chemicals like all the sterilizers and bottle warmers do ! 
-1	i bought thinking would easier two-in-one machine make baby 's food the problem make four servings food time i 'm working mom , i need make two weeks worth food time freeze that means least six batches beaba , would take hours in addition , plastic pretty thin , i 'm afraid put parts dishwasher this means hand washing ! add descaling requirements , thing takes time clean cook with the steamer also n't kind 'off ' signal , 'mommy brain ' walk away steaming , wo n't remind finished might come back long food gone cold throw the food processor blade really inefficient takes long time get consistent texture if processing anything starchy , means gets pretty glutinous time big chunks batch for price , get full size steamer ( chimes finished ) , basic food processor hand blender blend food faster evenly and use products whole family , not limited time baby needs pureed food the black & decker steamer affordable n't present water scale problems machine 
-1	this food processor good making food older babies handle chunkier textures the blade small 's not lot horsepower so beware ! it indeed leave big chunks food so 're looking something make smooth puree baby , not you willing scan food toss mash big chunks and steamer function ? it 's joke you 'll run steamer times food actually cooks softens the benefit i see product baby older chew handle thicker textures it 's helpful 's smaller food processor bigger blender/processor , maybe save counter space ? 
-1	i got baby registry gift i excited finally use baby ready start solids week i spent one hour trying figure blender i used food processors , figured n't hard use i tried different settings , de-assembed/re-assembled blade pieces , made sure jar 'clicked ' properly finally gave it simply not work the motor seems issues , makes noise running not rotate blades went beaba 's help page find following comment [ ] '' the base warped hear motor running blade not turn if happening , rotating belt not contact pulley inside machine in case , either base whole product may need replaced open support ticket us help `` submitted ticket beaba 's support word yet i contacted seller amazon return , since 90 days past registry purchase , want charge re-stocking fee/shipping etc wow , waste time money someone 's precious gift very disappointed ) i used amazon purchase b ) quality product sooo horrible even hefty pricebtw : i ended using regular blender blend apples baby 's first apple sauce meal i know patented product , heck , need pay $ 100+ simple steaming blending i would highly recommend not purchase product ( mind , love gadgets things make life simple easy , plain waste ! ) 
-1	this thing terrible it takes forever steam anything diced carrots took well hour i thought unit must defective exchanged new one same problem it 's not powerful machine the blend function underpowered you keep pausing blend scrape bowl move contents around what hassle it n't make process making food baby easier after steaming expected lift hot basket dripping , steaming veggie water , drain sink , bring back bowl scrape back stand ( n't quite ) blend making food baby took forever made mess n't worth cleaning also real pain after trying several baby food makers i finally found baby brezza it 's cheaper 's awesome one bowl no parts one button steam blend i push walk away lo behold it actually steams blends ! fabulous skip beaba it 's hype 
-1	i tried wear much possible rides interfered breastfeeding i 'm disappointed wasted cash it might work women i 'm 5'8 bit short waisted nothing extreme course maybe 's rode i take nurse time annoying 've got newborn constantly eating you definitely could n't wear unless bulky sweatshirt not comfortable i would n't minded i could nursed so i n't know really works since i could n't wear consistently enough say 
-1	i purchased son still newborn , ended returning i smallish person first time nursing , though i would n't characterize experience particularly troublesome i needed something supportive prop little guy , keep comfortable early months this n't cut : too soft floppy useful , though otherwise product seemed good quality i found `` brest friend '' type product -- something firmer -- worked best 
-1	this n't effective product either sons ( one n't like pacifiers one would one mouth always , allowed ) my wife i also found shape teethifier vaguely resemble well i 'll say testicles i feel bad , 's true to make , i 'll add one thing i find missing negative reviews : recommendation the one teether youngest son does use widely availablethe first years massaging action teether 
-1	our 10 month not like she prefers razbaby razberry teether ( 3 mo till 's fav ) maybe later use weird teether i like description product unusual shape 's i give 2 stars btw i bought $ 15 amazon 
-1	i bought teether infant the package opened taped shut i not feel safe giving baby i n't know used i extremely upset throw teether n't worth shipping back cost wise beware purchase !

-1	i started using thepump january i used day ( not even every day ) after month one pump stop working , month later second bump stop working the company gives 90 days limited warranty since i bought advance , 90 days already passed i bought cheapest one , definitively not worth money update : i contacted company shipped new motor tubes extended warranty babies first birthday so customer service good however , would not recommend buying need pump lot buy expensive unit work longer 
-1	i really disappointed pump it really weak course i stuck contacted company sent new motor part , still weak got medela one much better definitely worth spending pump works well ! 
-1	i originally left great review product , experience 2 weeks ago this pump completely broke vacation using less 3 months ( maybe 20 times ) it longer suction , even replacing tubing unfortunately warranty last 90 days purchase date , 2 months i even opened box so , i went bought medela 1 year warranty , great reputation 
-1	i actually bought pump target $ 74 99 since i shopping amazon i thought place review it i bought pump keep work i medela home cost $ 300 heavy bulky pain lug around so i found pump first i loved it light weight , small , easy use , quiet even worked pretty well not fast medela good enough purposes - one pumping session work i normally pump 15 minutes using medela took like 20 minutes get result , not bad i could lived extra 5 minutes however , using once/day 5 weeks one side quit pumping i took apart everything i could basically discovered 's something internal pumping mechanism i long ago thrown away packaging receipt ( mistake , i know ! ) you ca n't return things store anyway i kind figured 's point ? now i $ 75 item kind works wanted pump one side time which i n't , sits basement getting ever closer garbage can i would suggest not purchasing either pay medela get hand action pump

-1	i disappointed find `` hard way '' mattress contains polyurethane foam i purchased marketed safe the product description states : quote `` made natural coconut palm fiber latex-free foam create completely organic inner foundation '' this not true if manufacturer disclosed foam contained polyurethane - unnatural substance toxin known damage immune systems -i never would bought i wo n't buy mdb products anymore

-1	i love smell great baby could care less he sure loves sophie tho ! 
-1	we regular spring mattress sagged middle since baby loved sleeping foam mattress , i thought 'd get foam core mattress crib we n't expect vinyl cover hard for bed hard , still sagged middle needed put piece plywood mattress keep rolling face middle it 's chore get sleep crib , matter many crib covers put we 've resort getting foam overlay seems make little happier even i thought bed plastic give i would n't recommend mattress friend for next crib second child , 're not making mistake 
-1	plus side light easy lift change sheets , sides : seems flimsy also , thought would fabric feel touch , instead feels like plastic definitely need use padded mattress pad corners covering sewed together buckle create sharp points - not baby would ever exposed , careful taking mattress pad cover could snag actually , disappointed bought recommendation another purchaser website 
-1	these trainers not well made ! they left red marks child extremely loud we purchased store brands try gerber trusted brand first i came across amazon com called dappi 's i glad i listened reviewers purchased 3 pack cost gerber 2 pack i would strongly suggest market look dappi 's give try there huge difference two 
-1	i ordered nipples sore i wanted soft breast pad after washing , not soft i prefer cotton breast pads also , care involve many steps not worth effort i bought cotton pads replace they also stick nipple nipple slightly damp leave fuzz 
-1	like many reviewers , i found pads leaked easily one feeding maybe i leak others i oald oversupply first , second i took pains avoid not problems , i tend think pads , not me i editing add : i believe not absorbant enough due material after researching experimenting several cloth diapers , i discovered hemp bamboo much absorbant jersey , cotton microfiber if looking nursing pads ( cloth diapers matter ) highly absorbant , look something made fabrics 
-1	i really wanted like prefolds they ended really expensive spit-up cloths it says work w/ snappis pop right it becomes vexing baby starts squirming ! snappis n't work diapers we sticking chinese prefolds favorites , bummis prefold diapers oh tried safety pins - ugh trying get pins thick diapers not fun do n't waste money diapers : (

-1	i found sling complicated use they instructional booklet photos n't clear position baby correctly i eventually figured baby really hated he 's normally placid baby cried moment i put n't stop i took he loves carriers one n't work us i would n't recommend babies n't enjoy swaddled i appreciate offer carrier organic cotton ended waste $ 60 us 
-1	not interesting toys bad plastic poor quality already returned looked good picture not good actually 
-1	the tray hard get lined not work well feed kids i ended selling garage sale 
-1	the foam insert seat smells toxic i 've washed several times scent strong my baby 's clothes reek setting he n't care seat much either unfortunately after minutes thing starts fussing lifting butt like feels uncomfortable/trapped so n't getting much use i would hoped waste money us : ( hopefully 'll use booster seat toddler 
-1	this tray stiff not rotate well i brace chair floor push might , chance baby rotate reach different toys- technically toys baby ca n't reach the tray cracks plastic snaps together pinches the toys snap into designated holes stiffly my son also sat strange angle i returned item 
-1	first 's not 3 stage seat seat actually provides & # 34 ; boost & # 34 ; using the seat part exactly flush bottom base i ca n't even understand & # 34 ; best seller & # 34 ; the blue circular part toys cumbersome n't really glide easily circle small section tray remove every time i tried i swear get frustrated not come easy so i tuck little arms inside i pull whole circular play tray head also , one time i manage slide tray put back i narrowly missed pinching little guys fingers i would get bumbo different type high chair together 
-1	6 mo old son using almost 2 months he likes toys come seat , 's things likes seat here cons i observed:1 ) harness wo n't stay tight tightened the buckles poorly made length straps wo n't locked that means harness loosened easily baby moves body 2 ) blue saucer pan holds toys not rotate smoothly baby wo n't able move around , parents rotate baby play toys i think misleading state allows 360 degrees fun 3 ) back quite low not suitable babies without good head neck control 4 ) biggest complain underside blue saucer pan full sharp ridges crevices my son always move legs around feet always get caught crevices we put socks avoid feet cut sharp edges also , parents hold child 's legs order turn saucer pan around , otherwise child 's feet get hurt saucer pan turned my son never sit 10 mins i n't know seating area not comfortable so overall i n't think seat everything manufacturer says i n't think design well thought , materials quite cheaply made 
-1	i saw thought , perfect ! so perfect , i n't want wait shipping spent last $ 40 buy locally i disappointed upon opening see cheap quality overall seat attachments i still opted put together 4 month old son , find interest either a friend mine 3 month old loved though , never know in case though , i quick disassemble product return first summer product i ever return 
-1	this seat poorly made already falling apart my baby sat minute n't like the rubber insert terrible toxic odor no way i 'm letting 4 month old sit 
-1	had funny rubber smell eventuall goes away my kids never really took sitting though they loved toys outside never sat chair long i wish i n't buy two oh well

-1	inside cup , straw come apart put back together easily however falls apart easily when daughter drops cup , straw comes dislocated so next time goes drink , ca n't suck anything it took entire day noticing n't drink anything find problem my poor daughter thirsty whole day cup not pleased 
-1	i agree several reviews - cups awful ! milk erupts top straw creates huge mess i n't know playtex claim 100 % spill proof leak proof i guess need start looking 100 % eruption straw proof also reviewers pointed straws short waste lot milk even obvious picture cups i solve problem using longer straws came taller playtex cups ( also erupt ) i still hate cups huge mess invariably always happens use i 'm still hunt perfect straw cup i really n't think one exists !

-1	i feel i wasted money normally i love the first years products i thethe first years mipump single electric breast pump , the first years quick serve bottle warmerandthe first years soothie newborn pacifiers , boy- products i adore not easy means two week old son busts arms top easily ( 's i get arms stay inside first place ) defeats purpose i purchased thethe original woombie baby cocoon swaddle , newborn short , kiwi greenand worked like magic please n't waste money ! ! 
-1	we purchased daughter falls asleep hour long drive home long weekends her head always slumped forward went sideways awkward position we thought pillow would help it not it 's cute , always asks nodding , really n't help hold head even side side 
-1	i bought yesterday , tried last night restaurant husband i looked like idiots trying figure it n't fit , totally useless way hassle worth i going try another one 
-1	i sent back got refund it 's thin , flimsy , wobbly i expected sturdy like regalo gates , n't made thin , round tubing 
-1	this gate probably works fine keep kids safe place , gate not safe there numerous raw metal edges mine baby could easily cut , especially chews everything i wood gate find much safer this gate not refined not well made i would highly advise purchasing baby 
-1	i installed gate 38-inch wide stair landing at 38 inches , screws almost fully extended , allowing ton slop gate i think 7-month old could easily push mounted pressure points it only works pressure points installed reciever cups must screwed wall ( even , 's still pretty flimsy ) so much gate n't need holes wall the gate pretty narrow ( i 5'10 '' 175 ) i often bang side i imagine larger people turn sideways i n't expect much $ 32 , workmanship bad , sloppy welds overall crummy flimsiness i n't better option recommend , i would n't buy gate 
-1	we 2 baby gates regalo easy step walk thru munchkin easy close metal gate i would recommend later there real problem regalo , munchkin better 1 the munchkin lock lift squeeze function designed done one hand , regalo requires pull back lift done one hand , far easier two hands ( let 's face toddler never 2 free hands ! ) 2 the munchkin additional 3rd lock feature bottom gate also serves determine way want door swing ( also left door swings ways ) the regalo swings 1 direction additional lock feature 3 the munchkin lock automatically pulled closed the regalo must manually locked ( 1 handed operation still 1 addition action time go ) so nothing really bad regalo , better options ! 
-1	this gate nothing hassle i n't going write review 11 month old daughter ( 19lb ) pulled gate , latch came open gate swung , causing fall hit head we gate installed bottom step 36in staircase , wall bannister rail turns gate does not fit size stairway the gate 32in wide comes 4in extender piece so , stairway 33 37 inches wide , gate not fit which standard size staircase ! we jerry-rig two 4x6 planks make stairway narrow enough fit gate my next biggest peeve gate moves we not use screws fix wall live rental , i specifically chose gate install without permanent fixtures how wrong i ! if n't plan screw fixtures wall , n't bother buying gate every time i lean , bump , cat rubs past baby grabs , moves basically leaning forward at top stairs munchkin auto-close metal gate love ! we installed easily screws sturdy tl ; dr - this gate not good value money it not fit stairways 33-37in not secure if , spend little bit munchkin gate get peace mind ! 
-1	i bought specifically 'pressure mounted ' i would n't drill hole walls , flimsy one year old pulled standing holding i wall mount 's still not sturdy 
-1	we number baby gates homes , one least favorite i would not choose opening use often , narrow ( husband i find turning sideways get time ) clumsy maneuver i wish would swing open ways , really deal breaker i removed first spot put another spot use less often , 's still getting nerves i hate high bottom bar , trip time it 's cheap , i would put money toward another better gate costing 50 % 
-1	seriously dislike one ! i purchased opening exactly 53 & # 34 ; , order keep toddler playroom this beyond flimsy way work space first , although metal seems light , not seem sturdy came ( brand new , unopened ) box looking slightly warped in fact , gate not even latch properly ( came open gentle push , less toddler capable exerting ) second , the entire gate held together pressure alone -- extensions n't attach together , merely kept together 2 & # 34 ; overlap ( part extension slides part main gate ) let repeat , no mechanism prevents sliding apart even trying put gate need 3 4 hands keep together this also goes & # 34 ; screws & # 34 ; supposed pressure mount -- ends simply slide gate ( turning fastening ) kept pressure exerted plastic disc outside gate supposed keep screw falling not not work effectively , unsafe if gate ever falls , breaks 5-7 pieces ( sharp , pointy chokeable ) and fall tested 7-lb cat third , beware using wide spaces ! if attempting put extra-wide doorway , thing & # 34 ; pressure & # 34 ; mounting 4 screws not firmly attached structure -- merely slide opening gate require & # 34 ; pressure & # 34 ; keep firmly place when screws fully extended , mere 1 & # 34 ; thin ( 're talking 1/2 cm diameter ) screw overlapping ( not firmly screwed ) extension , again , not firmly mounted actual gate in addition , gate came bent would not latch closed i sorry language difficult understand ( i trouble explaining badly/cheaply thing designed ) i hoping review help clarify real issues product yes , pieces simply slide together pressure mount- sounds easy enough but easy case means not sturdy , safe i looking forward , sorely disappointed was not worth time , money , effort ! 
-1	i bought gate use mom 's house 14-month old daughter it simple assemble , completely insecure installed i installed according directions , tightening pieces suspend wall tight the gate would n't open i unscrewed gate would open unfortunately , loose enough open gate , i could easily pull gate wall if buying gate use suspension gate , buy something else ! the product information says used suspension screw-mounted gate ; definitely not case the gate also really flimsy feeling i 'm willing pay higher quality gate 
-1	chose one explicitly tension mount arrived needed screwed wall , ca n't wall question marble edging , i 'm definitely not drilling into disappointing 
-1	it sure looks like good reviews 148 great ones but , add one , two , three , four star reviews people unhappy product not and i one ! ! ! ! as said poor reviews , get pay for the gate super narrow try carrying child - sleeping one - laundry gate using extension piece ( practically required ) makes gate loose ; extension piece held tension makes whole gate wobbly unreliable best i n't trust gate hold farther i throw , i 100 % positive installed correctly , tight humanly possible you retighten every week , otherwise , gets even looser and latch wo n't meet gate edge ca n't stay locked shut please spend extra $ 20- $ 30 get gate safe reliable this not wishing i bought something else 
-1	we not able install safely due cross-threaded screw the company willing send new one , i decided return whole gate it slightly small without extension included , extension made wide staircase , would purchase different extension direct regalo anyway by point , i would spent going babies r us getting expensive gate 
-1	the pressure mounts n't work well actually apply enough pressure gate n't fall two year old leaning , bends upper portion gate much ca n't close gate it 's quality control never actually tested prototype giving ok production run 
-1	the pressure mount 34 inches felt insecure we added 1 & # 34 ; wood either side make sturdier also used longer screws mounting rings retraining self conscious white bar bottom , not stub toe trip especially top stair 
-1	unless wear skinny jeans people say look good without laughing opening product way narrow i would not recommend anyone underfeed models 
-1	i bought 19 month old son 's room he get crib , wakes everyone else , runs house he also opens door runs outside needless say , needed tall gate keep room i hear wakes give enough time wake also contrary manufacturer states , gate ca n't pressure mounted it slips place sometimes pushes door open even though 's & # 34 ; locked & # 34 ; we not allowed screw anything wall useless 
-1	i ordered top stairs it 's gate gate , opening walk narrow i not large i felt like i turn sideways walk at top stairs , carrying baby , gate not safe it 's easy lose balance trying manuver we got munchkin gate returning one much wider opening 
-1	we installed gate top stairs 7 1/2 mo old baby crawling and , even packaging carpet realized gate not going work and , many reasons 1 ) width opening entirely narrow i tall , thin woman opening 2 inches wider hips this means nearly everyone i know would step sideways 2 ) the latch difficult use it requires thumb pull lever back lift gate while i might able get used , thing worrisome downright burden getting gate locked behind it not naturally close lock back place and , 's entirely easy 'think ' 've locked , fact 's not locked , easily opened gentle push part gate 3 ) the lip bottom must step large if gate n't used staircase , might something i could get used but , top stairs , increases height step - along narrow passageway - would mean i 'll break neck time the bottom line gate junk and , 's designed poorly believe gate poses danger 're trying avoid gate first place we disappointed , say least we also simultaneously purchased regalo 4 1 extra large metal play yard it arrived broken the opening one poles supposed attached stripped we n't even get assembly we returning items not purchase anything regalo 
-1	this gate not work extra parts added we use without extension still , 're looking wider area i would not recommend my husband handy could n't even rig remotely safe not fall 
-1	this gate annoying beginning the gate either normal gate width 52 inches wide i expected adjustable it also rickety if child pull things strong enough shake gate eventually loosen the walk thru feature great i would expect better quality strength something age range gate gives 
-1	4th baby gone tried ton baby gates far worst ever purchased crappy tack welds air bubbles rough edges would probably break week two slice fast moving hand tried putting gate using extensions provided wobbly would not 'pressure mount ' wall tried tightening wouldnt pushed 2 yr old , would much pressure could not open door not buy gate better wide gates 
-1	i bought 2 gates one bottom stairs rooms we already summer infant gate travel fold gate , needed keep kiddo # 2 safe , i know install baby gates this baby gate wimpy/weak could not stand 10 month old crawling/trying stand ! there also least one huge design flaw , gate tension tightened enough mostly hold wall , gate not unlatch if loosen tension , gate door open , whole thing easily knocked small child ! also , not fit 39 5/40 5inch opening correctly whichever way i tried rig we sent back pronto went back summer infant gates super strong , reliable easy install ! 
-1	it 's shame n't work better , like look it 's not obtrusive baby gates unfortunately 's also not stable we installed using tension mount installed husband i able push pretty easily if made tension tighter would damaged walls , though overall n't work 
-1	these gates work , n't great they sort flimsy i find opening way small , especially trying carry something installation straight forward the gate comes two additional pieces depending wide opening the gate not infinitely adjustable width the gates also come cups screw wall added support tops stairs although job , i would n't recommend i sure better products market 
-1	i expected better quality easier handling frankly , i high hopes disappointed flimsy quality it easz enough install fit wide area , difficult close we need re-adjust top screw every day whatever reason gate not close easily the fact seems issue reflected little piece paper comes gate it states difficulty closing top latch , upper screws tight not problem may think , becomes problem loosen point whole thing becomes rather wobbly loose 
-1	as baby gate standard doorway , perfect it comes little cups screw doorway added security/stabilization , gate swings bot ways , easy operate install , tall , i think child would difficulty trying get open so two stars ? because functions standard gate yes , expand 52 inches , i would n't trust extensions baby even cat the doorway i needed 48 inches putting two extenders left room tension screws , i take 6 & # 34 ; extender next i screwed stabilizer cups began install the tensions screws far side cats walking right gate but i n't buy cats , i bought baby tightening point locked made gate completely unstable it jiggled back forth i could see baby leaning falling over rather go return process package , i decided keep small , standard doorway all-in-all , 's not bad gate , 's advertised super wide get point , opinion , 's not safe it may work one extensions , smaller doorway , 48 & # 34 ; doorways , i 'm still looking 
-1	bought couple years ago hallway it adjusted `` '' order remain upright operable i readjusting every days keep range too tight door would n't open , loose would get knocked place completely fall little pressure i bench awhile would n't fall leaned toddler after months i decided keep adjusted tight stepped instead bothering door generally rattly , wobbly , unstable definitely deterrent anything else ( ca n't trust thing , definitely would n't use stairs ) guests problem gates one confusing people getting knocked place i took in-laws never put back up we two gates ( plastic supergate , wood pressure mount gate ) 've using four years ( minor ) complaints looking back , regalo gate mistake would n't take free one 
-1	i installed gate immediately noticed would n't open i thought i maybe tightened much , i loosened half turn , checking see would open half turn the gate would open loose 10 month old would probably problem knocking over i decided i would tighten accept gate would unusable gate i stopped inspect welds , i noticed least 4 different spots super sharp metal sticking there question mind spots could caused daughter injury needless say , gate came packaged back within 30 minutes opening returned i seriously idea passed safety inspections on box even says 'jpma certified ' i longer trust certification thanks horrible quality gate 
-1	we 2 cars hard install product cars i bought 4-5 month ago not work so i ordered replacement , broke times use also just coincidence ? i lazy n't try return i found amazon accepts return 365days i 'm trying return replacement , i get refund time instead replacement 
-1	material looks disposable i 'm not sure i use i would preferred something thicker pay little 
-1	the picture slightly misleading that tub must small toys this could barely hold half daughters toys also , n't stick tub sides it n't help directions box i tried cleaning area , wetting area , drying area , wetting suction cups ; matter i i could not get even one suction cups stick tub sides it would probably stick tile ceramic , like american 's i plastic substance tub surface i guess get pay if tile ceramic tub sides need something small store tub toys might work 
-1	this nice idea like anything thats not washable gets nasty awhile also not fit tub germany may

-1	i really wanted work toddler hates bulb syringe aspirater passion however , aspirator removed snot the suction low i could barely feel if suction higher i see easy would hold child 's nose suck it would faster less tramatic evil blue snotsucker monster i n't know got defective item , n't help i returning 
-1	this great product 's actually working ! it worked couple weeks i thought batteries already dead i replaced batteries started right back when i went use son i got nothing i found i take batteries put back every time i wanted turn sadly i sending back sticking gross smelly bulb works every time 
-1	i disappointed product , especially graco , graco ear thermometer it n't even fit baby 's ear anyhow , nasal aspirator worked great one two times , literally the third time i already put saline drops baby 's nose product stopped working after awhile works , n't work , really frustrating now doesnt even work , two days ! i ended ordering baby comfy nose nosefreda work way better ! 
-1	this waste money purchase i nosefrida nasal aspirator works well used 4 month old baby 
-1	the first time i used seemed dream come true the next day , i tried use suction would n't work anymore , matter i i returned walmart defective i 've read similar reviews i think product design flawed i 'd recommend babycomfynose instead ( ) 
-1	please please please not use aspirator without back ! it works great fresh box , six months purchasing i laid rest garbage it multiple design flaws , largest requires fresh batteries every 2-3 days frequent use and baby congested , need use frequently ! thank heavens i ordered thebabycomfynose nasal aspirator ( blue ) 's arriving later today since one died 7 hours ago , poor baby congested ca n't drink bottle without throwing ! : ( 
-1	i guess get pay not work i ordered replace horrible bulb get anything baby 's nose ! had go back bulb 
-1	not much i hated , baby it 's loud i 'm not sure i ever managed suck booger daughter would n't hold still we much better luck regular bulb aspirators

-1	we 've 3 one shorter life span last its great kids , like daughter , love put fight , last one lasted one cold ! we 'll trying different brand 
-1	item worked well bulb syringe , n't make baby nearly angry unfortunately , baby 's cold lasted longer little gadget would not recommend definitely would n't buy 
-1	nasal aspirator waste money , doesnt work us like another reviewer said , i wish i could give 0 stars for best nasal aspirator simple , pigeon manual aspirator if want advice , dont waste money ! is weak aspirator 
-1	i always used bulb syringe first child it seemed work okay ( though i careful brand bulb syringe i used some work better others ) when second child cold 6 weeks old i in-laws without bulb syringe so i ran store useless bulb syringe ( bad brand ) graco nasal aspirator i bought graco high hopes let tell thing not work it not suction snot thicker water ! and made baby scream cry really pretty useless i used several times finally gave i bought nosefrida recommendations mom friends that works wonders ! my baby still fusses i suction nose nosefrida much quicker gentler effective no gimmicks , bells whistles just simple design works i would n't recommend doohickey 
-1	this cute little bag pacifier , certainly helps snap onto diaper bag -- way always know look 're not digging around binky emergency the thing i n't like squishes pacifier 's not wide enough hold , end folding nipple paci squeeze just seems strange product called `` pacifier pod '' n't seem shaped actually fit pacifier i 've seen pacifier holders cylinder-shaped seem much better fit pacifier even two , without bending 
-1	these things great idea , two big flaws , imo first , quantity hold small , whole set four n't fit enough snack satiate 3yo so may good formula snacks small toddler , 's it 's also hard open i hard time , kids ca n't and snacks eat big fit dispenser hole , lid would taken access ( ca n't ) 
-1	these good small use long period time also 's difficult get stains 
-1	my daughter liked seat ( primo ducka ) really wanted seat handles pooping this little seat seemed fit bill cheap enough i n't mind buying another seat yes , `` fits '' elongated toilets but nothing keep sliding around longer toilet seat underneath - clamps , pegs , rubber feet , nothing ! every time daughter tried sit , seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing pee guard if i start little seat far back possible , 's far get without help ( 's nearly 3 ! ) , feet n't touch fairly tall step stool it needs front toilet seat wo n't stay so i hold place climb not problem starting - need child - problem child knows use potty wants express independence `` '' once sitting seat proper place , biggest complaint starts this thing collects pee the little pee guard pointless from i 've seen pee guards needed kids , not others - regardless sex my daughter needs one - decent one this one deflects pee seat , floor , pants , shoes in short , drippy , nasty mess cleaned every time used extra laundry i shudder think muck accumulating foam vinyl she wanted one handles fine i 've added two simple drawer pull knobs primo ducka potty seat she 's pleased this piece junk went trash 
-1	we listened negative reviews seems like great idea biggest problem slides son terrified going fall , toilet ! he pleaded get one home we purchased traveling since visiting mom , i went store bought one leave we use kalencomm 2 1 potette plus also purchased , larger 
-1	the bottles super leaky baby swallowed much air i stop using waste money ! 
-1	my baby never gas problems used bottles i switched dr brown bottles , problem went away immediately 
-1	i purchased several bottles/nipples started daycare daughter getting nipple confusion gerbers fit onto pump at first , i impressed improved latch n't appear much gas taking bottle after week use , i found nipples retained `` left sitting '' breastmilk smell i could n't get i washed bottles nipples hot soapy water sterilized time time make sure bacteria destroyed unfortunately , another month use , horror , i discovered inner , darker blue nipples deteriorated opening either expanded ( i certainly n't shove anything clean opening surface ) split side nipple ( `` ! ) ! i immediately looked nipples using found every single nipple problem the outer , clear nipple still perfect shape inner , blue nipple deteriorating now , either i toxic milk - i highly doubt - material not best quality i called company next morning told problem i nipples the `` customer service '' lady took accusatory tone said i must cleaning wrong 'd never heard i told i using nipple brush clean inside nipples way get tip inside she said i needed use soft cloth really ? then offered send replacement nipple pack `` '' ok , um , thanks i received replacement pack immediately put use after week use , i inspected guess i found ? ! the tips starting split - 1/8-1/6 '' side blue inner nipple i called company tell got different customer service rep apologized , asked i caring nipples offered send 4 replacement nipples asked i would please send defective nipples concerned i said sure i got replacement packaged , opened , found not 4 replacement stage 1 nipples two bottles stage 2 , 9 oz size i 'm not going bother sending defective nipples i not person 's issue reviewers online reported occurrences save money try something else these n't appear long lifespan i like idea , n't last we 're switching another bottle 
-1	we tried milk got caught nipple part husband kept pour back bottle not sure i 'd n't right , i tried couple times problem ended using dr browns 
-1	i n't know i 'm wrong , i turn right side , keeps leaking ! 
-1	i wanted baby able breastfeed use bottle , i searched high love bottle would n't cause nipple confusion these seemed best reviewed i tried first time son ( hard sucker ) could n't get milk i push blue inner piece get fall outter nipple once still could n't get much i gave mess clean when try get two nipple pieces apart lot gets stuck two thus lot waste mess occuring clean overall not work us 
-1	by design , milk build inner outer nipple i found design frustrating two reasons : ( 1 ) if 're carefully measuring tracking much baby consuming , n't know much milk lost nipple ( 2 ) if baby getting breastmilk bottle , 're losing `` liquid gold '' if 're limited milk supply , frustrating the instructions suggest happens normally , happens , follow directions cleaning bottle ( i e discarding milk ) 
-1	we purchased bottles primarily breastfed baby based wide based nipple good reviews his latch nipple mimics breastfeeding well , going back forth bottle breast successfully since 1 week old however , husband i found way milk pools inner outer nipple , essentially impossible feed last 1/2 oz even let drip back bottle quickly invert -- ca n't get last bit milk stay inner nipple long enough drink it i 'm not willing sacrifice 1/2 oz milk everytime use bottle we retired bottles much happier tommee tippee 
-1	the first weeks baby born i pumping bottle feeding i researched brestflow bottles figured would best breast/bottle feeding combination bottles while idea two part nipple sounded great made mess ! when baby done bottle i went disassemble lots milk came leaking out- gotten trapped nipples i worked hard end kitchen sink i stopped use breastflow bottles immediately another thing i n't like flow- although stage 1 slow flow seemed come fast we switched dr browns bottles using premie nipple found worked wonders compared ! i would n't recommend breastflow- i ended using bottles store milk 
-1	okay , product stinks the concept great , product n't the spinning thing quite hard not comfortable lay long periods my 4-month old much happier laying position something 's much softer , like boppy pillow ( n't , likes one daycare ) we 3 tummy time mats , one far worst quality it constantly bunches pilling even though 's barely used the bunching issue even worse since mat/spinner set designed baby would really grabbing onto mat spinning - 'd think mat would little sturdier grab onto , way , 's really hard baby grab spin 
-1	i bought i threw old squeeze bath toys since i worried mold inside loved idea could open clean problem sort hard inflexible tough squeeze , not really much fun kids ca n't squeeze , never fill water plus kids figured twist open , want open close ( usually bugging help , means i 'm spending bathtime opening closing ) not exactly play product intended they super cute , i 'm disappointed

-1	okay , maybe i n't read fine print carefully enough but gate `` swing '' title , description also says `` pressure-mounted '' i thought i getting gate would swing pressure-mounted wall when i received , i realized swings use hardware drill holes wall if pressure-mount gate , works like cheap , plastic gate step time ( creating another hazard baby ; trip carrying him/her ? ) also , i try pressure-mount green `` locking '' mechanism n't work properly i ended returning !

-1	the spoon fork redeeming things set they held well although , fork not really pointy enough actually sphere anything spoon shallow hold much anything the plate bowl immediately started peeling i toss uses i would not recommend set simply not durable

-1	i got store without reading reviews beforehand , i wish i my baby not liked sippy far i decided try one straw , thinking might take like reviewers said , cup indeed spill proof unfortunately also sip proof i not problem getting water , basically bite straw and suck time , comes fine but i ca n't imagine 10 month old baby able figure maybe works well older toddlers , 's definitely not babies 
-1	my wife i excited find bottles our 14-month-old son looked ready kind sippy cup , already tried number , including nuk , made sense given preference nuk 10-ounce milk bottles no dice -- sippy cups assortments annoyed , mostly reason n't like tip head back drink ( milk , 's usually reclined bed morning chair afternoon , n't want turn every drinking moment reclining event ) so , interesting thing quickly took straw once discovered loved sip liquids straws , purchased these we followed directions carefully , assembly/disassembly not terribly onerous so , ask , downside ? well , unless want boil , dry , autoclave straw every week ( not often ) , will mold mildew issues straw i 'm not sure something chemicals straw made , fact one-way valve limits airflow straw sitting , something else , hot , soapy water , blowing straw , air drying nothing even bleach wo n't completely stop , wants risk kid drinking bleach residue ? we found mold growing straws four different bottles 24-48 hours washing ( verify mold completely eradicated immediately post-washing , scrubbed insides straws pipe cleaners ) the sanitary issues much stomach -- i n't want accept , brown/green colonies growing straws much risk i think 's related one-way valve straw would recommend straws one-way valves parents 
-1	the closing switch top hard close it spills drops milk every time i close and closed takes considerable effort open it its parts bulky annoying wash i much prefer nubys i got i'mm thinking trying playtex ones 
-1	it 's impossible suck water cup ! got sale target i know disappointed there much better sippy straw cups ! 
-1	leaks , pain wash since straw always dirty playtex ones work much better n't leak 
-1	these second attempt find good sippy cup straw i 'm disappointed yet i thought , based reviews , would better cups i 'd tried - many parts - really n't sure , one less piece straw , dismantle flip top get straw apart ( ultimately resulting number parts ) and tricky get apart they also hold less liquid others finally , most disappointing , leaked previous brand i tried - lot so , ultimately , i 'm going end using water buying others everything else now i need go ammend review 
-1	my daughter never used she could n't suck hard enough get liquid i even tried using straw i trouble straw do n't waste money 
-1	we tried number times little one , 8 months she 17 months , still ca n't use she gets little , gets frustrated i tried drinking suck really hard sort bite nipple get flow adequately it seems like great far spill-proof could withstand lot throwing , 's point 's hard suck ? what waste time editted : at 24 months old daughter able use succesfully , however n't last long since chewed end broke longer safe use i not seen replacement sippy tops , 's end cup 
-1	this cup kind pain assemble -- fold nipple half squeeze place , run thumb around bottom lid make sure 's sealed , still leaks maybe defective , seemed leak valve hole i ended tossing couple weeks cleaning floor every use ( never problem extent nuby cups , even take & toss cheap cups ) 
-1	i purchased one months ago baby born cost $ 70 aprox i see much expensive ( almost $ 100 ! ! ) honestly i think theme beautiful hello kitty ( i 've worked license country ) materials not good enough ! ! it polyester anything , fabric not nice , looks bad quality stiff would 100 % cotton things would completely different i n't think material makes justice beautiful character theme only great fan hello kitty might ok buy i would n't recommend set , worse price i n't think 's worth i decorated baby 's room entire collection everything looks cute fabric bad i feel sorry i n't choose something else amazon hope sanrio takes note choose another licensee manufacture stuff , supervise material good enough baby i would n't sleep stiff material ! : ( 
-1	these straw cups leak , standing , laying , upside , n't matter , always leak straw ! liquid comes straw simply screwing lid cup i figure kind pressure equalization milk juice squeezed cup sitting upright that , liquid expanding slightly gets warmer either way , complex straw unit , really able accommodate whatever issue is if child drinks sippy cup , stick if 're trying graduate different kind cup , try regular cup go dripping mess 
-1	these cups leak cup owned ( lot ) if want good insulated cup try munchkin click lock sippys , zoli-bot straw cups these ones start leaking second put top even cup half full- starts pouring top straw ! we threw trash 
-1	at first thought product great taught 11 month old use adult straw within one week , days saw problems sometimes straw gets stuck n't pop 's open top these cups fact leak not whole lot if product says 's leak proof , i 'd prefer leak proof , not little after thrown times , part slides straw became loose there also scratches one cups actually n't `` click '' lock it easy clean , though i use dr browns nipple bottle parts brush clean straws 
-1	it standing straight counter milk start coming straw we ca n't figure problem fix 
-1	this cup would great , except fact hard clean little parts , put back together it definitely n't worth money i 've since purchased brands straws much easier clean easier child use 
-1	i bought two yesterday since toddlers taken straws well , plus traveling they not cheap , even target price they leaked immediately ! i made sure i n't fill cup , still leaked ! when i open cover reveal straw daughter drink , explodes ( , not exposed heat elements ) i 'm pretty angry , i wish i 'd looked reviews purchasing i 'll look another reliable straw cup right , sippy cup sitting counter paper towel , 's still leaking ! i 'd return , 's obviously `` '' point it 's open used what junk ! 
-1	first one great , i bought another one leaked , bought one try leaked gave one try final purchase one leaked ruined many bags car fridge anywhere else cup it slowly oozes milk straw regardless whether 's closed , open , full , half full , near empty i n't know i lucked first cup sold product , 's not worth spending $ 8 majority n't work 
-1	it heavy i afraid would fall middle night ended going dreambaby stove top guard instead 
-1	pros : they are really soft ! ! they sustainable material they good size wipe they great `` tooth '' grabbing poo cons : ca n't dry dryer : ( but 's gon na separate 30+ small wipes drying , risk missing one ruining ! absurd ) if put dryer , do unravel trust reviews air/sun drying leaves super stiff the corners `` roll '' time shrinking personally , i hate wipes they 're useless now 've shrunk small i ca n't even use cleaning rags ( they 're like 4x4 ! ) 
-1	glad see n't happen , i thought maybe i done something wrong when i purchased wipe warmer gave free , i 'm glad i curious i heard lot good things bamboo wipes , absorbent , sustainable , softer while maybe true , good wipe falls apart ? i sew finishing edge one side keep unraveling they small might not problem beginning bigger `` jobs '' clean , 'll end using 2 3 i 'm not large person , 5'9 '' i washed , i could fit one hand when cleaning diaper i prefer bigger wipe maybe 's personal preference i would n't recommend buying , i found thirsties better , 're i reach 's not pee diaper 
-1	these given us gift they shrank washings made really small given eight inches square start the trim material shrank main material buckled rendered impossible fold stack after washings , ( total maybe six times washer dryer ) started look like wool sweater left moths ; hole filled thread bare really disappointing

-1	my toddler really loves pull plugs wall put back outlets this seemed like perfect fix not exactly it 's flimsy the backplate door come apart easily my toddler shake door hard comes one day , somehow turned entire unit upside ( empty ) ! plus , thinner plugs fit case , not one stiffer cord like vacuum cleaner computer cord 
-1	i bought 8 i excited try we installed one quickly realized larger plugs n't fit thing most plugs need covered n't standard plugs if standard sized plugs need cover great it would helpful got rid internal plasic around outlet this would allow larger plugs used this product not i mind i 'm dissapointed ca n't use larger standard plugs 
-1	it 's big i returned cause not expected do n't like product around baby it 's harzard 
-1	sounds like good idea must sitting work properly i n't quite think whole day my thought use nursing one breast capture milk maybe mothers bigger milk producers work not much 
-1	when i saw product , i thought would perfect solution save leaking milk , however not work number reasons first , 's huge ! i ca n't even get bra ! i wanted use actually wear i n't think intended you ca n't really move much since completely open top milk leak i guess would work breastfeeding catch milk non-breastfeeding side granted n't move much unfortunately i keep looking another solution 
-1	it 's great concept theory , actual product big , bulky not comfortable you receive one saver per box i expecting 2 pricey quantity 
-1	dang things huge ! ! ! ! im mean , large breasts , big honest , didnt even use so big ended putting cup catch stuff instead ( home ) 
-1	man ! this thing huge i thought would small discrete 's size hand i also bought o-cal-ette cups seems better choice two i n't think i using product o-ca ; -ette cups : http : //www amazon com/gp/product/b002ukxljk/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i03 ? ie=utf8 & psc ; =1 
-1	this way different i thought i received mail the part 're supposed wear bra probably 4 times size actual boob looked ridiculously uncomfortable plus , idea save milk kind terrible system seems like would pretty messy anyway , i returned quick glance , knowing i could never make use 
-1	might i short torso i ca n't sit fully straight nursing 's really not user friendly to save precious milk i 'd suggest getting avent 's breast shields it 's smaller fits nursing bra feed do n't get though leak ounces per feeding 
-1	my daughter not go anywhere near `` teether '' - 's way big mouth compare size normal pacifier , 's huge i n't think i purchasing she 's intrigued colors , hold hand eventually throws - 's not worth paying 
-1	my daughter never took i think maybe big mouth ? everytime i gave one would take mouth chew green part drop 
-1	okay - i 'll admit sometimes i purchase baby stuff looks cute , not functional i love fabric softness aden + anais line if never used sleep sack using sleep sack small baby , work fine but kid got big enough squirmy figure zipper , worthless the main issue lies zipper - thread zipper together top sack , right squirmy baby 's chin if putting baby sleep dark - good luck also , zipper zips bottom sack closure tab hide this perfect want baby something play crib our baby unzips gets feet stuck opening we actually think dangerous use anymore i 'd suggest summer infant sleep sack - fabrics n't cute however , design fabulous ! it 2 zippers - threading hooking together you put baby sack pull top one , gets covered fabric making difficult little houdini unzip wiggle if need midnight diaper change , pull bottom zipper easy access if never tried summer infant , would probably annoyed aden+anais would n't known better solution sorry aden+anais ! you cute unpractical ! 
-1	we needed back sleep sac since baby taken puking night we sleep nest love , unkown reason decided try something different the main thing dissapointed item thinness you literally see fabric thin i thought would least somewhat substantial nearly weightless totally see the sleep nest got amazon much nicer since thick shoulders snaps , lay baby tuck two simple snaps zipper this one provides warmth if not ripped packaging opening it i would returned maybe use summer totally not worth price item 
-1	i rarely review products , i love aden + anais , not meet expectations i tried double check description n't find anything lightweight version the sleep sak received gift ( frog pattern ) much thicker , sturdy zipper overall better quality one this one likely used summer , since lightweight -- holds the material zipper flimsy whole thing already wearing 2 washes part wonders 's counterfeit ! 
-1	received yesterday , washed baby wore last night the zipper busted morning ! the zipper plastic imo poor quality we a+a muslin blankets ( almost year ) love big disappointment 
-1	while putting sleep sack first time i poked hole finger ! i trying put arm tore ! ! i love , although i feel fragile 
-1	i really , really want love sleeping backs they soft , super cute , popular however , zipper issue big problem after two washings handful wears ( within one month purchase ) , zipper fell sleep sack huge safety problem given intended used babies i many aden + anais products i generally love fabrics -- super soft lovely but zippers sleep sacks safety concern if order , check zipper every use make sure safely wo n't present choking hazard child 
-1	i told i needed strip diapers so i bought shipped house i used strip diapers however didnt work the diapers came wash way went i wont waste money product but i guess live learn 
-1	even reading reviews complaining seat high average baby , decided get anyways some reviews said fit baby fine , said high even lowest setting i thought average twins ( 6 months ) would fit , different walker already fit fine this one leaves little feet hanging good three inches ground ! my boys average height i listened reviews , went gut now instead going trouble returning , prop pillow underneath hope one day actually able touch floor , hopefully start walking 
-1	my average sized 10 month old could not even touch ground shortest settings and reading reviews couple websites seems common problem save hassle disappointment , go another brand 
-1	i looking side hip carrier comfortable attractive this not i constantly rearranging trying straighten waist band shoulder cushion riding order comfortable 
-1	i avent bottles i happy naturally i purchased avent sippy cups i not impressed cups they leak i specifically wanted cup lid could put purse bag this cup lid , lid hinged stays child drinking my daughter distracted wanted play lid i wanted lid removable 
-1	i really really wanted love i probably would exchanged ( arrived broken snap ) the pattern scrumptious memory foam squishy even three month old i could see n't long enough i totally willing pay prices memory foam changer please ah goo baby , read reviews fix length ! ! ! 
-1	save money buy medela pump style motor works fine get lot milk pumped pump beware jagged edges breast flanges loose pieces plastic last thing want plastic get breastmilk since could n't return item , asked lansinoh directly new materials breast pump good responsive customer service overnighted parts right away still n't like new parts ended buying medela pump style advance great 
-1	ive owned several hand pumps second electric pump i old lansinoh pump ameda purely so i accidently dropped broke i read reviews decided buy lansinoh pump i figured changed , must improved wrong i like closed system , requirement , top priority it also work awhile got second star but loud really loud like cant conversation loud im pumping right new ameda i barely hear this lansinoh affinity worked , pumping exclusively daughter , 9 months i started thinking i supply issues i really bad days i couldnt pump i normally finally occured may pump i called lansinoh suggested ordering new valves i nothing changed because i didnt save receipt ( time bought crazy , rsv , etc ) option trash i understand not replacing without receipt would exceptional customer service so i buy another one i went back ameda i love much get price amazon 's reason buy affinity , opinion 
-1	i love jujube products , i going return just not functional when i transferred things regular wallet , iphone smaller case barely fit front pocket also , card insert seems big , wrong shape , wallet - makes difficult zip love idea - able stick diaper bag take run store not , 's not going work it needs stretch give fabric makes sense i ordered vera bradley turn-lock wallet see works better love amazon always - fast shipping return policy excellent normallly ju ju be products work really well , not one 
-1	i bought primarily slip resistance bpa-free unfortunately , slip resistance nonexistent the rim around bottom plate equivalent rubber band keep skidding i suppose offer tiny bit resistance , i 'd say maybe 10 % less likely thrown floor lightweight plastic plate it extremely light , like cheap plastic baby plate we using baby anyway , seem like added scoopability plate , bit easier grab things rounded compartments unless child lot trouble picking things plate bowl , though , i see reason buy plate edited two years later : we 've discovered much better use plates ! they perfect paint tray children sitting table painting paper with blob paint compartment , relatively slipping ( children know better pick , could wanted ) great little ones painting i 'd really recommend 
-1	so , maybe i something wrong terrible we week i hate i really excited i like idea organic cotton , leaked every single time my son gets slight rash microfiber i hoping cotton would fix i say good thing , rash but not absorb he 20 months old not even wear hour without leak in mornings i change 8 right leave take daughter school , time get home 9 already leaked diapers i much prefer flips thirsties aios i going try organic cotton flip inserts instead and take forever dry i find helps flip top layer cotton around diaper , even easily take hour half dryer i tried put drying rack 24 hours later felt like come washer they also stain easily , n't huge deal since one sees still not pretty save money 
-1	in short , i would definitely not buy diaper again pros : *very good quality , like bg products*snap fit adjustable*comfy baby*they absorb lot pee*good seal around legs butt prevent leakscons : *takes forever dry there 3 layers thick cotton inside not removed they take days dry line , even arid socal i put dryer take long time dry well this defeats purpose buying `` green '' diaper it also shortens diaper 's lifespan destroying waterproof layer elastic *cotton absorbs bit slowly , fast stream pee leak side ( true nearly cotton diapers ) *stain fairly easily*does not fit small babies ( less 15 lbs ) *somewhat bulky 
-1	i like product expands use single stroller makes double huge help convenience pushing around two babies likes : can push two babies one stroller , loads front back not side side makes easier maneuver store aisles , easy put take offdislikes : the babies end close together , i not sure would work bigger kids right i putting infants stroller , fits one way baby rumble seat face backwards means either look baby back seat i seen used friend 's double strollers think still better option it similar city select stroller also converted double stroller i liked feel whole stroller better i made original selection strollers 
-1	the stroller not designed properly 2 kids when toddler sits rumble seat , face inches bottom infant bucket seat he 'll bit space i 'm able put baby girl actual seat , still - not ideal would better faced also- hard turn corners 's much weight front 
-1	we not best experience it 's well made fits stroller nicely , concept better execution when smaller baby i true infant , older child makes stroller heavy maneuver when infant gets little older sit either seat , one child view constantly level child 's feet i also stroller frame replaced twice uppababy b/c i think weight larger child sitting rumble seat caused folding joint malfunction uppababy 's customer service great , really n't use stroller kids , b/c 's not comfortable ride anyone and loved vista one child too bad we spend walks babyjogger city select tandem 
-1	no grip bottom slides everywhere dangerous ! ! ! i one rubber backing lot safer buy store see 
-1	baby slides ! pushes legs slides ! sue manufacturer unsafe product ! got ta return one get 4-sided instead 
-1	it 's convenient , not durable took not 3 days material started get apart in 3 weeks threw away 
-1	this pad works well , beware california 117 flame retardant material question i use grandson comes visit 
-1	i got great reviews i received , i disappointed it flimsy , not firm felt like would not last month plus plastic-y texture smell big turnoff ( even though would cover changing pad ) i surprised poor quality given reviews good price i returned got naturepedic changing pad instead much expensive ( $ 99 ) glad i - world difference i guess 's always getting pay the naturepedic one firm , durable high quality so looking cheap throwaway pad , could work surprised poor quality - fingers could touch squeezed 
-1	i got case fit bill i prefer 4-sided la baby one it fit better counter 4-sided good case i need contain mess 
-1	decent changing pad , i wish i would waited week order was $ 24 i bought time i received listed $ 15 : ( still good product , i could used $ 10 things baby 
-1	i bought along cute velvety cover son i found instantly leaky boys=the cover needs washed often this pad made waterproof fabric i started using without cover after week , pad stained gross not even bleach could remove discolored areas the fabric porous also , vinyl ripped us ! i ordered la baby changing pad next works great without cover 2 months looks brand new still 
-1	this one first time parent purchasing mistakes now i child , i recognize item bad idea ! it quilted - meaning tiny little holes punched outer plastic cover shape adorable animals cute - not practical it used additional cover , impossible to clean and something impossible clean really bad idea pad change poopy diapers ! within couple weeks 10+ diaper changes per day , run clean changing pad covers ( obviously ) this thing immediately stained needed used without cover , amount scrubbing get rid stain while cleaning , `` material '' got tiny little holes i not get out anyhow , long story short recommendation : do not buy ! get changing pad used without cover needed , wiped clean easily 
-1	there small timeframe tub super useful when son first born , light push sling water , i pouring water , getting goosebumps since couldnt semi-submerged he born 8 5 pounds now , 4 months 15 pounds , pushing sling little better , working fine i foresee starts getting mobile , i going trouble keeping sling , already wiggling quite bit n't even sitting yet the sling not adjusteable , come washable it easy rinse get soap sling tho , seems pretty comfy i looking design little closer , later use , huge plastic bump middle tub , i 'm assuming assist little one start sitting , looks uncomfortable , i 'm reading everyone elses reviews babies n't able stay supported bump what i thinking i try son gets point folded bath towel completely underneath butt , comfort , grip n't slide water something the little plug bottom changes blue white water hot , 's pretty nifty feature , i like side pockets baby wash rinsing cup now behind baby 's head would go , two pockets i assuming prevent overfilling tub well defeat purpose n't drain they hold water , collects soap residue , next time fill tub , old dirty bath water sitting tub baby you would turn whole thing upside every bath , time trying deal drying watching baby ? i drilled holes bottom two pockets work properly i really wish i would purchased different baby tub , good features , things done make tub functionable update : just predicted , son 5 months old heavy sling he still n't sitting unassisted yet , tub nightmare stage he freaks little water begins pool tub , holds breath wiggling , floats right little contoured spot bottoms so , hump middle tub jabbing middle back floating awkward little bath tub ! i refuse fill , even though i never leave son 's side bath , n't safe ! i 'm lowering one star and towel idea i did not work it clogged tub didnt drain , son floats , towel hectic bath time ! 
-1	this tub even terrible daughter newborn she either not water sliding sling water at 3 months old i still use sling slides hump inside supposed keep and yep ! she still slides sling half water gets cold quickly i hate bathing liking less also 
-1	the main problem flimsy thin velcro attaches `` holder '' stroller wo n't keep anything upright , liquid put holder spill 
-1	not worth money if use angled slots umbrella stroller cup holder stays , since one strap fabric , nearly impossible keep cup upright the weight anything put inside angle holder i velcro hook stroller handles , i cut small notch top holder passed hook 's velcro strap thru give support it seems work better , never good plastic holder it work sippy cups , not cup coffee fyi : slots work right side stroller 
-1	ca n't say enough waste money thing n't stay stroller n't keep stuff cold n't heavy enough paperweight basically useless 
-1	it 's nice i personally think bit bulky heavy smaller baby i keep taking nine month old cause smash face cry 
-1	i quite disappointed it n't teach baby hold smooth ball roll ball the hard plastic part goes around ball hold two sides together really bumpy thick it keeps ball rolling straight , hard teaching baby roll back it 's like rattle baby shake throw my 9 month old n't interested , though and i surprised able see little screws hard plastic part it n't look safe 
-1	looks like dog toy we thought much bigger actually the rubber not softest ratteler inside could get annoying not bendy thought for price not worth least give dog cheaper buying dog toy 
-1	there eight exposed screws baby einstein product - i going attach photo show while adult fingers ca n't get rattle 's holes grasp scrape , placement screws easily reached tiny baby fingers my daughter already gotten fingernails caught caused pain terrible ! i purchased rhino toys one instead much better one-piece construction , also soft plastic easily grasped baby hands - baby loves i love http : //www amazon com/rhino-toys-81031-f-oball-rattle/dp/b00188xw26/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid ; =1363012209 & sr ; =8-1 
-1	after receiving gift , i contacted company produces toy ask whether plastic contains bpa , pvc , phthalates i received form reply , indicating plastics comply federal law children 's products failing actually answer question regarding content plastic i wrote back , asking detail never received reply my child likes toy much everything goes mouth ( whether 's intended not ) , i ca n't let play 
-1	i excited get ball 5 m/o twins thinking would easy grab hold i rec 'd amazon i found plastic not soft scratchable also peeling one area seems poorly made i returning not getting replacement b/c i dont want boys trying chew i also agree another reviewer ( i wish i read i ordered ) interior side plastic flat sharp edge may not good baby fingers like grab shake things ( mine ) it good idea not well made 
-1	i bought thinking : & # 34 ; oh well , baby einstein , good & # 34 ; wrong it hard plastic play , specially & # 34 ; worm & # 34 ; middle ( baby 5 months old smacks pretty much everything hand ) babies wo n't able put mouth & # 34 ; worm & # 34 ; hits head , oh boy ! crying time ! it might good older baby ( push back forth like regular ball ) not babies learning grasp 
-1	my son not like he 7 months got he 11 months not touched toy ever 
-1	this awful the small holes around caterpillar plastic circle goes around ball makes holes underneath small it truly upsetting jump shower screaming 9 month old finger stuck one holes i threw trash 
-1	please not waste money item ! it 's horrible ! it not work ! and battery special c battery $ 6 ! i changed battery twice thermometer not work what waste money ! it pulled shelves sent back manufacturer `` shame '' message ! 
-1	i like exchange tips , comes handy fever reference guide the thermometer claims take quick temp worked perfect first time used after one use , takes longer cheap therm got hospital so disappointed ! 
-1	we used thermometer less 10 times last night , daughter screaming inconsolably , i grabbed thermometer check rectal temp , would n't even turn really ? dead battery handful uses ? the idea good , interchangeable tips , spend money better setup work need i bought target , n't read reviews first , wish i after reading reviews , i 'm not even going bother replacement batteries , i 'll get better thermometer 
-1	ca n't really add anything new scads awful reviews battery died 4 uses inaccurate slow now i 'm amazon looking another thermometer 
-1	to simple difficult well fixed i think needs third point fixation better adjusted 
-1	i guess people found helpful , i registered but i tried filing newborn 's nails , nothing happened i think would 've taken ages file nails on flip side , safe since accidentally filing baby 's finger wo n't hurt this one baby items i never never use 
-1	vibration really strong i worried `` overfiling '' baby 's nails i also purchased sister law agreed vibrations strong the file metal , well , i n't see metal gentle baby 's nails i would not recommend 
-1	this got worst thermometer i ever seen it amazing slow trying take temperature kid ( 2 5 years old ) armpit adapter , starts 94 0 increments 01 every 90 seconds , even get normal temperature > 10 minutes , let alone get high temperature forget never happen even using normal mouth probe , took 10 minute take temperature wat 4 degrees so really really slow really inaccurate nice idea , horrible construction : - ( 
-1	i bought item another store , saw trying find manual online you take temperature spot 10 seconds apart & give completely different number every time this 3rd thermometer bought & expensive & still completely useless 
-1	this thermometer consistently disappoints , last thing i want child potentially running fever second guessing results thermometer i ended buying simple rectal thermometer , used great success this one would say probe attached ( one ) , would n't register reading , would register reading clearly wrong a huge disappointment relatively expensive thermometer 
-1	i agree -- thermometer way complicated counter-intuitive imagine trying use screaming sick baby middle night it take 20 minutes locate instructions ( 4 pages , lots fine print ) read figure out for example:1 confusing buttons it 2 buttons color size not labeled tell on/off memory the messages get press wrong button n't prompt next 2 ambiguous error messages `` lo '' `` lo '' different error messages whodathunk ? like anyone going remember lowercase o means getting air ear temperature `` lo '' measure whereas capital o means `` lo '' battery epic fail skip ! should get negative stars 
-1	plain simple n't work the apparently simple design 2 buttons front misleading ca n't get thing work right on top insists cleaned , even immediately thorough cleaning lastly perhaps importantly , little one hated placed inside ear another bust form safety 1st 
-1	i hardly ever give bad reviews i really hate unless 's big disappointment issue this binky clip not built last for price i expected bit the metal piece end completely rusted the elastic split apart the fabric become rough i paid $ 1 haba pacifier chain ( free shipping sign amazon mom ) i 'd advise anyone purchase this not worth money pay three dollars something cute last ! so sad falling apart rust = -1 starsplit elastic rendering usless = -1fabric loosing 's softness = -1price = -1i n't really think deserves one star , amazon made give one 
-1	i purchased one bottle sampler pack local grocery store went ahead ordered two pack liners amazon i going vacation n't want wash parts daughter 's regular bottles there warning printed bottle says `` warning : do not microwave boil , liner could burst result injury '' seems simple enough , n't heat contents liner could burst i wanted sterilize try bottle daughter , i disassembled one bottle boiled parts 5 minutes stove well , i took parts water bottle shrank 2/3 original size ! i little annoyed no packaging say not boil plastic deform ! all warnings liner , nothing outer bottle itself annoyed , not deterred , i still tried using ( deformed ) bottle daughter see would take drop-ins could use vacation i could longer use measurement bottle , nipple , ring , top bottle perfectly fine , tried it epic fail ! she hated nipple terrible gas eating ( normally use nuk bottles , problem different shaped pacifiers nipple formula nursettes ) we tried two feedings setup , tried pushing air well leaving is this not work us i wound returning unused nurser pack liners it seems like good idea i liked fact would less stuff hand wash , n't work out if choose use , remember , do not attempt sterilize outer plastic bottle !

-1	poor rating baby sucked half air half milki liked thought going come handyi would probably not recommend 
-1	these way expensive difficult use want use cloth diapering covers ! ! my much easier solution cloth diaper covers ( mostly pockets ) use extra pocket inserts i you purchase inserts separate pocket diapers , 're much cheapers prefolds you n't deal folding prefold maneuvering get diaper cover ! the prefolds super bulky folded diapering these pretty useless burp rags , ended using blankets coverage my hubby i comfortable holding baby chest instead shoulder , needed move coverage baby moving around ! we ended using changing table it seemed every time i would bother put elastic cover changing pad , would soil ! then get cover baby still naked table ! these prefolds easy keep baby butts pull get soiled it 's easy slip another one ( not ) baby 's not touching cold , rough changing pad finish diapering ! 
-1	i disappointed quality changing pad it made thin , flimsy material - definitely not & # 34 ; ultra plush & # 34 ; it also fits standard size contoured changing pad loosely , making look unattractive well due loose material not i expecting description great reviews item 
-1	i bought diaper amazon recommendation friend cloth-diapering guru- i idea polyester ! it says nowhere amazon page i finally went thirsties website the entire lining microfleece ( part touches baby 's skin ) 100 % polyester ! if ok , 's fine however , i n't like idea synthetics hold moisture right next baby 's skin no thanks i use cotton flat diapers normally wool cloth cover messy , n't normally leak i excited trying fitted diaper , i know work , i stick real fabrics i guess diaper make nice gift someone n't mind polyester they may work well holding liquid , gee , 's polyester does i ca n't good faith rate well uses cotton outside 
-1	the quality crib great ! ! ! ! but not come instructions alot screws missing terrible 
-1	i decided splurge second son 's mattress i bought first son regular mattress without considering materials off-gassing , etc seems nice mattress heavy n't quite fit well pottery barn kendall crib i always jam corners mattress seems slightly big crib the mattress also seems slope middle sides newborn ( less week old ) somehow rolled crib side swaddled i would not buy mattress 
-1	i n't know stop getting moldy since matter small amount water sitting top spout design flaw , probably necessary create shape duck ( whale ) 
-1	this another one adorable kid things come advisory : design product wholly dependent used spout shower diverter of course , spout n't one little whale doomed start i wish i realized issue i thrown packaging i would definitely returned even swapped flippers sturdy zip tie little whale would n't stay put ! i 'm giving 2 stars 's cute , n't merchandiser character i pretty sure right kind faucet work fine 
-1	this cute thing , though i n't really quite understand 's full purpose , except spend money n't necessary i thought would cute , without special plunger spigot ( third knob turning shower ) n't stay completely useless 
-1	i loved cute highly recommended amazon it falls completely slightest bump very disappointed looking new one 
-1	we bought spout cover based reviews adjustable strap hold whale place faucet unfortunately strap not lock place whale slides faucet our faucet standard kohler spout without shower diverter : [ ] my thought spout shower diverter handle whale would stay place the whale cover everything stayed place us i would give 5 back drawing board one help hand getting beaten protecting little ones head hitting spout 
-1	i ordered bath spout cover appeared top fully open able accommodate faucet we stationed germany faucets tubs/showers designed quite different states needless say , not fit matter i adjusted ! so buyer beware : not `` standard '' bathtub faucet , keep looking ! ! ! 
-1	our spout knob shower closer wall instead end spout , completely useless it 's bummer whale cute serves good purpose maybe i missed description somewhere , oh well 
-1	i excited get n't stay faucet it slides right off- maybe n't shower/bath knob faucet ? i left cute really annoying falls constantly 
-1	too large , fell faucet also not soft made hard rubber not soft 
-1	we non-standard flat tub faucet this slides right only purchase item standard faucet tub stopper top hold 
-1	love whale wish hole design top little larger there hole top pull knob turns shower this hole stretches allow larger shower knob , bit pain fool if plan use bath spout cover tub also shower daily , not best choice if not , cover adorable , made high quality materials perfect size 
-1	& # 34 ; fits faucets & # 34 ; not fit its cute , wo n't able use too bad , faucet protector fit baby 's rubber ducky themed bathroom 
-1	did not fit spout just falls very cute , waste money we kids careful 
-1	the duck cute might work bath spouts ( hence 2 stars ) , not stay our bath spout gets slimmer towards front duck fairly big long , adjustable wings duck place even making really tight not keep duck it keeps slipping off as daughter seems like duck , see whether use something else home , far i not able come creative ideas in summary , bath spout cover completely useless us 
-1	as soon put slides right , i not shower knob faucet , i think would help stay waste money , come amazon buy another one 
-1	i n't notice colors may vary i thought i would receiving green , blue , orange pacifiers son instead , got purple pink pacifiers lucky ! yes , uses , yes , 's called girl strangers see ! i n't want get stereotypes , etc , really , want specific color , n't order 
-1	did absolutely nothing , make breasts sensitive they big wear public anyhow 
-1	even though helped pain , i could n't wear pressure made leak much they 've sitting drawer months i really disappointed 
-1	these not worth cost these not particularly helpful made already enlarged breasts look ridiculous 
-1	these gave lot relief soreness until gave miserable case mastitis not recommended 
-1	like bottle air passes baby releases sides without blue pipe bubbles would go milk make noticeable difference these kinda wide tall , glass naturally bit heavy overall difficult hold 
-1	i love dr browns 3 5 oz glass bottles thought essentially little bigger i so frustrated however i got 4 oz bottles home washed ( i ca n't return , nuts ! ) i realized top/opening little bit standardized size evenflow/dr browns3 5oz/medela bottles this means ca n't connect directly medela pump , i ca n't use medela storage covers also , vent system also tiny titch longer 3 5 oz dr browns vent system , ca n't mix & match very frustrating i prefer 3 5 oz ones standardized opening 
-1	the bottles keep breaking warming milk the bottles warning `` extreme temperature changes may lead breakage '' heating via pot water lowest setting stove we bought four bottles ( 2 2 packs ) using weeks already two bottles crack/break i also using born free glass bottles fine it frustrating since i pumping milk - everytime bottle breaks , i losing milk bottle , plus baby already hungry 've got start heating new bottle do n't waste money , milk ! 
-1	first thought getting 16 cases but reading reviews came understand getting 12 hard cases i found one honest review days ago , little late i received case- 1 hard sided case , expecting 12 even 16 on top took long time arrive disappointed 
-1	i returned i could not bear see crib i 'm sure probably job , certainly n't look nice they lot bigger i anticipating i ordered natural fleece ones perhaps another color would nicer , large i ended wrapping baby 's crib rails satin ribbon instead it looks much better n't seem like biting much wood 
-1	i bought ahead time worried mother spent lot money baby 's crib my son ended huge teether i found numerous times crib teething crib guard it soft easy put crib it also looks nice the thing i would liked longer it 4 inches short baby 's crib ( i would imagine cribs length , not sure common issue others bought product ) but complaint overall i would still recommend product saves crib chewed little teething baby update : my son 1yrs old chewed wood crib two spots i 'm not sure able chewing material n't protect well enough pulled material back ( since n't snug fit ) chewed wood so , looking back , i think good idea , child loves teeth things larger crib different product may work better ( want save crib ) 
-1	i randomly got pink , 15 month old son n't really care the spoon really flat n't actually hold food well ; either food wo n't get onto spoon i end pushing finger falls the fork n't really spear food either , i end put food tines fingers feeding toddlers really messy , require lot messy work part get food ! got mini forks spoons elsewhere trick ( meant super-fancy table settings ) 
-1	i gave product two stars work keep daughter cabinet pain get cabinet open want get you take entire contraption cabinet get inside 
-1	the flanges fine , inserts pain @ * $ ! the wo n't stay put it never fails i 'm putting pump together middle night , insert flange end falling floor i 'll wash dry i actually start pumping when i already sleep deprived , fighting breast pump last thing i want middle night 
-1	we currently use tushies covers they brand diaper service stocks offers customers cost ( profit made buying covers offered convenience ) those little expensive ( around $ 12 ) , thought would give shot after , different diaper covers ? these came mail immediately changed baby tried one first , i pulled package , felt cheap it seemed like plastic shopping bag something the rest cover also seemed cheap i n't like elastic back i imagined poop getting right away i also n't like kushies tag right front-middle diaper i 'm not big fan branding like i tried remain optimistic , i put disaster , it ill-fitting ridiculous the crotch diaper massive i right size , not look good i faith would protect anything we took immediately returned i n't even want leave little see would work we ended ordering tushies covers happy they worth extra cost now , i appreciate much more i honestly n't see reviewers could rated high maybe 's i started higher brand ? maybe n't know could much better ? 
-1	i used brand new ( washed hung dry ) leaked the moisture wicked outside cover fabric around legs ended soaked i change baby frequently i would n't consider heavy wetter definatley wasnot problem cute not worth money spent 
-1	i using thirsties covers primarily i tried cheaper alternative the quality lot lower covers i sizing definitely not one size my son 4 months old way big still , i ca n't attest leaks , washing , etc i n't able use yet 
-1	the first time i put diaper baby boy , made regular sized poop , leaked ! i n't diaper blow since switched cloth ! ( 3weeks old 's 3months ) poor quality work well i would probably consider sewing new velcro well baby gets bigger i n't think hold well ! 
-1	the pros ? it 's cute , cheap that 's it functionally bites as others said , hook-and-loop closure n't work long unlike diaper covers , 's secondary loop tape close tabs wash this means lint collects like crazy it also seems low-quality general it worked fine month ( i bought late march ) , started popping loose every single time i put daughter all twitch tiny bit , comes loose moreover , fabric thin , one good pee come fast i realize 's big difference paying $ 8 $ 13 bummi cover 're short cash ( i ) , 'd really much , much better going somewhere like cloth diaper nation diaper swappers buying used bummis buying one new 
-1	we loved spoon set new , uses contact hot food , 's melted deformed little i think 'll great salad , fruit ice cream , definitely not hot food 
-1	as reviewers noted , easily removed motivated toddler time flat i installed 4 doors house n't bother , door really wants get , 2 year old problem removing locks i 'm not exactly sure , takes split second 're i definitely would n't use door child unattended 
-1	very disappointed product i unable use not much space push buttons sides turn open door i turn handle , bottom lock rubs door frame & makes near impossible turn open door 
-1	i first time mother , tried disposable nursing pads well washable these ones far worst i tried ! they leak got bra/shirt wet numerous occasions i recommend la leche washable nursing pads madella disposable pads 
-1	it broke first couple uses , not accurate temp measurement pretty much toy , n't called temp guard 
-1	not really sure suppose take anything babies teeth gum massager wash cloth works better purpose purchase toothbrush 
-1	fingertip toothbrush really small gets stuck finger barely get not fan

-1	first , soothie pacifier attached monkey not well designed gumdrop pacifier the soothie circular disc smooshes baby 's nose sucks pacifier , whereas gumdrop designed around nose second , soothie awkward angle one end sewn monkey this would good enable baby push pacifier n't want anymore but newborn n't ability keep pacifier mouth , whole reason i bought product i found actually works better place puppy upside down insert pacifier baby 's mouth third , monkey light i wish weighted bean bag sort my son big strong ( 15 lbs 2 months ) twists wriggles crib monkey n't stay chest we longer swaddle the time wubbanub works 's wearing zippered sleep sac hoodie tuck monkey hoodie/ sleep sac actually stays place 
-1	i kinda bummed soothie n't clipped monkey , sewn means sterilizer way attach pacifiers kid takes kinda lame 
-1	i desperately looking solution pacifier always falling 2 month old baby 's mouth making cry hysterically particularly i 'm driving i read reviews thought product would lifesaver i disappointed first , pacifier comes toy flimsy , 's not quality actually one buy separately also , way sewn mouth toy , pulls pacifier baby 's mouth making even difficult baby hang pacifier without toy i waited door receive unfortunately huge waste going back holding pacifier 
-1	i excited buy item 4 1/2 month old baby he love kick feet i thought would great however volume terrible even volume second noise spot i barly hear unless i get real close it waste money 
-1	bought son the sound low unless making sounds , i ; even think hear ! 
-1	the piano good size , soft easy clean cloth , tied something order baby enjoy it 's heavy hold if try hold baby play , well good luckthe sound coming piano faint , ca n't background noise going , want baby hear music the baby push fairly hard get keys play music , 'll them the turquoise color little feminine taste - boy i wish neutral color overall , not worth $ 29 , 's sure the music virtually almost impossible hear not worth cost want , means 
-1	the baby really n't play i 'm hoping grow , 's 8 months still n't use , even i play 
-1	the voice low baby hear surrounding exactly silence , rare 
-1	my daughter pulled , yes , one hanging objects it n't hold attention 5 minutes the beams went flat rather quickly uses climb i would not recommend product anyone 
-1	there n't enough volume adjustment , sound projection work we ended getting rid getting project soother called soundspa mybaby we love one son uses every single night 
-1	the music pretty nice not annoying however , images really n't interesting i think baby finds pretty boring it n't seem soothe much either 
-1	the music colors mobile nice n't swing it starts stops seconds plus , 3 figures , since not move , not really capture baby 's interest i would recommend going something else 
-1	this product misleading it seems photos spin nicely dual layer toys ; however , not spin i 'm returning 
-1	have used bag less four months long outings little one , n't often the handle one one side seemed coming loose three months last week i zipping closed zipper fell i definetly would not recommend product anyone very disapointed , i thought since product came trusted name would good quality not case 
-1	i prefer medela brand i think one messier trying get pumps i always spilled also zipper broke months 
-1	i bought bra hoping i could wear clothes work , pump continue work - not much i n't try pumping bras i guess i n't realize bulky would , way could wear thing outfit , except heavy sweater the option taking work putting every pumping complete waste time , takes longer put open regular bra , pump slightly cover shirt i wearing i wish i n't bought bra impractical 
-1	first , contraption pain put you struggle zip get properly 1 use i found preferring hold pumps one arm type one hand rather spend 5 minutes strapping dang thing on it also uncomfortable i felt stifled thick fabric , worst , thing hangs upper area provides zero support boobs the bottom loose hangs a better designer would designed stretchy fabric ( something ) underneath provide support underneath boob push whole area up i wanted like , i really it would glorious i could used hands free type ! ! 
-1	i brought help pump im working notice n't really work bottle start filling it starts dragging bra wo n't able hold therefore pump not really pump effectively you end still needing use hand hold bottles does n't really help working something i probably not buy worth try 
-1	this ok first i 36 f g cup , depending level engorgement , n't need pump often n't necessarily double pump first now i back work full time i need pump least twice day : morning everyone wakes , work lunch with schedule , frequent pumping not possibility , plus i hate it 's painful , even right size flanges i 've used twice daily 2 months that 's it this bra completely stretched it n't hold bottles place initially would hold got full , 's way stretched i gone slightly 34/36 dd ( e ) cup ribcage returned normal i lose last bit preggo fat , i hope coming soon the thing way sized , still fit i could never stand bottles like model especially not i expected suction-ready i bottles propped thighs , means hunching uncomfortable terrible spine i get side i use hands massage one time you ca n't massage effectively bra , take whole contraption put bottle flange back together get breast i think i ca n't actually recommend 
-1	i really hoping hands free bra would answer aching back time consuming pumping unfortunately i ca n't get work well if tight enough actually hold pumping bottles painful flanges leave mark breasts if i adjust comfortable i hold bra makes mostly worthless 
-1	positives : - fast accurate delivery- hands free pumping not need additional accessories for- adjust size , make tight loose want- provides good support pumping ( i e sagging breasts ) negatives : - difficult get pump flange opening ( especially problem sensitive / hurt nipples - yikes ! ) - sit back ( i sit recliner home , not laying back , i slightly leaned back ) , bra not let flanges angle milk flows properly - i hold flanges entire time pumping , n't feel great- difficult get - i n't like zipper design at all ! - thick seams ( adjust bra back ) not comfortable , rub hurtoverall review : i really liked idea single pumping system sometimes i forget pack/wear pump ease system i get work without way pump handsfree that said , pump ease system comfortable easy use - negative not supportive ( breasts sag somewhat since essentially tube top flange openings ) i wear addition bra that said , i would n't purchase simple wishes ; matter fact , i pump bag case i forget pump ease - i hopeful i wo n't need use ! 
-1	took forever put n't keep bottles close enough body work correctly plus , time take shirt work ? once i learned hold bottles left hand forearm right hand free iphone-ing , i never looked back 
-1	i naive , takes 10-15 minutes drain breasts , although i 'll admit it 's boring holding bottles i pump , putting contraption use small amount time multiple times day 're already dressed wearing bra ridiculous it works , uless takes long time pump , 's not worth , 
-1	again , another good idea babies/mothers however , size bra hard fit every specific body type if get good fit , might good product the price item also outrageous i 've seen similar diy models online probably good fraction price 
-1	my breastfeeding pumping painful experience ( many issues blocked ducts , mastitis , thrush , vasospasms , milk blisters ) in general breasts extremely sore ( baby five months still sore ) i hoping use product hands free pumping but due pain , extremely uncomfortable hassle put on/off this sitting drawer i gave using two painful attempts 
-1	this good product free spirits organized enough use maybe i prudish , i felt stupid walking around things i cringed every time husband walked room i friend found godsend , especially returned work pump just not 
-1	when i looking product , i started breastfeeding i like i 2 hands 10 minutes ? ? can i least look internets phone ? ? so i got bra here 's thing : pumping sides saves 10 minutes getting stupid thing situated takes 10 minutes you could argue takes amount time , hands free stuff know , honestly , maybe i bad thing i n't exactly jumping jacks kitchen wearing it kind precarious honestly - best solution - throw podcast hold ( one - half time , i find i n't really care 10 minutes ) there 's plenty baby products burn money this sounds like going open worlds possibility n't 
-1	cut 2 holes old sports bra voila ! a cheaper , better fitting , better looking alternative overpriced product 
-1	the material seems make skin itch around breasts i 've never encountered reaction quite like materials perhaps breasts become sensitive since i 've given birth started pumping/feeding , i every time i use bra , i get itchy breasts red marks ; especially underside i 'll try re-washing 
-1	i bought trial pack , starting experiment cloth diapering boy mistake ! super bulky good overnight pee , child poops likely bathe clean insert hard get pocket dont know hated son wears overnight 
-1	we ordered daughter great maybe first couple uses after , pull ties longer worked could not tighten close we basically twist bag fold hoping smell stayed nothing leaked we made work sake not wanting order , recently ordered couple others amazon 2 kids unfortunately , 'd never order 
-1	i 've wet bags 2 years okay the drawstring gets stuck , bad i replaced string something slicker try alleviate issue it 's better , still frustrating it 's one lays pretty much equivalent plastic bag ( ie shopping bag ) wash reuse i keep diaper bag dirty/wet cloth diapers hold 2 diapers n't really `` large '' , good size use online order another brand , i 'm tired fighting drawstring 
-1	these bags nice-looking worked decently week two however , drawstring twisted first couple weeks use became difficult open close when dirty diaper hand squirmy baby table , n't want pry bag open hands , working back forth opens i recommend not purchasing wetbags 
-1	the phrase `` get pay '' comes mind looking pump i 'm lactation consultant well rn i tell clients stay away pump thankfully not see sale stores i purchased one around 2004 design pumping nightmare came pump many reported sore breasts using pump the suction strong also using pump repeatedly falls apart milk gets upper chambers n't i called customer service instead helping problem simply told others put pump back together dr brown 's course medela manual breast pumps great prices work better one 
-1	if ur like think `` oh , couple people got bum models mine wont '' well , maybe one lucky ones open ur box find pump weak 5 minutes pumping u get couple drops , item not returnable ! the sticker box open says i still plan however calling manufacturer raise hell update anything changes but , looking pump use making baby food recipe calls tablespoon pumping night infant sleeping thru would not drag electric pump maybe engorged work disappointed 
-1	my 4 month old trouble sleeping my husband i regular bedtime routine , 's breastfed , not fussy waking hours , real active awake , trouble sleeping night she wakes 4 5 times night needing put back after reviewing many sleep soothers hoped would trick play 40 minutes unfortunately up to emphasized after couple weeks trial error i 've learned better set autocry function 10 minutes 40 min funtion works spinning lighting mechanism , not music the sound motor noticeable not loud music stays music stops annoying keeps baby we 've tried replacing batteries multiple times , machine sucks batteries much one needs change night my husband i gone back using glow worm plays music 10 minutes , pretty helpful easier nights as sitting playing aspect , daughter loves grabs one characters motor starts issues this could made better 
-1	i received activity mat gift daughter at first , i liked she loved able bat animals , particularly dragonfly , crinkly stuff inside i think , however , likes activity mats general ! generally , i n't like music n't last long - constantly resetting music/movement turns for baby loves lie thing , means lot resetting i n't really think movement feature adds anything , personally young babies especially trying hard grasp hold animals having move might entertain begin trying grab , actively grabbing , goal grab , explore , grasp , etc the movement thwarts this as daughter gotten older , activity mat less ideal reasons we recently used fisher price rainforest activity mat , dangling toys actually moving pieces ( cylinder filled beads moves makes noise , little propeller thing goes around ) my daughter loved - 4 months , control hands movements moving pieces added another challenge the lamaze mat stuffed toy animals ( one crinkles , one rattle ) i 've thought adding toys bars arch mat fairly low , lamaze toys especially quite long - 'd hitting head i 'm still searching shorter movement oriented toys hang as side note , fisher price mat also great lights flash , option longer consecutive music , mode baby 's movements control music the lamaze mat affected baby 's movement , annoying way - daughter kicks pushes arched bars , music/movement feature , pushing causes movement stop music slow like batteries dying recently , daughter taken wrapping feet around bar lamaze mat actually pushed hard enough cause bars fall mat fold half top i think way bars attached together motor makes move , significantly less stable luckily never hit toppling bars i put daughter mat room i work part-time home - i see easily i feel 's unsafe eyes computer 's mat i watch like hawk one best things activity mat able get couple things done non-sitting infant plays this mat disappoints 
-1	i bought first 4105 model thought i would try model they sized wrong , way big when i contacted la leche league ignored concerns i would not buy -- get model # 4105 , worked great 
-1	i really wanted work - i got tired always undressing using separate pumping bra pumping work i really wanted one product would job the bra pretty tight pumping insert loose could not hold parts pumping i went back wearing bravado nursing tank pump i would unhook sides use simple wishes pumping bra , secure comfortable

-1	i returned started fall apart first wash and thats without use ! i prewashed cover arrived using cart , right wash poly filling coming & seam come apart for price held single wash cycle 
-1	i heard lot folks recommend rocking chairs soothing baby they said helpful sleep holding baby i guess could possibly case chair 6'3 '' n't mind head flopping left right we find chair not sloped back enough ca n't fall asleep holding baby without falling side also , chair 's back high allow neck rest head n't flop side side it 's also expensive we ended soothing baby sleep standing white noise exhaust fan then 's asleep , 'll sit futon prop memory foam pillows around us support arms baby then combined neck rest low back futon fall asleep holding baby even arms became fully relaxed n't worry dropping baby memory foam pillows would hold the baby parents get great rest 
-1	may never issue , chair feels like made balsa wood i really not trust hold time plus hitch bumps rock forward instead gliding i noticed walmart recall version chair posted would worth checking since appears made factory 
-1	if afford buy recliner get recliner skip i not like recliners rocking chairs , newborn would calm rocking , bought one most reviews talked cheaply made squeaky chair n't want invest recliner , purchased i 130lbs , husband closer 200 lbs if weigh much overweight , chair not it slim profile squeaks not good trying put baby sleep also , cushions wear quickly impossible rest chair if wanting something cute nursery n't plan using much , work in end , bought recliner living room we battled colic first months sometimes napping recliner rest could get i also want add i breastfeed , using comfortable chair important 
-1	we 've chair nine months , still rocking that said , 'm not sure much longer actually last one snaps holds upholstery arm chair become unattached ( 'm not completely certain happened since snaps screwed wood ) , chair makes unsettling creaking noise gives impression might fall apart 'm sitting neither husband particularly heavy people , i chock poor quality i absolutely hate fact upholstery not washed my son spit lot due reflux , fluid caught burp cloth/blanket/t-shirt/whatever else could grab , managed find way chair it appalling reviewers say 's good chair price , said price $ 150+ i 'm well aware fact gliders not cheap , 150 dollars steep chair , let alone chair quality i would caution potential buyers remember likely chair going nursery once 're finished using , 're probably going sell throw i would recommend getting quality chair 'll use elsewhere home later date , cheap chair plan throw one 's served 's purpose 
-1	since arrived , chair problem squeaking i read problem another review , since many people rated 4 & 5 stars i went ahead purchased besides squeaking , major issues the hardware ( nuts & bolts ) fall rocking i tightened tight i possibly appropriate tools , husband after 20-30 days fall those parts small enough baby swallow i routinely find floor baby 's room this chair poorly made far squeaking ( loud wakes baby rocking ) , parts falling it i not want pay postage return chair it 's positive points comfortable far padding side pockets nice i 5'10 '' 160lbs , i doubt weight breaking chair making squeak the squeaking temporarily stopped wd-40 , i must apply every 3-4 days otherwise squeak comes back i highly disappointed overall quality chair received

-1	the way pocket hangs , closes , n't catch spills well stick oxo roll travel 
-1	we using baby bjorn bib , sometimes son cried i put bjorn one stiff ( 's used , though ) i wanted try looked like thing , cheaper , less rigid unfortunately , less rigid , pocket n't really open , folds onto food n't caught slides onto lap we n't use anymore maybe 's much older n't need food catcher ( ever happen ? ? ) but , pretty much useless 
-1	these bibs nice idea , bulky , heavy , not easy put , chafe baby 's neck especially if/when pulling 
-1	my eight-month-old sitting eating solids several months , course , makes mess every time , since 's , well , eight months old i got bib , thinking would nice one i could rinse feeding , rather wash bib every meal unfortunately , bibbity *ridiculously* wide , point lot trouble reaching around get food since feed lot finger foods , major deal-breaker he gets frustrated , eventually moves bib around use one arm properly , pocket bottom nearly perpendicular floor shirt going get food the little indents sides arms positioned approximately tops shoulders , even neck bib n't touching neck , not exactly i 'd call `` useful '' i 'm kind astonished 's poor fit ; 's eight months old , wearing 12m clothing ( 29 '' tall 20lbs ) ! there 's way would workable bib newborn ; i think might work 's 18 months , certainly not 
-1	i surprised find disfunctional bib reading reviews purchasing unfortunately son not like wearing , i think irritates neck also , n't seem catch food the front part bib somewhat molded inward ( not sure packaging ) n't catch anything on top , moves forward highchair presses tray really useless we 're going try different kind

-1	this mat rolls really easily , unroll , 's hard get flat suctioned table my son almost two i though would easy restaurants , instead 's awkward also , described , tomato-based products sort stain rubber i would suggest getting going use mostly home not need roll often maintain better flat shape

-1	i rate low come product 's cheap material overall , install went well hold if handy , could easily pick hardware store i would also state painted why would sell beautiful gate ugly connectors

-1	after reading peoples reviews crib i decided go ahead buy anyways in mind way good reviews bad , figured bad reviews people picky things i told i could live scratch 2 problem so received crib opened box first piece 3 scratches 2 dents wood ok i deal then second piece checked bad then 3rd so back amazon went ! btw great customer service problems sending back they even paid return shipping rather return crib get replacement sent , decided go buy buy baby buy one who knows many try 's would taken got crib ok enough i hope graco realizes keeps occurring decides something in end n't waist time energy crib buy something else ! 
-1	i bought crib recommended book baby bargains i thought , `` why buy $ 1000 set nursery furniture 'll use years ? `` my daughter 11 months old , i ordered solid wood crib pottery barn this graco crib flimsy , n't bother could n't pull lay , i hear `` ga-dunk , ga-dunk , ga-dunk '' standing shaking side crib , i get nervous the drop-side recalled requires special kit make fixed in single day , daughter chewed finish one place ; looks like squirrel got it i wish i saved $ 150 ( price time ) bought expensive crib begin it 's not bargain wo n't last children hope 
-1	i disappointed bowl ! all 8 month old push one side pops not mention suction part removable soon un-sticks suction mouth so fun toy play not worth money nice comes lid least 
-1	have n't received order yet luckily i read lot reviews purchasing product description states 2 items mean item 1- bowl , item 2-lid you not get two bowls lids a set equal bowl lid i ordered 2 sets 2 bowls lids twin granddaughters hopes work cause i tired mopping floor picking food bowls meal i feed will add review i get use them update-4/18/11-do n't bother purchase dishes-as reviewers said n't stick well , babies ( 15 months ) rip trays proceed take suction portion also rubber stains red sauces even sweet potato mashies stains n't come dishwasher hand terrible item 
-1	i bought item `` go mama go '' brand i bought main front rail back ordered son trying eat crib lunch they not well padded son hit head still hurt the real dangerous part thing held primarily one long strip standard velcro it goes vertical slats crib velcros gaps slats because not strong enough bond son easily able get hands inside crib slats pull velcro apart slipped rail cover holding onto support gave way smacked head incredibly hard rail crib shame company making piss poor product , leachco lost trust consumer could seriously injured child 
-1	do not fooled selling claiming organic ! it 65 % polyester 35 % cotton , i 'm immediatly sending back full refund lies ! 
-1	great idea the reality fine , would work pinch it need quite bit `` gel-filling '' viable cooling pack not enough gel makes plastic cover hard uncomfortable , get warm quickly also toddler son n't crazy pink bunny ( bunny ears far `` swing-able '' little one ) we would preferred able choose character bears favorite , since photos bears , i thought would get one say `` send send '' i knew risk unfortunately , hard never use , though i keep freezer , case though i 've found , prefers use regular cloth-covered cold pack since 's softer mold-able , lay feels need to when one friends girl , pink bunny definitely going `` donate '' pile 
-1	bought several hopes avoiding plastic , leaked lid also , & # 34 ; plug & # 34 ; made really difficult son get liquid ( tested found tough even ) , take wound back cabinet replaced plastic junk hoping avoid 
-1	i ended returning sippy cup the silicone sleeve torn jagged it very hard super long spout very not user friendly my 6 mo old would n't use 
-1	the straw sucks way air water , meaning baby ends swallowing air bubbles getting frustrated trying get water the sippy mechanism works fine , 's cute also annoying insert special plug seal traveling , otherwise leak top , even clear plastic lid i returned one day 
-1	i bought two i looking leak-proof , non-plastic bottle milk two children first , almost 15 month old hates bottle wo n't drink milk i think 's prefers soft spouts like bottle nipple that disappointing 's supposed better oral development second , milk drips fast spout tipped upside third , replace inner valve keep leaking crazy ! fourth , straw adapter place hole straight top bottom straw n't silicone flap ( not works well anyway ) straw adapter fifth , handles flimsy i prefer cup w/o handles sixth , orange part lid n't separate green part ca n't use spouts so , i 'm still iso non-plastic bottle milk kiddos i 'm thinking trying nuby silicone spout kleen kanteen i read fit i know nuby 's pretty tough silicone 
-1	this sippy cup close perfect my son 1 really likes straw cups we live phoenix really need insulated cup outings finding good insulated straw cup proven impossible this cup lot great features : removable handles , cover , stainless steel rubber sleeve make awesome little hands keeping beverages cold however one huge downfall the valve use straw attachment not leak proof the straw valve completely open serves attach straw top cup if cup gets tossed , like frequently , straw leak lots fluid this cup would perfect straw able attach sippy valve ( leak proof , unless shaken upside ) and open straw valve it would perfect cup ages leak proof sippy fluid restriction younger kids ( kid like mine , gets much mouth , like cup straw valve , anything extra gets spit which equals spit milk place ) for older kids wide open straw valve perfect - wide open straw cup fluid restrictions know not throw cup : ) i really really hope make spill proof valve straw regardless son totally loves cup - even sippy mode since 're not point using straw without leaking like crazy update : at first i thought sippy valve leak proof wrong we used stroller day n't upright entire time - spent time side - ended wet pants wet stroller so disappointed ! it seems cup 's side tiny movement case drops liquid come a drops i would n't problem but leaked bad stroller totally wet sons pants soaked at point i 'm going stick playtex insulated straw cups while plastic n't keep beverages cold n't leak us ever i 'd rather bring little cooler pack deal milk son , car , stroller , etc 
-1	i love concept stainless steel cup i trying get away plastic , unfortunately i n't really like execution it holds quite bit liquid , unlike sippy cups , struggle getting liquid i use straw insert one year old sipping straws since 9 months , used at first i found odd cheeks would sink sipping , i n't think much then husband told try drink cup it near impossible ! i feel bad given son you exert way much effort little liquid get my husband commented found water metallic taste , though i n't notice strange taste however , i stopped using son he sometimes like drink quite bit water , i n't want breaking sweat trying relieve thirst ! too bad , really looks good release valve would near perfect i never used anything straw attachment i n't know works regular sippy travel sippy i still n't found sippy cup n't leak i always make sure keep sippys i carry upright position so far best i 've found innobaby 3-in-1 stainless sippy , even one leaves quite bit desired 
-1	not sure , called safe sippy using straw-cup leaks everywhere horrible have not tried sippy-option not using anymore , mess , 14 month drops floor waste money neat idea , poor execution 
-1	i washed first time i used , not even 5 mins putting , i leaked one i use washable pads problem in case get pay 
-1	n't work well , hard get two pieces attach thought might easier clean little mesh baggie types , n't son manages get two pieces detached quite easily save money , get mesh baggie types munchkin makes harder clean , n't detach 
-1	i really wanted like the mesh feeders pain clean i hoped would answer it easier clean , son ( 6 months ) doesnt seem get much mesh ones also , stem way long gags not thrilled 
-1	i ordered time kidsme feeder never ended using it 's awkwardly made way big teething baby 5 months i ordered 9 months still would not use you not easily stick food anything stick goes middle maybe i 'm something wrong i ca n't figure thing would good as others said n't fit much food either 
-1	we bought item alternative another silicone feeder really liked however silicone feeder n't big enough growing boys we like one bigger held fruit the bad part , feeder method locking handle silicone it plastic ring clicks everything together , within seconds using first time ( time 11 month old ) sons able take apart mashed banana everywhere in addition feeders infants/toddler opening tether lanyard feeder held/attached place as soon sons done feeders thrown dropped using stroller means feeders generally after times happened lost feeders finally started looking every 5 minutes make sure boys still them overall i disappointed products use , size good 
-1	save money , not buy ! washed not washed , turns small buckles mattress weird since 's made graco i graco pack n ' play ? 
-1	plastic toys hard-plastic , not kind give unfortunately return , 's good value money looking additional colorful toys baby 
-1	i bought i read book great bath time i went use , temperature indicator always looked it looks though always says `` hot '' even 's not water so i 've resorted using expensive bath toy 
-1	this thermometer never worked us , tried everything ! the strip must dud buyer beware this disappointing us 
-1	i listened reviews ! very angry ! the leak bottom so dissapointed ! do not buy ! 
-1	these bottles truly nothing special i ca n't believe insanely expensive ! they n't decrease amount air daughter swallowed , visibly see bubbles entering milk is n't whole point ? to reduce air intake ? they 're definitely not first bottles i reach , i use pinch overall , i would not recommend 
-1	i used bottles loved first child formula fed since , design changed ( added ring ) well materials used everything i loved first i still love the problem nipples my second exclusively breastfed flow fast we still using newborn nipples ( baby 4 months old ) drowns hes used super slow flow eating breast doesnt cut he ends eating fast throws good ounce precious milk , hungry 30 minutes needless say , i search new bottle 
-1	these really dont anything special the avent bottles great way waste money shame philips guilting people buying avent products there many many many products thing 1/5 price every time i see i think other things i could bought ! every time i write review anything avent bottles i think much money i wasted update : also rings leak 
-1	we used bottles since son born- first tiny four ounce ones big nine ounce ones our son likes 're wide enough hold onto i n't notice miracle cure fussing less gas anything like what i notice gasket goes inside ring screws onto bottle melts microwave sterilizer they got little bumpy still usable until one super late night feeding husband baby got soaked gasket apparently could n't work anymore we still almost dozen bottles 're not cheap threw gasket used bottles parts tonight ran bottles microwave sterilizer , two rings melted fused together why would company make baby bottle certain parts withstand sterilizing ? i plan contact company complain , course make difficult accept phone calls , not email complaints 
-1	these bottles worthless they leak we many bottles ( maybe 15 20 ) , leak others the yellow tinted bottles not leak , ones blue o-rings leak pretty regularly we 've tried everything think , including getting parts wet put together they still leak and n't leak every time , i often let guard assume wo n't leak , i pour milk son it 's bad enough expensive formula , i spill breast milk , 's awful ! i dissatisfied i 'm buy whole new set bottles ( another brand ) baby i 'm pregnant , even though i 've invested probably $ 100 avent bottles 
-1	i really tried use bottles n't make daughter happy she really fussy gas bottles n't help i used mix formula i put formula dr brown bottles she stopped gas issues brown bottles 
-1	i tried bottles first son came home hospital got terrible gas furthermore , i could n't understand see supposed reduce gas , spitting , colic the bottles use , playtex drop-ins vent aire anti-gas mechanisms actually see working i used one avent bottles 3 pack donated two charity for baby , brand not effective i would encourage anyone using bottle still gas colic issues try playtex drop-in 's if ca n't see bottle reducing gas intake , probably n't , least n't effectively that , least , experience 
-1	we use avent bottles invested many nipples accessories harder plastic bottles we liked brand even though always small leaks bottles open close couple times get good grip we purchased 6 amazon thinking clear hard plastic instead received set soft white color plastic bottles , leak by leak i n't mean small leaks/drips like , i mean hold bottle sideways entire thing empty minute they 're unusable the bottles n't come adaptor , i 'm amazed avent amazon would sell junk like this do n't waste money buy 
-1	this mat cheaply poorly made - also much smaller similar mats we purchased baby started rolling around 3-4 months mat would not stay together pieces would break apart hardly movement we returned got awesome mat love costco ! 
-1	very small ! our baby ended not using the seams weird angles fit strange shoulder made small babies arms long 's awkward fit 
-1	these plates nice looking using couple months impossible clean neither hand wash ( i e scrubbing ) dishwasher i used basic toddler foods like mashed potatoes , quiche , pasta food residue would n't come plates 
-1	i bought recommendation friend i 'm not sure made , i find incredibly messy not worth effort works okay small , fairly dry meals ( like spaghetti ) forget trying bulk meals anything slightly liquidy bulk meals ( like ice cube tray worth peas ) makes hand hurt refill n't hold much liquidy foods squirt bottom leak counter plus grinder part made poorly n't fit well grooves hard get undone i 'm finished using it the good part 's totally dishwasher safe wash well and 's cheap 
-1	i honestly n't understand reviews indicating `` easy use '' it 's easy enough fill wash ( dishwasher safe ) , getting cubes freezing nearly impossible in addition running hot water ( long time ) , i use knife pry 's struggle it help underfill slightly freezing , cubes n't overflow touch top i think problem stems fact outside edges get hot water inner cubes mostly untouched , want stay put thebeaba multiportion freezer tray - greenis much easier use , though not direct comparison 's expensive makes fewer cubes larger size but i got beaba , green sprouts tray n't used 
-1	i purchased tray advised friend needed freezer containers ones purchased baby brezza prima ( baby brezza trays spacious small freezer ) we used two weeks pleased silicone broke one side ! now i 3 cubes i not use we decided purchase mumi & bibi starter trays rather replace one more expensive , yes , worth it- take little space cubes come push finger ! we contacted friend trays said used kids , maybe got faulty one 
-1	pros : -easy pour spread puree cubes-freezes quickly-gives perfect 1 oz cubes-silicone lot give flexiblecons : -major pain pop cubes without getting fingers them-definitely holds smell our first puree made apples , i washed soap & hot water i could still smell applesafter trying reinvent wheel , i 've realized ice cube trays work best us making purees they easiest pop cubes right ziplock go freezer these trays purchased baby shower well freeze store containers tailored baby really ca n't beat tray costs $ 1 target terms performance i still use tray i 'm making big batches , takes effort pop cubes get bag without getting hands rather sticky what i think would help would make sides solid texture bottoms flex silicone it 's hard not tray flop around hands 're popping food overall , decent product worth try money , trying frugal , go good ol ' ice cube trays ! 
-1	i use baby food i thought silicone would make easy pop cubes , cubes right next whole tray like rock you ca n't get food unless thaw little first i tried peeling back silicone actually put little hole it would work better little space cube like normal ice cube tray 
-1	i tried threading number different brands bottled water the threads engaged , would n't fully seat the top would n't seal easily popped off not worth trying return price 
-1	my 11 month old pulled dish tray within seconds putting i bought i loved fact divided plate suction i went babiesrus bought tommee tippee 's suction plate works wonderful save money one get tommee tippee 's also dishes work suction mat great product ! ! 
-1	we returned product i n't like fact could never really get water led believe time , mold would grow inside also , plate part suction base not one piece child able easily pull remove highchair tray spill contents floor not good book : - ( 
-1	my baby reflux spits lot these not waterproof ! everything leaks ! i would not recommend ! 
-1	i 've used loved , i ordered the first pack i purchased buybuy baby i n't issues except lost vacation i washed pack using seam top around front neck yellow one tore unfortunately , disappointing 
-1	this horrible waste money the top part big , stuffed foam make comfortable ripped bib within two washes stick wtih mum mum big instead -- expensive work better last many , many washes 
-1	my son acid reflux throwing constantly i bought thinking would work great catching milk ( ) part around neck rolled , caused rashes around son 's neck chin i 'm assuming wet rolled area constantly rubbing skin 
-1	how impractical ca n't put bibs dryer , line-dried ours iron-on image front actually melt stick together wad 
-1	the velcro sharp cut son 's legs i would not recommend diaper cover we used organic wool covers loved ! 
-1	i n't even understand cloth diapering companies sell anything velcro i love covers , velcro n't last i think 's really nature velcro n't reusable covers so sure invest wisely get kind snaps i know i 'll never buy covers velcro deteriorated otherwise , great product ! 
-1	i disappointed diaper at beginning worked great i liked diaper covers snaps i used prefold diapers i leaks however , month use velcro not hold anymore , cover useless it waste money ! 
-1	do n't like it cute cute i excited get but six months use ( expecting six months still ) , i 've enough we use like diaper covers brand one weak velcro came but aside , also sags we tried everything keep sagging know thing completely baby mind , brand diaper covers function fine we ca n't figure problem , i , seamstress , think elastic going around outside we still use baby absolutely must wear pair pants which sad 's cute wish i 'd spent money something functional though 
-1	after one two uses one male snaps front diaper used size stopped snapping cover sized largest setting medium sized baby i 'm disappointed i keep hearing great wraps it 's second last wrap i go stash , ultimately means i never use hopefully i 'll able get use baby large size , 's total bust boo ! 
-1	the baby kicks joey bunz premium inserts much better thirsties hemp inserts : joey bunz dry half time , 're contoured , 're softer , 're organic i either put thirsties drier twice hand dry hour drier i n't recommend thirsties 
-1	these inserts disappointing they take forever dry , leak right ! ! worst inserts i tried i recommend flip inserts , much absorbent dry faster these inserts also stain inserts , n't contain newborn pee poop , take long time dry ( longer inserts i tried ) the flip inserts soak pee wick away daughter 's skin these thirsties inserts soak sit wet 
-1	i initially bought go thristies pull pocket diapers daughter year 1/2 complete potty trained success suddenly began wetting bed night sometimes multiple times absolutely refused incur expense disposable pull ups sought cloth alternative to get point would not stay put pocket wide stiff contour odd put wear , needless say daughter wouldnt wear even insert rode onside diaper still wet everything i kept anyway shortly found expecting soon ds large enough use tried arent asorbent hoped doubler add so muchg bulk not soft well arent go time use lay ( like u would perfold ) home cruise diaper it ben dificult get stains well immediate treater ie : spray treat stain remover mixture give brush small circular motion spray wash within 48 hours they arent great gues u get pay 
-1	we actually tested vs joey 's hemp inserts these ones absorbed 3 oz water , regular joey 's ( single insert ) absorbed ~5 oz water ( almost 6 oz ) , joey 's premium ( thin double insert ) absorbed nearly 9 ( ! ! ) oz water they 're nearly price size , i would n't recommend i 've told organic cotton ( 're cotton+hemp mix ) absorbent regular cotton , i believe ! : ) 
-1	we used prefolds thirsties covers least 12 months i still n't ever use although i bought bunch we 've never leak blow yet 
-1	our graco stroller regular stroller , nothing fancy this netting nowhere even close big enough fit 
-1	these n't really need purchased go 6x6 mat if order , sure get enough pieces go around whole mat also , 11 month old found corner part today began chew it comes easily swallowed if playard mat not notice mat come apart yet i probably would not purchase edges corners playmat the playmat looks great without 
-1	we purchased product setup play area 6 month old crawling it arrived quickly looked like pictured individual mats not solid they like jigsaw puzzles the letters numbers come mat we felt uncomfortable size pieces due baby like everyone else 's i sure putting everything mouth having add edges mat ; need purchase separately ; adds issue the mats looked nice n't come apart would kept nothing description indicates pieces the packaging warning : choking hazard - small parts not children 3 years this also not mentioned description if description i would not purchased item 
-1	there really good making cubes the coverage area tiny played child 4 months 
-1	until son decided fun thing rip right table would great child n't prone grabbing hold everything sight 
-1	we used one toppers metal outdoor table restaurant i could n't get adhesive table finished i felt bad i created extra work staff 
-1	i heard great things woombie excited use neck way small chokes baby ! i would buy instant larger neck hole my baby 14 lbs neck n't oversized waaaay small this supposed fit babies 14-19 lbs bummer ! 
-1	i 'm not sure one got even grip , let alone colors from reviews , sounds like may may not get see for us , one unlucky ones the set works fine , imho probably n't worth $ 5+ considering quality 
-1	if order , get something different it plain white brush comb , gripping looks like toy doll 's set do not order , not replace pictured , amazon gives refund like , i wanted pictured i not getting not even order 
-1	trust , i 'm hairstylist the comb 's edge sharp scratched baby 's scalp i meant not part comb , whole edge comb sharp brush hard use might feel soft touch baby soft scalp , could easily rub hard i wish i never used baby major skin problem scalp using this just trust , please n't buy , i regret much buying 
-1	i suspected would big needs however , 're looking something really large store lot toys , would great i n't think would look good , though , huge hammock hanging ceiling/wall 
-1	dont waste money , ikea makes straps work much better used everythingthese come easy 
-1	the sticky pads hold base onto side dresser n't stay sticky long , son able pull 
-1	very unhappy quality product within one week adhesive already starting stopped sticking now 3 weeks , four come completely waste of money ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
-1	we ultimately used n't stay stuck 's daughter n't really care particular drawers n't already ripped 
-1	i ordered phantom color shipped total black i still n't heard back company yet regarding fixing mistake plus , read reviews company ( i done prior purchasing ) , get awful reviews across board 
-1	i wanted blue sent pink i lazy send back i gave someone else 
-1	it takes almost hour get 1/4 oz baby - barely feel pumping even high i n't get great reviews ( i bought based - really chaps behind ) just reference - i tons milk ( comes 's lightly stimulated ) i actually manually express breast milk faster easier - ridiculous although way lot work - got ta got ta product purchased job seemingly won't i 'm buy hospital grade another - n't decided yet 
-1	i product baby registry disappointed see price inflated $ 10 overnight i hope n't happen ! one reason i chose brand/model price ! 
-1	i bought hamper son 's nursery disappointed arrived it incredibly flimsy if i threw laundry would loose form lid would cave i also thought pretty pricey i got it ended getting returned 
-1	i wanted something neutral this hamper looks okay , 's kind cheap looking cheaply made it 's basically cardboard covered fabric it 's flimsy once put something , loses shape the lid not lie top opening perfectly , gaps around edges , lid also mostly sinks hamper instead resting top opening i returning item 
-1	i bought back june i 6 months pregnant , i expected fit carseat since nothing amazon jj cole website saying exluded baby seat types well doesnt fit car seat way late return i guess i get assuming product would fit i chicco key fit seat it terrible also zippers not go i take it took 5 people try get go back i not recommend jj cole anyone so im stuck terrible product 
-1	i bought 4 pack local store they good ergonomically good use however , 2 meals , got stained badly carrots it n't wash i 'm going get set silicon spoons instead 
-1	i chose pack bibs bc boyish modern print i unable find elsewhere when i recieved , completely unlike ( print-wise ) picture not modern i could probably found something similar walmart : -p bummer when i called returning , i would take ups , recieved refund re-order hopes recieving proper item no thanks , i live 30 miles nearest ups they 're bibs i guess , i really hoping something bit different 
-1	i excited set breakfast bar let baby `` hang '' enjoy meal time right next us the chair gorgeous construction clearly top-notch unfortunately , hooks go table way long , not come close fitting short overhang i going try inglesina , hopefully work , i 'm sad n't rotate like chair 
-1	as mom twins small house , i really wanted like chair hook one i could find rotated decent food tray also five star reviews convinced perfect choice however , chicco really missed mark ! the fabric canvas material soaks liquids impossible clean properly even i try use spray cleaner , cleaner soaks seat normally i would buy extra seat cover switch every day , cover cumbersome remove it easier remove entire seat table , hose scrub outside let dry sun this much work every day also food gets stuck many tiny crevices seat , even material better would almost impossible clean properly it not hygeinic i ended returning joovy hooks , leatherette material 
-1	i plan contacting chicco asap we recieved cool , useful , handy rotating hook chair friday quicklu tested safety ease use at first time use , appeared exactly said would said would however , later night restaurant , i tried dismantling trouble my husband stepped issue disconnecting mount chair place travel bag would not budge my husband ended getting severly pinched finally got parts loose eachother it almost ripped skin he bad bruise finger we thought maybe 's new parts stuck together badly causes injury get loose could real product liability issue we used saturday night thing , parts would not disconnect anything , dad gave go also severely pinched too- also blood bruise finger trying loosen disconnect parts i love chair not love dismantling travel be careful ! i hate give two stars i also n't want anyone getting hurt trying disconnect either 
-1	these bottles would okay , n't leak i like wide mouth mixing formula wider nipple unfortunately , thin tubing vent system does get tad bit annoying clean , particularly i 've found born free bottles work better , ( although still annoying tube clean ) plus option getting wide , glass bottles my ultimate gripe leak no matter i much/little formula i put bottle , develop strange , illogical little leaks i feed son 30 minutes problems , set bottle , pick , big trail milk run sides , hand , table/floor , son i always careful handling , i afraid jiggling causing leak , made difference wiping leak , established , useless , mysterious leak continues dribble rest feeding , i pour contents another , dry bottle finish feeding particularly fun , screamer also worth noting , `` not fill '' line bottles , particularly smaller ones , half way bottle ! that 's plain silly and 4 oz line , means addition formula powder put over `` not fill '' line i n't problem 5 oz born free bottles give son less burping spit-ups anyway a positives noting i love solid mixing tops come , i still use born free bottles also , born free nipples flimsy difficult son latch , even level 1 nipples still drown , use dr brown ( level 2-3 ) nipples born free bottles instead you purchase mixing lids nipples separately , 's need invest whole system update : i pulled one use today i `` deep-clean '' born free bottles it perfectly dry , filled well fill line , n't jiggled turned upside within minutes , leaked table , son , sofa , floor i tossed rest garbage 
-1	i purchased along several types sippy cups friend told would take find one would like the name little misleading i thought `` soft '' meant spout would squishy like bottle , 's really quite rigid i reserve complete judgement cups i figure i 'll give another go 's little older , definitely not good cup start if 're looking good first sippy , son really likes nuk learner cup silicone spout we used nuk bottles almost seamless transition infact use bottle add handles differnt shaped nipple highly recommend ! 
-1	the colors puzzle stacker muted my son not drawn not pictured ! 
-1	the idea mamaroo great i looking forward using product however , many design flaws overall i feel product not worth cost i would not buy i 2011 model here major flaws opinion:1 ) the seat not really recline the seat basically goes `` sitting way '' `` sitting slightly '' i wish seat actually reclined the company states mamaroo reclines along axis reality seat belt harness attached axis fixed position limits seat tilted i found even `` reclined '' position , 4 month old baby still falling mamaroo ends basically supported crotch harness since upright 2 ) the safety crotch harness many flaws first , i n't understand 5-point system shoulder harness not included instead , mamaroo comes 3 point crotch harness as i mentioned , baby ends putting lot weight harness since seat not really recline the harness hard plastic buckle inserts facing baby not parent ! i find ridiculous i struggle snap unsnap harness reaching around inner part harness i not even see buckle the hard plastic harness buckles press baby the plastic buckles face towards parent use , not way around this design makes sense since seat n't really recline since means baby puts lot weight harness sitting upright , makes hard buckles inside even worse baby i n't think safety harness comfortable baby , easy use parent , even secure ( due lack shoulder harness ) 3 ) the mamaroo not come actual music you use music via ipod -- fine someone extra ipod hook mamaroo not good n't ipod extra ipod the nature sounds built mamaroo fine unfortunately ca n't scroll electronic display instead , flick circular switch go nature sounds find one want i find irritate wake baby i would prefer see sounds listed display order choose sound i want quickly 4 ) the motions mamaroo makes fine they not soothe baby , however my baby seemed find motions pleasant amusing not help baby sleep other `` regular '' swings worked much better helping baby fall asleep 5 ) although baby still 25 pound weight limit mamaroo , i already find mamaroo seat small in addition , seat made material causes baby sweat i usually place cotton cloth behind baby 's head mamaroo , otherwise back head get sweaty i wish mamaroo came better fabric comfortable baby 6 ) the mobile balls hang baby tend fall constantly end floor they also not interesting baby overall , i shocked find many flaws expensive product especially one supposedly designed `` moms '' 
-1	i wish fabric soft hard rough feel , i inserted super soft kiddopotamus insert son likes seat much better now very disappointed top speed slow my son isnt super slow speeds seat the toy bar hangs way low , 5 inches sons face , dont use all im upset i spent much money something hard , moves slow & toys close face usefyi speed : my son 9 lbs 8 oz birth currently 14 lbs 4 oz 8 weeks old always moved slow 
-1	i excited store what could better mirroring mother 's movement right ? ? wrong my baby never stayed minutes crying i think found seat uncomfortable matter adjusted best guess made nauseated well for whatever reason , mamaroo actually made upset also , unlike swings , movement way slow grab attention i traded chic useless thing classic boring fisher price swing sometimes things classic reason the fisher price may ugly , baby loves skip mamaroo 
-1	it okay install however not work comforting baby baby cried lot returned bought baby simple swing baby happy eventually went sleep 
-1	all need original nas frida , extra money not needed spend i wish i n't purchase i however think nasfrida product lifesaver order expectant friends

-1	i washed blanket using after washing not soft pretty blanket i bought it & # 34 ; lint grabber & # 34 ; brown hem i would not buy 
-1	product description says fit windows 40 & # 34 ; , not our windows 39 & # 34 ; ( windows , not including molding ) , small screws also horrible - not take standard sized screwdriver super annoying ! about hour wasted fiddling thing coming impass also , quality construction appears poor 
-1	i received premium newborn nutrition kit sample son 's dr 's office came powder formula , read-to-use bottles , collar & nipples , among items when i tried ready-to-use 2oz bottles collar & nipple came package , collar n't tighten well ( n't tighten ) bottle when , seems 's pressure bottle collar & nipple pop right i start feeding liquid spills i ended put `` ready-to-use '' liquid regular bottle the concept seems convenient on-the-go collar seems attach well it these blue collars standard flow , btw would come newborn sample anyway ? !

-1	we loved monkey , despite loud ticking sound makes , winter came along now stays dark late , daughter ca n't see whether monkey 's eyes opened closed ( little night light stays 30 seconds pushing button , let get close enough push button , 'll go ahead push button opens eyes well ) as result , wakes 4 a m , and either turns on the light room order see whether eyes open comes out to wake us up and ask whether his eyes are open i 'm trying different model suggest 
-1	drawers flimsy

-1	this wetbag not contain moisture countless times i placed used cloth diaper , contents diaper bag dampened end day i got replace another bag 's broken zipper , price i figured could n't hurt try it works pinch , i 'd recommend placing inside plastic bag away things wick moisture ( really defeats whole purpose reusable wet bag ) i use toys if looking use hold wet soiled cloth diapers , i recommend spending little something else 
-1	after using plate toddler 3 months lightly microwaving food , plastic bubbled time it point small pieces plastic sticking food we threw last night ( 3 month plate ) 
-1	think fell car almost got accident n't stay well n't safe would not recommend stay away 
-1	these flow way fast our breastfed infant choking milk coming fast on one occasion i left bottles sitter , i came home find husband attempting feed baby letting milk drip one nipples another nipple slow for looking alternative , ended using avent bottles they great - flow right little girl n't get much gas

-1	i might well give almost-two-year-old open topped cup drink we kind munchkin cup flip top lid that kind much better we bought teething daughter chewed straws kind they keep milk cold fine except constant leaking spewing top i constantly loosen lid milk slide back straw we leather seats car milk splatters e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e if 're looking cup , munchkin cups w/ flip straws better on better side , shipping amazon , usual , fantastic ! 
-1	i really thought clever cup months figured weaknesses mostly thanks little guy he problem drinking , i got fed mess ! - if liquid inside cold warms , push way straw- if toddler pinches straw , drink streams out- if toddler throws cup , straw inevitably gets hit leaves quite spray pattern way/floor- on side , liquid works way out- if toddler pushes top , sink allow drink pour way- if toddler hits straw top , 's spray- there always little liquid seal child drinks -- drops fall tipped

-1	i really wanted love bibs ! they cute n't completely hide outfits have keep drooling the downside placement snaps they tight already 's 4 5 months old 's using snaps furtherest apart my daughter n't huge neck either : ) 
-1	i original diaper champ first child , boy i wish i could find one ! in opinon , one instances original far superior 'new improved ' version pros - 's still nice able use regular trash bag instead buy specialized bag cons - whew ! it 's longer odor-free ! yes , diapers go channel lid top helps , created new design lost 'lock ' old version prevented odors coming back channel this one also not hold many diapers old version this one supposed hold 30 diapers , 30 stretch although odor issue , 's best change bags 2-3 times week , limit diapers n't bad thing bottom line - find original version , get it ! ! it worked flawlessly two years , odor , mess , easy use if find 'deluxe ' try different brand 
-1	what genius decided make thing short ? ! a lady delivered baby n't need added back ache bend nearly ground throw away diaper not , handle sticks ( pops side ) regular basis also , open chute dispose diaper , get giant nose full everything 's bin in words , awful stink bin scooped disposal chamber wafts room every time throw diaper away this definitely not odor proof the old model taller n't hurt backs the old model not stink every time threw away diaper why in the world did they change the design ? ! 
-1	this thing pointless you smell dirty diapers lid we previously using open garbage bin individual plastic bags smelly poops i guess seal diaper champ n't effective also , last night i opened lid first time omg- i think i burned nose hairs scalded back throat horrible , horrible , pungent stankvapors rose bin beware ! ! ! ! ! ! this thing trap enough air in bin ferment dirty diapers horrible smell , creating highly potent uber-stank i appreciate companies try create nifty gadgets make parents ' lives easier pleasant people need go back drawing board 
-1	we loved diaper champ deluxe 9 months old then noticed undescribable smell nursery low behold diaper champ : ( so cleaning soaking everything vinegar baking soda bleach , nothing defeated grossness we followed every instruction nothing come find , plastic seal lid diaper champ causing odor you ca n't clean ? ? ? ? ( i tried ) which makes sense anyway , contacted babytrend , makers diaper champ get replacement seal they back-order ? ? ? so took information going ship almost $ 10 00 plus s & h came over month later , seal i n't understand company makes item claim back-order month according representative baby trend , `` n't supply replacement parts , extra service provide customers '' she proceeded agree i said i guess i trash useless diaper champ look something else since could not give idea replacement seal would available seriously ! so needless say , hunt new diaper pail sorry , need waste money pail does't even last year a trash lid nursery would served us well 
-1	i purchased product sister used older version happy purchase the new model however n't contain odor its capacity also less the lid refuses open half days diapers we open push diapers least fit days worth not happy customer : ( 
-1	i wanted good toy , sound stopped working four days purchased if wet suction cup , sticks pretty well others mentioned my daughter liked made sound wo n't bother 
-1	ugh ! i bought toy two reasons 1 , attach dd 's high chair could play something could n't throw floor ( fun phase ) i washed dishes cooked meals 2 , attach exersaucer , given us hand-me-down missing toy two i found buy , buy , baby $ 7 99 bought it sticker saying award winning toy year something along lines i honestly idea would give toy award basically spin make noise the noises loud not turned turned its probably really interesting little baby fascinated able make object spin gently brushing hand , age group packaging ( i think said 6-12 months ) not interesting once daughter figured make work , it the toy not stay base it easily knocked baby 's arm , strong breeze , looking wrong way i suppose could use advantage want use ring fasten play gym stroller ? but point suction cup ? the suction cup joke it sticks really slick surfaces , n't stay put well it refused attach exersaucer , partly i bought for i think toy saw less 2 weeks use house 
-1	we bought toy 8 month old son first air plane ride kept hidden plane we got ready however , taking package pulling tabby thing keepts making noise -- kept hidden diaper bag plane well diaper bag wouldnt stop going i mean barely bump bag hear music coming inside ! after trip i keep toy car even house , goes time a soft breeze makes thing start ! even car i want throw window it alllllways going even i position not moving eventually tried ripping cardboard fit slot tabby thing originally make stop , did work its not good idea forever wants play i dont want pulling cardboard putting mouth its ok `` car toy '' i 've leaving sun back window hopefully make hot batteries burn lol no idea would make toy switch turn music the music and toy actually really cute like baby/kids toy gets terriably annoying long oh well , lesson learned next time ! check switches ! 
-1	this toy good concept it suction cup base toy spins plays music i bought trip via airplane worked well flight but loaded rental car thing played music every time hit bump turned corner it extremely sensitive i eventually gave away driving nuts if handle constant music , & # 8217 ; good toy i got sick 
-1	we bought son right started sitting table ( 6 months ) , hoping fun entertaining toy go eat i known better , son tires toys quickly he 's gregarious prefers interaction people toys day ! that said , niece , 12 days younger , loves toy , ca n't keep eyes hands , lol , got lot use visiting i think sister-in-law ran right bought one left ! so , toy appeal babies not much others , 'll gauge baby likes i thought 'd give shot , since sitting table new experience him as previous reviewer mentioned , music thing annoying , on/off switch volume control ( major design flaw ) i foresight hold onto tab inserts slot keep music playing packaging we replace tab every time put toy away i 'm pretty sure 're going lose soon , though , since son figured remove second time played he also enjoys chewing/teething suction cup , toy easily comes away suction cup , making far easy baby catch eye toss toy part shoulder , lol `` meh , i 'm done '' 
-1	does not perform function the suction cup not work even son 6 months strong enough detach spinner part throw ground defeating purpose toy could attach high chair table when leaves alone entertained moving parts mirror i would n't buy 
-1	it seemed like good idea , soon realized photos stick clear plastic inside pockets appear hazy you detach time get clear view pics in terms baby proofing job , holds pictures we ended tossing one buying expensive usable album 
-1	babies want bite chew 's makes dangerous not leave baby unattended book warning sign ! 
-1	baby fingers stick ball frame : ( ( watch i not know crying fingers got caught 
-1	the item get not pictured the two sides actually sewn togethere really ca n't stand mirror prop something it made cheap material , like ugly nylon the mirror hideous not worth $ 10 
-1	it n't stand it 's ok daughter likes playing sux lays flat not worth $ 16 i paid 
-1	if thing sat two seconds would wonderful the velcro n't hold closed tight enough hang pack play either 
-1	i bought mirror baby would able see laying back , slants open mirror prop see 's past head so , i tried hook toy arch play mat , includes two velcro loops bottom , slants away why n't four loops even three , least one top middle beyond also , mirror like fun house mirror , weird since packaging states accurate reflection one features 
-1	this mirror great theory not practice the a shape mirror opens not stay , ends folding flat when 's flat , 's wrong angle baby look see 
-1	while might great toy young baby n't move around much , not working great busy 5 month old it light tries play toys pulls , tips the front back not separate appear product photo , rather joined material open far , n't always want stay open sit floor i tried crib , velcro straps hold short fit back rail crib , seemed big bulky front i trying reach baby 
-1	my 4-month old seems enjoy stomping toy , i think 's nice features various textures qualities sound however , i agree reviewers extremely irritating songs repeat without stopping even baby stopped hitting toy ; though , i find setting song would fade 20 seconds -- wish i could figure find setting again however , main peeve difficult clean the instructions say wipe damp cloth fabric gets stains absorbs grossness , big problem you 'd take entire back plate disassemble toy completely in order take back , non-standard ( triangle ) screwdriver , i n't able yet if i could get back i assume i could potentially wash fabric part without messing electronic part because 's basically un-washable , i would not recommend toy i let baby step , never grab , 's starting get feet toward mouth , i 'll stop even i 'm glad i n't pay much -- i bought secondhand ( another reason irks ca n't washed ) oh , i agree easy way attach crib stroller -- i rig elaborate system loops pulleys get stay footrest bouncer 
-1	ok designed piece junk ? first dangling fish like photo , lights like description states it hard plastic thing fabric fish it not hooked crib baby play floor when press fish 3 options classical music- plays one song , tactile tune- one sound fish , silly sound- yes one sound the textures stupid the one worth anything furry fish the others n't `` overdone '' enough baby get satisfaction touching there tiny crinkly fin , bumpy fabric , felt fin , rubber fish it big bulky baby pick , fish hard babies push my daughter 8 months well recommended age- able push do n't waste your money get something baby pick feel , transfer hand hand , chew etc 
-1	adverise saying first sounds though electronic device makes sounds but unfortunately sounds written dont match well 
-1	i bought 7 month old terrible , potentially harmful toy she teething immediately drawn colorful books , grabbing , opening , , course , putting mouth i shocked find colors ran the product says paint free , definitely kind paint books , dissolves baby 's mouth i not know made , i n't take risks baby 's health immediately took toy away her in addition hazard , toy not good introducing sounds it ma-ma , da-da , ba-ba listed m , d , b sounds then picture monkey , dog , sheep overall , poorly designed , potentially dangerous baby toy 
-1	my son n't find particularly interesting , block mostly unplayed with he 's nine months old still finds little entertainment 
-1	to short baby play , difficult get make noise not good buy us 
-1	my brother gave son born back 2010 the good news ? it 's still going strong three years two babies the bad news ? by & # 34 ; going strong , & # 34 ; i mean randomly triggering astonishing frequency we packed box hall closet the music would go front door opened we moved attic , would hear echoes music windy nights if falls floor , chime someone walks across room so , bottom line : - loud music may disturb child- music triggers slightest movement- suction cup not stay affixed surface- toy not stay secure suction cup base- brother might amused stories become mission find ever-louder , annoying toys nephew ( see also : fisher price bubble mower , b whee-mote rc car ) 
-1	let start saying son really likes playing it engaging , fun toy i little frustrated though i bought i wanted suction toy would stick place i would n't constantly picking toys putting back high chair tray but n't stick well there times i 've stuck toy high chair loses suction falls without even touched *grumble* imagine easy baby grab pull right tray only drop/throw floor soon , defeating purpose toy so yes-it cute fun baby play however , i known going end another noise making toy moving parts , i would n't bothered buying 
-1	yes , i hate the suction cup n't stick the toy n't stay base the ( loud ) music plays slightest vibration but children love/loved i got rid suction cup base try move carefully around toy 's put away i 'll get rid soon forget 's there bottom line : run run far away note : apparently , 's new version toy mine two years old i obviously old one the new one might much better , though incessant music one things kids love , toy without music not really toy anymore 
-1	this thing not stick , anywhere which needed , distraction changing , n't us good 
-1	my lo likes but suction cup n't really work and couple washings clear plastic fogging not mention 's not water proof water gets stuck inside just not i expecting 
-1	this never stayed stuck tray , even quite small n't take much effort break suction 
-1	the '' music '' annoying the suction cups works poorly toy bulky what 's , music not play long time 
-1	this toy sticks highchair table great spins also great this toy awful music you n't need anywhere near set either it particularly fond going trying get pair twins sleeping chest crib please heed warning- toys much household friendly 
-1	these little guys seem cool get they not squeek crinkle good the string hang seems like might come apart babies mouth overall seem kind flimsy would not recommend 
-1	i bought toy 1 year old she loves toys spin this toy hold suction minute playing and n't hold much longer not played i tried stick high chair walker trays very disappointed toy 
-1	the suction cup n't stick the suction toys work fine seems cheap plastic/not stretchy enough 
-1	i loved concept item looking something could use high chair restaurants however , n't gotten practical use , makes sad first , i ca n't , life , get thing actually stick anything suction cup it 'll stick like 2 minutes tops , fall , 's n't even touch additionally , little one pulls entire thing 's base it 's not sturdy we 've put away 
-1	i thought would lot larger when i received , i shocked small the `` pull-back/release go '' feature n't work well , especially carpet ( even really short carpet ! ) my 7-month-old took one look turned nose at least cheap 
-1	we wanted little car 9 month old push around learning crawl thought would fun the popping balls similar old ball popper walked around kids opened car disapointing it definitely n't roll well carpet kind expected , however n't even roll well hardwood floor balls kind pop she still likes pick rattle balls around definitely not fun thought would we 're going get different car roll around hopfully work better not turn glorified rattle we would sent back paid 's not worth return shipping 
-1	this car cute small as another reviewer mentioned , 's size soft-ball i expecting i purchased however , i expecting pops forceful -- hardly tell balls popping -- move much car moving also , wind-up feature car i received appears defective -- stuck n't roll forward so , basically i ended expensive rattle good idea , wish worked better ! 
-1	so yes , car roll well , great rubber grips tires and yes , great size cute however , i disappointed rarely ball pop , ever the & # 34 ; pop & # 34 ; taken title i find push car happens contain little balls 
-1	we got set ( ) 8 month old months friend gave one plastic book pictures several objects it 99 cents store book but n't cheap design construction so thought would add variety bath time library wrong when i got i disappointed 2 things liked pros : - there 's photo album fit 4 pictures we use grandma family - the price ok compared options amazon cons : - books 3 sheets ( 6 pages ) as opposed 4 sheets ( 8 pages ) - `` illustrations '' called simple not `` baby simple '' , like `` repeat faces change colors put bow antenna '' simple - colors bright we 've learned babies comfortable high black white contrast newborn , later like ( see color ) explosive , contrasting colors overstimulate them - baby never gave much attention ! we later get sesame street ones ( gifts granny ) loves them - one books made cloth 's one banana smell touch oh smell chemical n't even smell artificial banana fragrance i hope review helpful ? ? 
-1	i bought thinking i would rather soft shield breast pump horns , i tried thing multiple occasions , let ( not way want breastfeeding lol ) this serves mo purpose decreases output pumping , stick normal horns ! 
-1	firstly , make sure get pack 2 price ! companies splitting selling separately i desperate work , sadly nothing the notch edge prevented fitting standard flange seal it seems negative reviews really needs design improvements and also seems works exact right size it seems minority women are i love ameda pump , customer support absolutely useless stimulator no info just pdf inadequate instructions , since none provided purchase also , phone support , email expect long wait times 
-1	i used struggle daughter wash hair n't like water face i thought would great solution it 's not by time cram kids head , 've lost already plus , ca n't really get perfectly positioned somewhere , always hair not getting rinsed/washed properly it 's better take time slowly get child used water leave gimmicky things like 
-1	i liked look description much i bought two , defective , different ways the purple one leaked place , seal twists closed how even happen ? you would think twist-close top would hold liquid on blue one , pull-up nozzle would n't stay , slid back , blocking drink flow i return 
-1	not great quality the lid broken i recieved i see it flimsy actually used 2 year old would broken sure i returned would not recommend anyone 
-1	why `` green '' toy made china ? i wish i heart buy company i go usa european made products choose avoid lacking standards asia too bad iplay cute products but i find better ones places 
-1	these ok changing table i always used pad anyway ended waste money i still taking space drawer 
-1	i like green sprout rattles better one this one moves twists much 's harder daughter hold shake i imagine 'll like months older

-1	i ignored reviews said product large baby mouths , looks perfect designed teether but right -- ring way big 6-month-old ( 's average size ) maybe 's two getting molars handy , 's going box 
-1	very flexible small , child push whole teether mouth this product recalled 
-1	this bowl attractive well-made we n't trouble dishwasher top rack however , n't buy bowl looking something stay stuck high chair tray i thought would work better bowls packaging store , looked like entire bottom suction cup not there 's rubber suction rim attached around bottom bowl ( 's colored rubber see ) , suction cup n't extend bowl it 's bare plastic perhaps 's suction power weak -- 's not fact suction cup , suction rim my daughter n't huge bowl thrower , n't generally try tear bowl tray 's focused eating ( i wanted suction bowl case changed ) we attach bowl tray beginning dinner , stays maybe two minutes , suction power gives bowl comes loose it 'd seconds focused ripping 
-1	i not like what pain wipe boob feeding now i know 's like breastfeed , i prefer reusable cloth pads medela 
-1	i really n't care they soothing first , warmed body temperature n't really seem much anything wish i saved money 
-1	these felt good , i took , stuck skin painful remove ! the whole point something soothed relieved sore nipples , , painful remove really defeats purpose very disappointed 
-1	in hospital , started nipple tenderness due establishing breastfeeding , nurses gave they swore sideways 'd best thing ever apparently work wonders women for , not much while cool sensation first put quite nice , lasted seconds beyond , use shields protect shirt , quite frankly , much cheaper ways product i 'm little baffled reading reviews women claim pads stuck firmly painful remove , left gooey residue i opposite problem - fell easily no residue , nothing i hold hands time moved around , otherwise 'd fall ( i warned nurses absolutely not combine use pads cream , would cause gel pads come also , n't cracked bleeding the combination pads either nipple creams blood might cause problems n't ) for , ultimately , pads waste time using plain oldlanolin , andnursing padsto protect breasts shirt , worked far better 
-1	they not stay cold long not help engorgement ! ! i break buy cabbage use cold compress works waaayyyyy better 
-1	i believe i reviewed product amazon , maybe another shell set/color we loved idea ai2 , really , seems green ai1 n't constantly going outer shells at first , worked great they fit fine ( yes , extra insert seemed bit long first ) absorbent kept everything we thrilled we used rockin green laundry detergent charlie soap always careful tucking velcro washing drying covers hand well , 8 months , changed my daughter 's bladder could hold good pee , diaper would leak i not keep diaper much hour fear leak everywhere i unfortunately recommended product friends experiencing issue babies ( around 1 year age ) my daughter 10 months old put disposable go period time ( 2 hours ! ) i extremely disappointed it bad i purchased system i not want spend money different system daycare day n't let us use cloth anyway i probably use future babies first months figure get older i would love say i go 100 % cloth birth 35 lbs , unfortunately , not case grobaby diapers 
-1	this diaper pad failed miserably my son 's onsie , bedding diaper soaked three hours sleep he 's 4 months old reason peeing soaker the design needs lot work it not dry fast like advertises either it takes longest dry pads absorbs least wt f i steering away grovia looking something works 
-1	i thought would handy 's pain i used 2 month old crunched i constantly looking make sure n't suffocating definitely not hands-free it bounces around it pretty good reviews 's i bought maybe i 'll try 's older 's closet collecting dust 
-1	i bought another one local store i twin babies toy since three months old when three months thing heavy couldnt grasp rings so put away forgot now six month old gave today its made hard material , whatever , miss mouth hit forehead hurts ! and ( tried like another review : ) the rings around middle gets way i throwing away its not great design little babies still working fine motor skills way solid hard 
-1	i bought & greenish circle rattle sassy well i thought good toy i noticed mold growing inside clear ball ! i yanked baby 's hand - biting i handwash time time ( not dishwasher ) since 's plastic i wish sassy 's quality control better i would 've exchanged another , i also noticed little one sometimes would hit head ball accident waves hands around holding toy so i returned 
-1	i n't think i bought , i see baby ca n't grab handle rings the rings tight enough handle 's tough grab instead she likes spinning mirror part though 
-1	baby likes , however son 3 months old , n't good control arms , hit head really hard left mark would recommend baby better motor skills 
-1	at first glance i thought would great toy 6-month old loves chewing holding items but i realized wings filled liquid-goo item plastic contains not seem thick i pressed nail feels like nail could pierce i pushed hard enough ! there no way i going give teething baby loves stick sharp little budding teeth everything hard i idea liquid , not something i want swallow that , plus fact reviewes say bits handle come apart kids ' mouths , i n't think toy safe sassy needs redesign product tell parents goo not come even , i would still not trust so many toys , take risk ? 
-1	i wiped toy clean per previous review seems baby 's drool may leaked inside one side looked bit wet inside 
-1	the rings fall time & infant throws side high chair ever get rid & likes everything lol ! 
-1	this essentially basic links nicer black white link just buy 24 pack links bright starts cheaper links money 
-1	purchased links purchased oval shaped links unfortunately not good come apart easily since openings placed mostly corners daughter pulls come right unlike oval shaped ones openings middle 's pulled stays intact gave item two stars cute 
-1	got water clear ball part first time i washed like , lot water i 'm not giving baby toy without washing first , especially not one 's made china , good toy filled water 's waiting grow mold i guess maybe 's good , teaches lesson not buy cheap made china crap 
-1	i give two stars pretty cute , not bad quality i tried several times putting baby never resulted good night 's sleep swaddling worked better unable kick feet around being able move legs around frustrated could n't get so , i never really got use maybe moms better luck 
-1	my 9 month old zero use toy she likes winkle not it 's made well 
-1	i n't think last long the wash rags held together tape -- tape stronger wash cloth ! when i took , terry cloth came tape left bare spot still apparent running wash disappointing 
-1	i registered received baby gift we always purchase high quality towels washcloths ( clearance tj maxx $ 5 towels $ 2-3 washcloths i love deals find without problem looking ) believing get pay knowing last several years even losing fluffiness my husband insisted getting infant sized washcloths reason i still not understand settled registry with name like spasilk description 100 % cotton , sounded perfect when arrived , exactly like terry cloth shop rags i get sam 's club better washing - rough , scratchy , practically see-though spots fine rags ; not human wash and , threads pulled place cheaper i got cheapest 1 star hotel i stayed pool towel ! i also n't care lack attention detail appeared go selecting coordinating colors the trim material green mint green not like shade green used towels thus , far cuter pictures real life we used one bathtime great deal crying towel went lot scratch marks baby drying i watching clearance racks softer towels washcloths ! just like another reviewer said , i bought locally , i would returned it not worth hassle return 
-1	i received three different sets hooded towels baby gifts one i like least it n't plush brands ( carter 's ducky towel favorite three ) got even rougher texture wash the frog applique hood also stiff not really nice baby 's forehead gets bit rolled washes wont lay flat anymore with name `` spasilk '' would expecting softer material , isn't i would spend couple extra dollars buy set plush soft , especially babies delicate skin 
-1	while cute , quality aesthetics n't really live picture online we registered without seeing person , 's going back , : - it 's made china amazon listing read `` imported '' without specification registered us standards materials point ; n't yet regulate imported fabric products based chemicals used treat this means run decent risk 's 100 % cotton treated stuff would n't want near , much less baby , since 're given virtually information consumers , ca n't know chemicals wash first wash ( always prewash baby apparel/towels/cloths ) either way , i would n't want add nasty chemicals water system wash i n't boycott imports , terms safety concerns , chinese products worst offenders ( although bonafide certified organic factories china , however rare ) my rule used `` n't lick , 's china '' , breathe emissions micro-particles things around ( thus `` indoor pollution '' ) while ca n't protect anyone sketchy substances , i try reduce number questionable products i expose baby regular basis minimize bio-accumulation choosing another towel set , , reasonable attempt - reviewers wrote fabric rough point this set not soft plush - it n't look durable - it 's actually lot cuter online in-person 
-1	you get pay these towels thin not absorbent the certainly n't keep little one warm 's bath save money buy one nice hooded towel you n't really need one 
-1	look 100 % cotton towels skip 80/20 cotton/poly blends they 're not fluffy aden+anais towels , 're super thin , 're not warm either and 're thin , n't last washes well either 
-1	i fooled picture okay , lot fault i read weight dimensions course 's obvious photos make things appear bigger reality nonetheless , i 've never quite fooled like size these clothes tiny tiny tiny you think `` wow , pack 10 ! '' really add barely 1 decent sized cloth also , incredibly thin not absorbent they made thicker i n't buy excuse thin = gentle = better baby you make thicker , absorbent , super soft still fact , would dry clean baby faster baby ends less frustrated if baby could speak , would say , `` i know i 'm 7lbs , size washcloth still joke ! '' 
-1	after reading great reviews , i ordered baby due shortly being new mom , everything baby , i wash even goes nursery i disappointed i started folding found edges half already unraveling ! even low price not justify terrible quality 
-1	love cute designs washcloths perfect size quality poor the stitching edges began unraveling one two uses i always dealing dangling strings frayed edges i never purchased washcloths fell apart quickly 
-1	i found thin rough we returned just not right level softness baby 
-1	very rough dry -- scratchynever even used threads unwinding arrived thankfully i able return ( we instead use gerber baby washcloths -- good price soft much better quality ) 
-1	i not used yet , i received baby shower gift i washed already fraying all edges curl longer square , rectangular warped not pleased 
-1	the product 80 % cotton 20 % polyester it 's soft not much , still serves 's purpose for customer really wants 100 % cotton aware product itsn't also 's veeeery thin becomes rough wash use 
-1	when i got i little disappointed small thin i ended not really using if i balled one would size golf ball not really good size use wash cloth as i mentioned really thin well i felt like i put light i could see right just not really expected 
-1	maybe i 'm spoiled i 've purchased many soft organic items these washcloths right size , not soft , almost gritty i ca n't recommend there must softer brand 
-1	packs 12 washcloths great ! ! ! one 10 gave two stars material folding , 's thin wish would n't fold dry 
-1	as soon i got i regretted purchase they incredibly thin , barely absorb anything without long-time soaking the ends curl , , even folding difficult the colors fade stains stay forever , i incredibly disappointed i use rag son suck i 'm using better-quality washcloths this one item , son outgrows , wo n't keeping next baby 
-1	i not really reviewing quality hooter hider functionality i bought baby week old he 14 weeks old i never used i find lot convenient nurse wearing baggy shirt blanket then i see face not noticeable people i think hooter hider actually draws attention fact nursing looks really weird opinion it also expensive piece fabric totally make there nothing strong opening top others said hold open see baby this purchase i regret making 
-1	after one use , i unable close clasps product completely useless i would not recommend purchase 
-1	i 've using bumkins diaper liners happy wanted try since 's less packaging comes roll rather tissue paper style definitely not soft absorbent they 're also not big even mother helps babysit day asked happened old liners ( i e bumkins ) she refuses use would rather go without liners sticking bumkins ! 
-1	these liners horrible , got wet stuck daughter 's skin gave diaper rash , not started using cleared stopped 
-1	these not flushable ! we used week call plummer snake main line wad jammed pipe ! $ 180 pluming bill ! 
-1	super flimsy rip easily i ended mess cloth diapers anyways completely pointless my daughter got major diaper rash well 
-1	this product good theory i wanted portable way sterilize sons nipples pacifiers the bags seem work fine sterilization purposes , spark microwave i made sure items bag nipples , plastic materials , still cause microwave spark my microwave 2 years old , stainless steel , nothing special the bags nice feature front allows keep track uses great hot free spot touch bag take microwave they also made way vent easily bag without fear scalding all good things , i cant get past sparking issue 
-1	these bags annoyed i finally took scissors vent cut would drain like medela bags i n't 10 minutes patience wait water trickle i adult brain i understand hot water pours , i would like pour quickly 
-1	i bought shade travel hot sunny climate i really disappointed performance the shade actually quite small not provide much sun coverage and clamp not firmly attach bar chico liteway stroller shade would constantly swing side slide bar after attempts make umbrella work us , i gave toy son i really wish i not spent money product 
-1	i keep tightening umbrella , keeps moving falling and swings slightest breeze i stopped using 'm afraid 's going fall daughters face it hooks onto stoller fine , 's not issue get right position tighten , stays minutes flops i even husband tighten kept falling i wanted umbrella cute functional , i i look something strictly functional 
-1	thought i could attach stroller it wo n't stay place it swivel fall regardless stroller i try use not best collecting dust ! 
-1	we month loved i tasted toddlers food it tastes strongly like plastic ever put type food fat like milk , butter , meat etc too bad very disappointed i put dishwasher not sure changed 
-1	my fault not reading fine print , wipes not fully organic as matter fact , description ( honest ) say `` fuzzi bunz organic cotton/polyester fleece double sided wipes '' possible make double-sided wipe one side organic cotton one side organic fleece i first time mom , trying cloth diapering organic natural fibers luckily , i bought one package fuzzibunz wipes one package several types when cloth diapering , not use fabric softener laundry else absorbency diapers wipes reduced dramatically without softener , wipes generated enough static electricity power house i found stuck everything -- daughter 's clothes , diapers , towels , sheets , name i n't wash separately diaper laundry , instead , i got rid for , total waste money why pay organic cotton , end , rubbing little one 's sensitive parts polyester ? ! 
-1	we bought baby 4 5 months old help increase leg strength she small n't get use right away now , 8 months old , 17 pounds 's max height longer use i feel like waste money she hardly got use do n't waste money 
-1	yes , not babies get flat head sleeping sleeper , many good reviews reflect ; however , i wish i read reviews getting item i take baby craniofacial specialist flat spot sleeper caused right back side head my pediatrician noticed flat spot 2 months we stopped using sleeper immediately , deal constant re-positioning keeping head much possible avoid getting helmet shape head correctly her head still misshapen 4 months , specialist no , not happen babies - however , i knew slight risk i would never taken chance 
-1	i would give product 3 5 stars i could when first got baby 2 months old she suffering acid reflux would often spit sleep lying flat we tried elevating bassinet n't work she never slept 20-30 minutes flat bassinet crib this sleeper lifesaver her first night slept 5 6 hours straight now , sleeps least 6-8 hours straight , wakes bottle , sleeps another 2-3 hours but complaint really n't suitable babies long period time while i enjoyed sleeping slept long periods , addicted sleeper ( 's 5 mos ) it 's really hard weaning ! this sounds silly , 's huge transition go inclined , cozy , rocking sleep environment stiff mattress large crib any tips parents , i would welcome ! that 's reason i give 4 stars , i 'd recommend parents use sparingly help babies get acid reflux flare ups control maybe occassional naps it lifesaver , i ca n't complain , i regrets again , tips wean babies sleeper would appreciated ! ! ! : ) i 'm updating previous review , i 'm not sure alot people product so i finally transitioned 6-month old crib sleeper it sooo painful , many nights crying although helped short-term , i really regret using rock n play the transition hard now 's crib , i also see much restricting movement , necessary infants settle sleep for reason , i 'm downgrading review 2 stars it really n't worth end 
-1	this rocker awesome first months daughter 's life now helmet i wore , plenty tummy time ever back asleep she developed plagiocephaly result sleeper to fair , tight neck muscles meant favoured one side rocker restricts movement much , head always faced right developed flat spot result she wear helmet least 3 months cost thousands i not using sleeper ever ! 
-1	please read : i loved first , kicking using much ! my son slept first 10 weeks , including naptime he tummy time , floor time , held lot also he 6 months old helmet past 5 weeks treat severe flat spot caused positioning i not know late flat spots not caused sleeping backs , car seat , swing , sleeper far worse crib ! being first time mom , i idea harm i causing i love convenience -- easy move room room , folds small take wherever go i small house size perfect -- large pack n play move around fit small space my son still takes naps occasionally sleeps night ( helmet , i figure ca n't cause harm ) if i another child though , not used my baby helmet least 6 months get head near normal range beware careful ! the convenience not worth inconvenience strain baby causes added original review 4/25/2011 : my son year old still flat spot , even 8 months wearing helmet he always flat spot , hopefully less noticable gets older the neuro-surgean said flat spot worst ever seen the improvement helmet , since started severe , ca n't get back `` normal '' range head shape ! i ca n't tell much i regret using rocker imagine causing something child could prevented i n't know do n't make mistake i 
-1	my son slept sleeper night birth almost 3 months it n't long i noticed favoring one side sleeper , side becoming increasingly flattened we tried positioning better would sleep back head , became flattened at 3 months i noticed slouching looked crunched sleeper , i immediately stopped using our pediatrician n't seemed concerned , 4 months head still n't getting better even though rarely back day we finally referred specialist kept voicing concerns pediatrician turns son diagnosed severe brachycephaly moderate plagiophaly i shocked learn flattening back head causing facial asymmetry widening forehead ! ! ! i n't even noticed beautiful baby getting worse not better we getting fitted $ 3,800 helmet 'll wear 23 hrs day next several months he also torticollis , tightening neck muscles , caused way favored one side sleeper he daily stretches hates , hopefully wo n't need physical therapy i truly believe sleeper caused problems i would not recommend product anyone 's not worth risk 
-1	yes , reviews true -- our daughter slept day one , slept beautifully she started sleeping night early age , amazed sleeper allowed sleep long periods night ( ate frequently day , rarely woke night ) our daughter gaining weight perfectly happy , healthy , meeting exceeding developmental milestones ; however , daughter 8 weeks old , i noticed i thought flat spot developing back head , pediatrician told could n't see at 16 weeks , i felt flat spot gotten worse -- this time , went see neurosurgeon , diagnosed daughter deformational brachycephaly -- flathead syndrome she must wear helmet correct head shape although sleeper probably miracle product children acid reflux , gerd , colic , etc without doubt allowed daughter sleep too well -- caused flat spot develop the back head completely flat once moved crib 16 weeks , wakes every single night eat -- i 'm thrilled i strongly believe fisher price needs market device not all-night sleep device , something infant might sit spend 10 minutes folding laundry emptying dishwasher it ca n't used something sleep night , every night the bottom line : if decide purchase , infant starts sleep long stretches night , pay particular attention back his/her head if notice flat spot , i 8 weeks , i 'd get rid product asap 
-1	after reading many great reviews the one thing i really wanted registry however , i n't see everyone enthralled when brought home , i felt like tiny thing he ended sleeping arms first month would n't really sleep , i truthfully n't mind i wanted room us once kind started sleeping , started breathing really funny deep sleep stage then one night literally gasping air way positioned ( properly i mind ) that i decided start crib no breathing issues now i know doctors recommend sleeping flat backs 
-1	this cover oversized piece thick plastic wrap like present around mattress two ends weak tape it hard get tight n't overlap firm fit it makes nervous 's claims prevent sids frustrating it makes difficult change sheets , etc i would not recommend cover would purchase one 
-1	this thermometer complete waste money says reads 5 seconds n't one 5 second reading yet horrible product , especially squirmy baby please n't waste money ! ! 
-1	i would give product 5 stars touch feel very soft easy wear wash however awful containing amount leak i go 6 pads morning and forget working night the smallest amount milk soaks right bra shirt i gone back disposable pads 
-1	well , i bought i bought bamboobies these nursing pads not absorbent enough , also shrunk i washed i washed bamboobies time not shrink , absorb well super soft 
-1	pads ok size wise i liked packaging 's soaked thru quickly i end washing every day you would need buy lot week supply i use home use disposable pads i 'm 
-1	what weird shape the edges n't lay flat wearing bra not favorite look look like hockey pucks i also pretty small breasts , even nursing mom , would think pads would always place often i rearrange pad cover nipple letdown i forget milk soaks one side pad thoroughly leaks i would n't recommend anyone 
-1	i wanted like bad 're useless first , leak right ( ) i n't mind also quite bulky thick 
-1	i bought hoping switch away disposables second i leaked , went directly pad shirt no absorbancy do n't waste money 
-1	but thick i could n't wear day , small , diameter-wise , really n't good night shifting sleep also , i leak , kind got crusty surface , i stuck 
-1	i got try pregnant , i issues needed ointment they worked great containing ointment stains , n't greatest absorbency while i commend company trying help minimize waste , n't great i leak quicker disposables i 've tried i 'm not heavy leaker , usually dripping feeding prolonged , i usually go 3 pairs ( 6 pads ) less 48 hours they also shrank bit dryer noticeable un-padded thin bras i 'll use around house , maybe liner disposables i 'm going awhile want extra protection , i intentions stocking 
-1	these pads not working , milk goes straight soaks bra shirt they probably good drip like couple drops every ( n't even need pads really ) i disappointed , price n't total loss try washable option i need waterproof lining , make the issue i shift lot adhesive maybe bigger would help prevent problem 
-1	basically n't use pads , leaking clothes withing 1-2 minutes breast feeding i recommend buying pads waterproof back 
-1	i tried twice gave i sensitive skin get rashes easily plastic end getting lansinoh ultra soft pads 
-1	it easily shows bra you see round circle it completely cotton , leak , leaks bra shows they not absorbent they not practical i first nursing leaking lot , i would go one set feeding they comfortable , though ! i like fact washable saved money compared disposable ones 
-1	i 4 months nursing career i leak early morning lo 's first feeding sometimes quite bit starts crying i nurse i got sick using disposables i thought would good solution wrong they not absorbent even washing per recommendation milk goes right rather pad soaking i would not recommend heavy leakers maybe good use precautionary leakage daytime hours 
-1	these really thick , looked horrible clothes i used times night , i would n't recommend friend 
-1	these great idea , sadly , not absorbent need they soft comfortable , n't hold enough milk really useful as much i hate use disposable products , i switched medela disposable pads absorb ton liquid never leak 
-1	i n't know work terms leakage protection i never actually got test as soon i put inside cotton nursing bra , i saw two huge bulging circles mirror , nipples showing boot no thank back went 
-1	even though 're wearing nursing pads n't mean shirt n't get wet still unless wear pad protective layer these n't protective layer , keep washing still leak shirt times not awesome , try 
-1	i n't think i leak much , 's mostly let-down nursing i soaked right hours they n't seem hold much liquid , catch stays one spot it n't distribute liquid whole pad , nipple ends staying fairly moist i gave two stars instead one super soft , fairly invisible clothing , inexpensive 
-1	i ordered pack 12 pads i received mail yesterday initially i thought quite nice soft i threw washer get ready first use followed care instructions i always do the problem i already ( i n't even used yet ) fact 4 pads kept nicely shape size , 5 shrunk half original size oval shaped , 2 completely deformed ca n't even pulled shape turned sort ball well last one turned missing together my fault not counting prior washing i suppose either way i receive partial refund amazon missing pad n't change fact two third order misshapen sense crappy investment i n't used pads yet i not make statement absorbancy comfort i update status soon i thoroughly tested 4 usable pads but based current experience n't even matter well hold - i would not purchase this item again 
-1	i really wanted love cup holder i looking forward adding current cup holder ( i e side stroller , even behind current one ) , husband i enjoy separate beverages about alas , wo n't even safely attach stroller ( we mamas & papas ; sola ) it really seems like , order get good , tight fit , need vertical bar zero verticals travel system we horizontal diagonal the image amazon really misleading it appears though cup holder attached black top , instead , whole side back ( unseen picture ) velcro straps ) keep mind , thinking buying this on upside , quite large , i see fitting bottle water nicely i also like metallic fabric , though come scrunched bit , i think placing object days might help stand upright better again maybe baby older , attach safety bar use cup snacks until waste money update : i 've really begun hate cup holder it n't attach well anywhere i tried using baby 's water bottle keeps tilting no tight fit possible sola ! 
-1	meh to honest i n't found stroller hook i like yet company , maybe i 'm looking something n't existing- regardless , flop 
-1	these definitely not authentic aden anais brand know love these definitely lesser quality not hold well expensive ones i wish would specify , instead selling like good quality ones they also sell way less these washed , shrank edges became wavy it could not stretched back original shape 
-1	i many aden anais products - swaddle blankets , dream blankets , bibs , wash cloths i love products so i high expectations sleep sack very dissapointed say least it thin i knew single layer muslin ; however , seems thinner swaddle blanket , almost see the quality not i expect products i ended purchasing halo sleep sack instead 
-1	i sure way knowing beforehand , covers n't work outlets i track home built 2006 standard outlets i guess i unscrewed covers screwed ones unfortunately , gap wall cover it not sit flush wall that seems unsafe , actually i felt like baby could twist covers not secure mounting i like plastic plug remove put somewhere close yet reach n't work also , color covers different standard ones these gray white i would dealt minor color difference fit securely i ca n't use unfortunately , i ordered 12 pack : ( not worth returning not worth using 
-1	i got ergo daughter year i n't know use newborn son i got ca n't say good i could never get natural , comfortable hold i used moby newborn days 
-1	my baby 8 pounds born i , found easier tuck blanket butt this like huge winter coat wraps around & still ergo around i found way hot & bulky i took swaddle blanket , tucked butt & worked much better ! and grew i could change amount blanket actually adjustable 
-1	this worked pretty well us the problem baby person carrying would covered sweat pretty quickly we live germany cold snowing christmas , still take breaks let baby cool - usually change dry clothes 
-1	my daughter born july hated infant insert it way hot , cried every time tried put we used moby wrap instead , love we like ergo carrier lot , wait older use dad particularly likes ergo 
-1	i bought new infant insert like everyone else hoping would support baby ergobaby the ergobaby seems like great son gets older , infant insert n't make sense my son squished hot not mention n't support head when 's leaning backwards looks like straining neck n't offer much support i n't know i 'm wrong 's looking straight towards sky , ca n't comfortable ! if leans forward right chin i ca n't look around i 'm afraid ca n't breathe to honest son i hate stupid thing i wish would come better instructions use i might try others said use cushion , 4 weeks i n't think 'll enough head control maybe line 'll work i 'm excited use carrier without insert 
-1	this second ergo infant insert i 've bought i bought one hoping would work better old infant insert it n't basically , newborn n't like ergo carrier , 's likely neither insert going help you test ergo newborn spending money my husband i loved idea ergo carrier , hip belt helps alleviate back problems much like packs backpacking , registered one but however much like carrier , eight-week-old , 10 5 pound daughter hates i 've trying get ergo using first old infant insert , heart 2 heart , repeatedly ever since born , success the moment i put ( insert ) ergo carrier , starts screaming n't stop i take i 've watched video old insert ( note : 's video heart 2 heart ) following technique exactly , still hates carrier neither insert provides enough head support daughter , i think screams the heart 2 heart particular n't work ; 's settled per instructions , insert n't come high enough support head , 's not particularly long child so head flops forward tries look around , frustrates her both inserts feel like bit afterthought -- i 'm not convinced ergo carrier designed newborns mind having baby 's feet one side old insert seemed like stopgap solution , heart 2 heart n't quite solve issue , either interestingly , i picked used baby bjorn last resort spent money ergo inserts , likes bjorn , 's stiffer provides support i think wo n't like ergo head 's bit steadier ; 'll go back ergo then so 's worth knowing buying insert may may not money well spent -- depends whether child likes not , 's possibility wo n't ( i 've seen multiple reports various sites saying newborns also n't like ergo ; wish i 'd done research getting ergo spending money inserts ) it 's worth waiting baby born trying infant inserts buying otherwise , may want hold ergo 4-5 months 
-1	my problem insert thick is-down comforter thick it 's hot san diego weather i strip onesie get sweaty i wear i ca n't wait 's big enough go without 
-1	our baby small ergo carrier purchased got it $ 30 , basically fancy pillow sit the wrap-around part provided head support the instructions said used four months , able put average-sized baby ergo without around 10 weeks it total waste money 
-1	awkward newborn it 's weird way sit it 's easier wait hold head do n't waste money 
-1	they trying make use newborn well , floppy newborns need support my son n't happy and still , i afraid head flopping around i put now older n't flop , n't need so waste money 
-1	i love ergo i bjorn first daughter , fine uses daily i decided try ergo next one literally not live without my 8 month old still uses however , i found insert unnecessary i read directions correctly , felt cumbersome my daughter n't like either she fit much better regular ergo , even newborn she weighed 7 5 birth lost weight 5th percentile since so , n't huge newborn i n't think necessary the regular ergo amazing enough 
-1	this insert tricky use it designed way babys legs inside carrier , uncomfortable babys legs inside , squished body baby it also get hot summer the best thing wait baby old enough use ergo carrier without insert 
-1	this infant insert basically mini comforter my son hates , sweats gets heat rash - absolutely not use warm weather i wrote ergo response - son probably big enough not use anymore ( 3 months time ) well 's great , first three months not able carry carrier we opted not buy another carrier spent much ergo i would go different newborn carrier possibly buy ergo baby bigger i hopefully like ergo without 
-1	my advice bright starts sugar blossom melodies bouncer not waste time money yes , affordable , case getting less paid it cheaper cheap you better spending extra bucks purchasing bouncer better quality i suggest fischer price bouncers i purchased bright starts sugar blossom melodies bouncer ( currently 3 month old ) niece i babysit week parents always lugging fischer price bouncer , i thought would convenient purchase i found bright starts sugar blossom melodies bouncer amazon , thought i hit gold mine it super affordable , looks adorable , overall star rating decent i unfortunately , n't take time read reviews instantly regretted bright starts bouncer delivered my pluses/pros bright starts sugar blossom melodies bouncers extremely affordable , easy assemble , hanging toys adorable let start saying i n't expecting assemble quite much every aspect bouncer needed assembled the assembly instructions easy relatively quick assemble this product also takes three `` c '' batteries , not included ( course ) on hand , product unfortunately epic fail every way my first problem product pad baby lays once i attached frame secured back , extremely tight i could bounced quarter i actually afraid going rip attaching , i put niece got stretched weight there not indentation baby lies , appears picture i figured possible might stretch use , i not sure amount washing pad would continue fit time it barely fit first assemble more importantly , i afraid safety niece taunt pad extreme angle chair i afraid would slid , get extreme wedgie , even movement might fall forward ( like starts `` try '' lift head ) my second issue product , one i never saw mentioned reviews sound vibrations the chair one level vibrations two levels music , softer level louder level unfortunately , even loudest music level , i could barely music vibrate setting the vibration so loud i could literally hear whatever oscillating inside plastic box make chair vibrate some babies may find sound soothing , i certainly n't want listen though it loud , seemed defeat purpose music i mean ca n't hear vibration , ? lastly , i issue toy bar the toy bar location not adjustable this would fine , except since pad tight/taunt chair angle extreme literally makes bar inches away babies face it close comfort in end , i returned product i n't see bright starts sugar blossom melodies bouncer lasting months niece would using i worried safety using and despite affordable , n't even worth i certainly would n't recommend product even price i suggest spending extra bucks get something safe , durable , quiet , fun child

-1	yes , bra allows pump hands-free , i 'd researched things little better , i would ordered different bra instead the medela bra not adjustable i 've lost 20 lbs baby weight since i started pumping 's looser also , sewing already coming apart ; i 've used twice day 3 months washed times i n't tried , simple wishes makes similar product adjustable recommended breastfeeding counselor area ; i would consider one instead 
-1	this worked awhile i lost weight i much prefer kind adjusts size changes 
-1	i received gift baby shower i happy find product like i 9 year old baby with 9 year old i pumped exclusively either & # 8217 ; products like i never saw the first time i saw i knew great idea unfortunately , particular product & # 8217 ; work me it i ordered one size bigger i usually would reading reviews it fit ok , top loose felt like slipping the bustier closes zipper the zipper annoying opinion then week use zipper broke it seems like could & # 8217 ; fashioned something little better a friend mine gave advice make i took old sports bra put i felt i needed holes go cut 2 small holes this gives support since goes shoulders , especially heavier bottles it also virtually free ( i & # 8217 ; wear sports bra much anymore ) i much happier homemade solution , rather rather expensive alternative i give credit coming fabulous idea it could & # 8217 ; saved ton time 9 years ago makes pumping not annoying since i eat , respond emails , play phone , write sons baby book , read book , ect 
-1	i bought target i thought would help pump since i exclusively pump right it works extent not like advertise ! first women ads obviously not breastfeeding , tell looking breasts 's bit misleading second not hold breast shields straight like advertised , sag i still hold get best milk supply if let hang n't pump well i bought i could hands free ! the bra bit tight i got medium based sizing chart it holds breast shields place problem 's bit hard get on i use see way i fix kinks it help not like i expected price worked better ok using week i ca n't stand ! it tight hinders pumping ! if i got size would big this thing needs strap goes around neck otherwise hangs bottles pulls nipples ! the women advertising bra not breastfeeding ads very misleading why not use actual breastfeeding woman ? this thing not fit right the lady ads boobs ! sorry baby way chick ads this bra waste money i going sell lowest bidder done i come device pump hands free actually works breastfeeding mothers 
-1	i 36c pregnant , 36 f/g i thought large would adequate , xl would better anyway , works being handsfree lets breast massage/compressions pumping , turns make difference nothing something , output-wise great product the zipper pain , hard get latched base stays put edit -- using bra daily six months , i change review it worked great two months , zipper broke i contacted medela overnighted new one great ! but zipper broke one month i hesitate call again , i guess i this time i want money back i buy simple wishes bra instead 
-1	the first time i went use zipper broke i bought 6 months ago baby born ready i tried first thing zipper broke i shimmy damn thing 
-1	a hands free bustier must bfing mom wants pump i could never get good fit one for much better fit try thesimple wishes hands-free breastpump bra , pink , xs/s/m it 's adjustable allow good fit woman 
-1	i found product awkward use the cut outs holding pump could better designed could bra i use handless pumping bra ( simple wishes ) wash i would not purchase bra recommend anyone unlike simple wishes bra , 've finished pumping , take bra bc 's uncomfortable conspicuous clothes 
-1	this n't work well this good concept works well , i really think based size my breast large really use granted would stay place , would still hold ( like lady picture ) defeated purpose 
-1	the bra tight , tight top part rolls armpits - not comfortable i using avent 's small glass bottles heavy bra support even tight bra i still hold suction n't broken 
-1	maybe couldnt get comfortable thing i found not using returned 
-1	i got , well , i target gift cards carried it works alright , i always leakage made little stinky end day that meant i wash everyday i decided get another make easier simple wishes cost , i decided try way better fits better , secure , leaks n't need cleaned everyday , price i actually dial suction pump back held shields much better the medela sits work locker case i forget beloved simple wishes have n't used months 
-1	but i 'm not surprised neither medium large fit i 34e/f wear medium bravado seamless nursing bra ( reference ) comfortably this impossible fit properly the medium right band , tight/not enough fabric top the large loose i could pull breasts without unzipping ! to make matters worse , holes cut within 2 '' band ! ? wrong orientation nipples , medela i ticked nursing bra companies think get away lumping sizes together a 32g 42a not size ! ! ! looks like i get save $ $ butcher one sports bras , yay 
-1	these nipples very fast flow my baby choking milk coming i n't recommend using anything stage 2 
-1	i 'm worried nipples flow fast i wish i 'd gone different bottle system i friends glass bottles 've better experiences 
-1	i read lot places , seat very hard install even works originally installed 2003 jetta , struggle got we got mini cooper countryman , pretty much impossible install , unsafe even driving car fought hours could never even get slightly stable standing still swapped britax boulevard went really really easy put 2000 bmw 540ia ( latch ) , wabblier heck , boulevard easy install too nice seat , easier get child , bucket seats , forget , unusable , even normal seats , extremely hard time putting seat 
-1	i 've using warmer 8 months not impressed the wipes lukewarm best , n't pop well i often shove hand container retreive ( easier small hand , however husband difficult time ! ) the pin attaching door unit always sliding loose awkward push back the entire unit slides dresser top i try pull wipe , well i appreciate little light , turns ten minutes , although button could easier push ( , unit slides around , ca n't armful baby expect turn easily ) i would not recommend warmer , i n't wasteful , would get rid yesterday when 're ready baby numero 2 , find one local thrift shop although i would n't recommend getting , either , even is good deal ) ! 
-1	we bought variety cloth diapers use newborn we not new cloth diapering diapered oldest cloth potty trained we used one size fuzzibunz oldest without problems however , n't start 10 weeks we bought diaper try not like the insert difficult get it leaked almost every time used and daughter seemed outgrow one month old 10 lbs it , however , soft i would not purchase newborn 
-1	one larger cloth diapers tried , fuzzibunz perfect size fits relatively well not bulky ( although not nearly adjustable all-in-ones ) n't last long , even following manufacturer 's washing/drying instructions we used diapers intermittently year waterproof lining disintegrated probably wo n't buy , especially price 
-1	if used sizing old made usa china fuzzibunz , new `` made turkey '' fuzzibunz unpleasant surprise my experience applies large perfect size the new ones least two inches taller rise back much wider my 24 month daughter ( 30 pounds , 35 inches ) went trim fit larges made china ( second snaps ) bulky fit tightest setting new ones all extra material bunches legs diaper hangs butt the fleece soft textured ( i prefer old ones better ) leg elastic less trim overall , i not pleased changes trying different brands second daughter due soon maybe i 'm still potting-training year 18 months , fit , 's hard imagine daughter 's already rotund belly getting much wider , i understand , sizes much higher rise wider waist , i 'm doubtful mediums would work for i use overnight n't fit clothes it 's shame i much fuzzibunz devotee they great customer service ( replaced 5 diapers , several warranty ) , i n't like product , n't help much 
-1	i would not recommend wet bag anyone ! within month two using , zipper came track my husband repaired , keep problem also , bag leaked we use planet wise bag daily daycare problems i purchased another planet wise bag use wash i 've also problems hanging diaper pail bag leaking bottom not like way wipes shrank unevenly two sides i love fuzzibunz diapers , accessories terrible ! i never purchase anything except diapers also , i tried contacting customer support received response post ( they longer list customer service phone number website ) please read reviews i ca n't believe people giving 4 stars ever use ! 
-1	bag not waterproof water leaks bottom zipper also top not close smell escape top 
-1	i like size , shape , material bag it never leaked i wash diapers every day my compliant laundry day odor diapers not contained bag i thought draw string closure , 's always open top it 's nice able hang save floor space , even putting essential oil fabric tab ( located bottom bag , diapers i n't want dig tab reapply oil ! ) n't really change odor i wonder moms desensitized dirty diaper smells cloth long ? i may use line pail lid instead this would make nice large size wet bag whole family 's bathing suits summer time 
-1	zipper broke bags pretty fast , elastic n't adjust fit diaper i wo n't buy blueberry makes much better one 
-1	i 2 diapers i also bumgenius 4 0 , katydid ( oh katy ) , knickernappies , grobaby/grovia ( hybrid diaper ) this diaper one i like least pocket diapers my daughter turned 2 28lbs 36in tall tall slender , way supertall this diaper barely fits ( honestly , i compared fuzzibunz perfect size small , slightly larger one ! ) it super low rise , i widest snaps how fatter/taller baby supposed fit diaper , i idea as result low rise , leaked back diaper one insert i double stuff diaper every time ensure n't leak , creates lot bulk the inserts completely soaked i pull , even wearing 2-3 hours ( amount time i keep bumgenius ) i also hate adjustable elastic leg gussets , much pain butt using two babies ( i , 2m old ) having adjustable rise snaps much easier , even allows less customizable rise options all diapers 3 snap rise options , opinion , enough in comparison bumgenius diapers ( people compare diaper ) , i find fuzzibunz : smaller ( tighter lower ) harder stuffless absorbenti think katydid/oh katy diapers similar bg diapers , ones i like second best the knickernappies pretty high rise also , weird side snaps , not favorite grobaby/grovia different kind system , i not sure good comparison , low rise , i n't find works well tall kids 
-1	first , diapers cutest things i ever seen the colors bright fun they look absolutely adorable son , diaper goes camera comes every time but past cuteness phase , reality n't great i originally invested diapers battle diaper rash , logic , i 'll let baby sleep cloth diapers give little rear break bad idea , even 2 inserts , baby blankets soaked every morning ok , fine 'll cloth diapers day cue second issue diapers , 're bulky ! the onesies would n't snap around big bulge i move pants size and leaking continued , always soaking around thighs most people tell cleaning cloth diapers biggest inconvenience , fuzzi buns part easy , leaking bulkiness ultimately kept son disposals 
-1	i bought i pregnant first son i bought 24 pack one size elite hopes would diapers buy , thus saving money ( let 's face , number one reason cloth diaper ) i used soon umbilical cord fell worked great i add 8 pounds even birth ebf 2 months old i followed care instructions t hit 4 months i noticed started leaking sides so i adapted started changing often then made difference , started leaking front crotch i thought ok , maybe needs sized differently ( which sizing diapers whole issue ) you practically take apart change size elastics stretched others diaper different size i tried stripping avail by time hit six months 23 pounds not fit even largest setting i furious i talked husband enough enough i ordered bumgenius 4 0 i pregnant found much better so i redid stash bg 4 0 never looked back i would n't order again i say though , contain poo pretty well none stains 's somewhat plus update : i actually sold friend mine son teensy baby loves so really depends size baby 
-1	we use pocket diapers , mainly bumgenius , i also like try products i really wanted love diaper , 's worst one 've tried the fit horrible there way many ways size diaper i n't time adjust 5 different straps get good fit crawling baby ( would baby sit still ) i tried three times get good fit gave there two elastic sizing side inside pocket one back diaper due ( i 'm assuming ) fit i could not achieve , many leaks diaper if get diaper fit little one , i 'm sure would good diaper i much prefer ease using bumgenius 
-1	yes , nice , pretty colors , good quality , not bulky make baby 's bum dry so leak almost every time ? i three glad i n't buy i use home outfit change given wearing i 've using 6 months my advice : 're pregnant baby buy one use couple times see works i bought three based fact 's reputable brand regret 
-1	i 'm glad i bought one it says good 10 lbs 10 lb baby wears bulky it also leaks it leaked bad one night jammies bed sheets soaked morning if leaks 7 weeks old bad leak 's older pees ? one elastic bands not stay hole it continuously pops rubs kids skin i like snaps , pocket , cover however , i like bum genius 4 0 thirsties better i tried emailing company regarding leak never heard response 
-1	i disappointed unfortunately used months large rotation started tear fall apart along seams i disappointed i heard lot good things fuzzibunz this made hesitant try diapers 
-1	we used son born , ended replacing within 6 months the fleece pilled , cotton side rough he screaming changes they also fell apart rather quickly they n't work us 
-1	i high hopes product it good qualities i like 's sturdy versatile i extremely annoyed vibration terrible when i turn switch button vibrates inside plastic turn makes entire chair loud ! vibration works cheap plastic vibrates well i tried put tape button 's n't vibrate well nothing works also , swinging toy less great i 'm not enthused product 
-1	i grandmother raised several children i know babies i 9 week old infant living bought chair i wish i bought something else i find rocker infant position baby slumps side side due width chair also infant position feet held much higher head this occurs incline seat infant position therefore ca n't use seat feeding secondly , padding head area several hard lumps padding not thick padding slight skimpy last not least , use vibrate feature , battery makes horrible racket banging plastic battery holder seat frame it loud ca n't use it on positive side , baby attracted bright toys tries reach i also like way toy bar moves way this purchase arrived much earlier amazon promised appreciated we decided save chair older much trouble return hope bigger better chair child 
-1	i purchased give five month old somewhere sit beside bouncy seat underwhelmed quality construction the fabric course toy bar seems rather chintzy , although i normally remove toy bars daughter see 's going around anyway the seat also seems somewhat jerky rocked looks uncomfortable that said , 's not terrible i n't hate enough send back i submit review let potential buyers know quality n't given price tag 
-1	my husband i planned last pregnancy researched checked everything ! we given iglide mother baby shower gift it wonderful first 8 weeks ! my daughter slept swing glide every night next bed around 8 weeks , i noticed would stop working woke middle night i 'd put glide , check make sure lock place would half cycle shut it worked fine rock mode , glide kind issue my husband actually took time open check sensors anything visible fine i n't know happened , i really disappointed it also states goes 22lbs , i n't see happening my daughter currently 7 1/2 months little 18 pounds thing n't move well she n't able use several months due 's inability handle `` weight '' *sigh*i thought well research product tryout i guess i go generic one next time 
-1	i purchased item infant twins i read negative reviews several websites , thought experience would different i purchased swing time less expensive models sale plus , wanted swing could plugged , note : used cradle swing feature pros : attactive easy assemble following instructions lots sounds choices good volume control appreciate foot controls holding sleeping baby cons : after using swing 10 weeks longer swings properly we turn high barely moves it warm i not wait warm - several occasions waiting awakened baby last night stopped working completely woke fussy , teething baby we never used glide feature not smooth the music turns 20 minutes , wakes baby i would not recommend swing anybody we returning found fisher price little lamb swing $ 122 plus free shipping if purchase swing , please save box , instructions , etc 'll likely return 
-1	the positive thing i say swing color jungle theme super cute it always looked like baby uncomfortable if look product photos baby looks sort uncomfortable also it not support baby well i also not like swing settings ! the instructions state swings fast hang blanket slow ! i not recommend swing ! 
-1	we got gift could n't get together the blue fabric covered 'bar ' curved picture , stretched straight , even pulling far could make go , could n't get final leg inserted there like , much torque final 'leg ' get base clearly assembled backwards , warped something i sent back & ordered replacement , defective way junk i expected price we replaced jumperoo round base & straight legs-seems straightforward 
-1	upon receiving , i followed assembly directions explicitly made sure everything place correctly placing baby first time once started playing , i noticed stand seemed bit wobbly i took baby check base sure enough , stand clicked base , n't secure fit i feel the stand secured base something substantial , like screws , 's `` click in-click '' type assembly i suppose make easier disassemble , 's important bouncer safe convenient i returning amazon 
-1	the green ring hard rock n't make sound the purple ring n't make noise fisher price made another one rings make noise soft they green , orange , zebra striped buy one 
-1	go target , walmart babies r us its $ 30 ! i bought mine last month this way expensive 
-1	the vibrating works well chair really cute pull handle get 15 second music go pretty pathetic how many baby old enough pull music handle sitting vibrating chair ? none that motion pleasant little babies ca n't pull handle hear little tune 15 seconds it durable cute not worth money spend little extra get fancy chair know use babies i selling one buying better one ! 
-1	the underside tray ridges my son would get excited kick feet , causing redness bruising the underside tray mechanism nothing kid safe i buy something else i think issue may addressed new model theyve redesigned underside i think 
-1	we loved chair first using months come realize truth first , 's dangerous when not using tray part daughter gotten arms stuck rails ( tray attaches ) seat part multiple times while n't require medical attention , caused pain gave red arm upset point crying the last time arm got stuck stuck badly n't sure even going able get ! ! 2ndly , chair difficult clean keep clean i like pad , food constantly falling pad seat getting underneath may not realize 's anything weeks yuck one tip though , pad says handwashed , washed washing machine cold/gentle cycle , dried tumble dry low no issues the fabric held well oh , also , tray hard get chair worked like charm first bit wear tear i guess mechanism getting worn very regretful spent $ 65 chair i see 2012 model longer includes tray arms , least redesigned i still would n't buy though , i looking options 
-1	the purpose chair save space conventional chair would take , opinion , take away one regular chairs table & eat space normal high chair would 've gone once attached chair ( & i 've seen/used different types chairs ) wo n't slide table , defeating purpose not high chair the reclining option well , stupid babies n't learn eat reclined position unless physical delvelopmental delay requires little extra aid the `` bucket-seat '' style like carseat & restricts arm movement older babies also , idea cloth cover childs chair means clean , clean cover & underneath then tons cracks & crevices food get stuck in the tray huge , i yet find dishwasher fits in so 're looking actual space-saver , try one thefisher-price healthy care booster seat , green/blueoptions i bought one trial-and-errors using one nanny the tray fits nicely sink quick hand-wash or dishwasher , the seat simple , compact , & fits table it cleans nicely & folds need take a much better option ! 
-1	i bought 8 month old extremely narrow she barely fit way backrest without feeling crowded also table easily fix position i make stay 's maximum baby even crowded i recommended product 
-1	if n't care device looks like poorly manufacturer might aesthetically lacking , might good chair but i wanted bring attention poor construction , quality control product before purchasing , look user uploaded photographs clearly see eating tray in manufacturer photos , tray looks smooth , like would expect no crevices , smooth plastic surface baby eat now look user pictures , 'll start notice crevices lines go device - like dents - not subtle obvious enough noticeable picture in person , much worse so functionality may fine , i probably rate product 3 stars , amount positive review without single mention issue puzzling even users uploaded pictures see issue , n't even mention review maybe i higher expectations plastics made the crevices/dents directly related 's built underneath anywhere lines underneath , see crevices when i first got order , i figured i gotten defective product , since not mentioned so i got replacement the first thing i check tray , , exact issue the crevices , locations , directly linked manufacturing so i left wonder : bad batch ? are chairs like ? did i get two defective products row ? then i started looking pictures users uploaded i started seeing issues , i know 's widespread issue again - n't care looks , chair fine i n't seen poorly constructed plastic items loooong time if questions , purchased device n't crevices eating tray , let know comments thank 
-1	this looks great use it nice features , fatal mistake recline position who really eats reclined anyways unless 're newborn drinking milk ? the tray also huge ca n't throw dishwasher it 's even challenge wash sink unless removable faucet head i 'd go booster chair n't major flaws , costs less , portable used restuarants if 're looking complete list things add registry , visit website , allmomsareperfect com in baby gear essentials category 'll find stroller shopping guide , crib buying guide , comprehensive article need versus n't need ( especially 're minimalist ) there 's also articles expect hospital recovery get sleep postpartum 
-1	so , daughter slept mini crib room once started rolling arms legs would get stuck slats would wake crying since i another breathable baby full size bumper i loved , i sure i would love we measured crib ordered it did not fit ! it left 2 1/2 inch gap ! now i know reviews say people found way deal gap i returned ! i n't pay 2 1/2 inch gap ! 
-1	have mini crib tried put floppy n't seem like good idea choose not use sits bottom bin somewhere 
-1	this crib designed used several years moves crib toddler bed possibly back crib 2nd child however , contact manufacturer ask another copy instructions crib , tell i sent several emails even included photograph serial number sticker crib , company makes , afg , refused provide another copy instructions they rude unhelpful if want crib last years , chance might lose original instructions , i would recommend getting different crib different company 
-1	i got gift someone i embarrassed give the frame cheap material prints n't great either i found similar product discovery store way better it not worth money 
-1	the air dry clay impossible work no matter i ( warmed , kneaded etc ) wrinkly it also impossible get clay spread evenly neatly spaces little wooden dowel included i also buying plain wooden frames putting sculpey , 's not easier , 's lot cheaper results look lot better in picture part frame , plastic instead glass , mine scratched so much treasured keepsake ! 
-1	those super tiny cheap plastic plus way overpriced would n't buy ever and course not safe around young kids , easy break 
-1	i really wish i read reviews i bought thing but i n't it way rattle , 's way heavy baby , way heavy 's one year old , likely there actually rattle thing ( others mentioned ) although speaker holes back gorilla head , almost sound come unless shake hard , specific way i doubt kids get tiny squeaks thing , 's not fun try try get noise sounds nothing like giggle , quiet really use my husband thinks 's bright pretty told i n't return , i learned lesson , read reviews even `` simplest '' things i buy them it suggested `` teether '' `` teething toys '' tags i might want use there nothing baby would want use teether , `` rattles '' also suggested , part name toy badly mislead first place no giggles , rattles , not much toy 
-1	i thought i would see one , n't wasted time spend extra money get better one it constructed cheap materials , seams not complete 2 places sun shade not centered i returned refund ordered one one step ahead instead 
-1	i giving product 2 stars based personal experience i seen potty perform better kids i say girls vs boys i used many baby bjorn products past i good experience this product recommended friend ( girl ) i got ago even though boys ( twins ) not use potty time we recently star using potty boys would leak potty 8 10 times pee-pee would mainly outside floor i tired cleaning my friend girl not problem experience great potty not great boys girls the old version potty way better 
-1	i bought reviews name i never seen person i i would never bought i boy pee shield low when first bought refused use hung onto he 's set back potty training i decided take one try give try he used he peed all over the floor luckily i standing right help , shall i say-direct-him need go but late , peed front seat right i needed pick mean i either clean i empty well i empty i get pee hand this seat n't high seat like one i think cause lean back bigger chance accidents the non-skid bottom nice i n't know potty chairs n't not lid good-bad thing we extremely small bathroom means also need stool reach sink , lid would take care extra item small space however , lid one step child bouncing around trying not go the potty seat came unsealed , plain plastic bag amazon box , not come babybjorn potty chair box i could n't help wonder i received returned item 
-1	i purchased local target assembling discovered top bar not create arch pictured in fact , goes straight across appears not long enough not sturdy enough create arch kind i hoping able hang lightweight stimulating toys across top , toys right baby 's face not hanging high enough also one three parts make base not lie flat/flush ground , slightly ground put flat surface feels rickety finally mirror one sides slanted weird way baby 's face way close ( difficult way seat ) order him/her see reflection overall i n't think worth cost , i 'd rather try rainforest jumperoo looks sturdier base 
-1	not crazy spending grand stroller stokke nickel dime something comes standard strollers with cup holder installed challenging adjust angle handle bar lastly , stroller already nightmare break put car another piece take put back on i say get fabric cup holder uppababy even velcro adjustable one britax 
-1	i using tray almost year loved , started peel week i upset quality product peeling plastic not safe baby ingest we n't even use tray often ( maybe 's mine lasted almost year peeling ) product unsafe seller manufacturer would anything fix , replace refund i disappointed , expensive item unfortunately expensive piece garbage 
-1	i really dislike washing bottles i thought disposable bottles would give occasional break dreaded task but i wrong these disposable bottles not work several reasons 1 the leaked 2 my daughter , loves bottles , would not drink one it n't full either trying feed one , i tried normal bottle took milk without problem 3 they expensive $ 1 , really not want throw away one use but even wanted , way reuse one lid not come off i see instances might nice disposable bottle not enough justify cost waste bottles 
-1	i n't think i switching playtex dropins i using the re-sealable bags steribottles easy use help keep clean sterility bottles nipples ensured stacked , one top ( think dixi cup dispenser ) the bottles 8oz graduated the nipples fast flow the procedure unseal reseal bag get bottles straightforward , although probably not necessary once open bag longer sterile the need carefully partially unzip packaging nipples tedious the nipples leak little bottle inverted , feeding , flow fast ( fast , much faster playtex fast flow nipple ) the biggest surprise put nipple bottle , ca n't take i discovered testing empty waste bottle nipple this means ca n't `` top '' bottle , add something already made bottle forcing nipple bottle breaks sealing mechanism renders bottle useless the bottle recyclable , not reusable there lot less trash dropins i see reason switch 
-1	i n't purchase amazon i bought pharmacy trip our 6 mo old daughter not like bottle her formula pretty thick ( enfamil ar ) uses avent 's `` 3 '' nipple the flow bottle fast , nipple kept collapsing : -/ 
-1	despite negative reviews , i figured i would try 6 month old road trip if baby feed stiff , plastic nipples , might work we lucky brought two regular bottles us , case our 6 month old could not feed , not lack trying , either 
-1	they 're cute would anyone make burp cloth side 's non-absorbent ? the absorbent side n't that absorbent , either ! i use ship , cheap white cotton ones still go 
-1	they work , tiny ! the plain white side absorbent side really isnt they cute , made small babies 
-1	kinda useless whole head part silicone ( bristles ) surprised tiny ! i expecting something much larger half size hand baby enjoyed throwing around room everynow took half hearted attempt sucking/chewing we got toothbrushes actually bristles actually use brush teeth enjoys 
-1	bought 10-month-old 8 teeth 4 molars coming the brush soft bristles set pretty far apart , not like adult toothbrush the bristles like little massage bristles instead cleaning do n't like it 's kids n't many ( ) teeth if baby several teeth , go something else 
-1	one star mainly baby n't want anything normally , likes put everything mouth least plays she n't even want hold it 's waste money i ca n't even pass someone else 
-1	i got `` infant toothbrush '' son started teething really early i thought would easy handle shape fits awkward little hand but 's not biggest concern product , , always grow my biggest problem picks lint like crazy i wash every use matter seconds ( 's not exaggeration ) 's already full lint stuff it 's gross it seems like product made sticky kind silicone bummer , i really high hopes product for price i paid i expected much better quality 
-1	be sure assist little one , using product severe choking hazard product made flimsy plastic infant/toddler teeth little plastic brushes come right 
-1	i got i thought would add extra absorbency overnight diapering they n't proven useful overall i think 're pretty pointless my daughter 3 months old ( started using 2 months ) maybe come handy poop less runny ? they soft , cloth diapers/inserts n't need softer 
-1	i surprised i received mail- literally pieces thin fleece i 'm new cloth diapering i guess i expecting i could certainly gone craft store purchased fleece , cut pieces , much less ! 
-1	trying several liners find good ones not too thin not want do n't seem like 'd hold much returned 
-1	i know meant wick away moisture daughter 's bottom , still much thinner i expected now i washed several times , covered lint ; sometimes point bunched wash point , n't keep moisture away daughter 's bottom may well cut piece fleece store old fleece blanket laying around 
-1	i washed several times , tried use hemp doubler overnight within less hour 1 year old bed , soaked after water test see water beads doublers , fleece liners failed they not absorbing water collected & beaded surface so , liner cause diaper leaking soon urinated one time trying go sleep how many times wash effective ? i wish i could return they waste time , water & detergent wash , & money ! 
-1	these ok they job part size small , i think lots times lo poops , goes liner , diaper gets stained needs rinsing anyways also , expensive , could buy fabric craft store lot less lot liners custom cut preferred size i used plain flannel cut larger works really nicely although not `` stay dry '' 
-1	i really wished made larger size this size would great newborn , 's 
-1	these worthless cloth diapering the cream ointment soaks right i 'm currently looking better option 
-1	i loved idea reusable labels daughters bottles , uses , went downhill at first , really easy write name , i erased times , got harder harder write also , ink never fully came , i constantly writing smeared ink now i 'm using painters tape sharpie 's lot easier

-1	this changing pad arrived , reviewers mentioned , padding bunched regardless whether fabric organic not , i pretty sure foam included inside changing pad pretty toxic i emailed la baby never got response , i 'm assuming n't really want anyone know company meeting federal fire regulations foam if read carefully , description never mentions inside changing pad made if looking inexpensive changing pad free polybrominated fire retardants , pick serta organic contour pad listed mere 89 dollars amazon ( really ? ) , find popular chain stores 29 99 
-1	i searched amazon organic soft toy baby ended choosing bear it cute , kind stiff not really fun snuggly baby i think adults like babies 
-1	nowhere actual label attached toy say `` organic cotton '' what say , `` content consisting pla-polylactide fibers '' `` made china '' make conclusions whether not trust company 
-1	this seat arrived tear underneath & sort looked used weird i ordered previous one arrived new ( ! ) & really liked , although toddler not quite yet ready potty training i ordered second one upstairs ( prepared ) arrived torn & i hope not possibly used once i contacted amazon refunded immediately & addressing situation thank amazon ! too bad i really like seat , not order another company update : i ended returning original seat well it left large red marks legs hard time getting , sort sticks gets sunk bit amazon pulled ! i ended ordering mayfair 183ec 000 nextstep child/adult built-in potty seat lift-off hinges , elongated , white amazon absolutely love super easy use child adult , separate seat deal

-1	barely stayed month worthless busy return definitely late 
-1	it didnt work nither new born older kid it doesnt lean properly , position vertical younger kids for older kids , bucket not deep enough hold comfortably some never worked , looked nice assembling big miss if hard wood floors , vibrating metal frame could big annoyance but not issues carpet wish put little bit thought field study releasing product going back fisher price bouncers 
-1	it 's nice thick , length way short by time fit 3-6 month size ( neck/arms ) feet already sticking bottom- 's not weirdly long either , pretty proportionate despite daddy 's genes crazy height i prefer onesie feet , since size ( 6-12 month ) 's getting wear quite time ( course , 's 6 month age spread 3 months , know ) - point , 'd think gown would fit longer , since bottom elastic tighter side weirdly short , really never fits unless 've got short squat baby which cute , congratulations ! 
-1	the item cute , i purchased i sooo close returning i followed people 's reviews went size ( 3-6 months ) even though i 2 month old i 'm glad i , does fit , sleeves super wide comparison rest item yet somehow difficult put baby maybe i 'm used carters brands baby clothes seem slip easily baby 's head allow easy insertion arms etc struggle by time i got baby fussy like i said , i n't thrilled fit , arms huge comparison rest outfit my boyfriend came saw asked dressed son like `` monk ''

-1	i really wanted like stroller it reminded larger version snap 'n go , i loved however , i disappointed the ride okay i love storage console parents kids i originally ordered advertised & # 34 ; one-hand fold & # 34 ; i n't know something wrong item i received , almost impossible fold unfold it takes 10-15 minutes fiddling around , n't work baby need get i 've tried several times , thinking i must something wrong , i n't luck i 'm returning today 
-1	when i bought , i looking stroller reclining seat naps tray snacks other , i wanted something light , compact , easy operate i 've never used reclining seat rarely used tray 8 months i 've owned , i hate using the stroller takes half trunk honda civic , yet none sturdiness i would associate bigger stroller models it advertises able open close one hand , i find completely laughable it always takes two hands close , wheels aligned perfectly close the latch supposed keep stroller closed not snug fit , strolled never stays closed opening used okay , recently disaster for reason i discover , stroller not open way , even i use hands , i struggling parking lots least two minutes i get mechanism lock place i would never get 
-1	loved originally very light easy fold it n't seem like sturdy construction sure enough , stopped folding 2 month 's use it feels like 's stuck something , many attempts never located cause returned 
-1	could n't find table would attach i ended returning got cheap $ 20 booster chair target works great ! 
-1	i surprised older reviews not mention : spoons get stained food , impossible wash stains so i end using one orange foods ( carrot , sweet potato ) , one green foods ( broccoli , zucchini ) it makes wonder though whether bacteria get accumulated spoons 
-1	ok , i admit , i bought pretty and yes , pretty but , not useful so , though tempting , i n't recommend purchase the spoon big even bit deep small baby 's mouth we tried 4 , 6 7 months , n't really like they also stain so longer pretty , reason i bought them pros : - prettycons : - big small baby- deep small baby- stainbottom line : just enjoy looking pictures online instead go munchkins spoons beginning eaters 
-1	i bought spoon set , hoping silicone would gentle firsttime feeder unfortunately , spoon big deep save money , buy nuk/gerber spoon 
-1	it gathers play pen mat creating dangerous gap mat underneath soft area it 's waste money i 've stuck joovy 2 idea 
-1	i love aden anais muslin blankets - i n't get bibs they 're not absorbent number one requirement burp cloth/bib when daughter spits stain sits top cloth remains wet time i ca n't reuse cloth spot smears around whatever i 'm trying wipe for price i bought slew full cheap , prefolded diapers thick , super absorbent last several feedings granted far fashionable , basics first , aden & anais i 'll pass 
-1	they n't absorbent what else matters ? granted much cuter cloth diaper / works n't i pass 
-1	i went way register boutique versions a & a 's towels sets sold buy buy baby thin my daughter 5 weeks old i highly disappointed towels they leave white fuzz baby ! they not thick i would like although size thickness acceptable the positive i love washcloths we ordered bunch hide & sea la mer they cute i sad move another towel , especially considering much spent i plan buying regular towels baby use since towels grown ups house use thicker , softer not shed love blankets towels huge miss ! 
-1	i wanted try bathing baby , reading many good reviews soft the material not soft , fact , rough scratchy it irritate even skin , not mention son 's baby soft skin they also thick , ca n't really use get folds i think i 'm going send back

-1	super tight 3 month old cried every time tried put stretched leaving something wide tried self realized hear everything outside even small tv sounds i n't see named protector earmuffs we ca n't even use going movies baby it total wast want money back ! ! 
-1	some people rave fuzzy bnz i not like they ran small they snaps much smaller brands once baby around 9 months diapers seemed small even adjustments let they also leaked they worked well newborn not urinating much around 6 months fuzzy bunz could not left half hour they leaked around legs every time if poo 'd would leak legs 
-1	i excited get car seat i heard great things seems really safe secure the major problem i sits upright infant 's head always falls forward - really n't like sit it real shame everything else seat great i even purchased adapters car seat work stokke stroller i give 2 stars baby not happy , seems dangerous head , stylish seems safe case accident overall , i n't recommend 
-1	the reviews make thing sound awesome from experience , greater suction typical blue bulb requires much futzing around stuff -- something n't go well i 'm trying deal cleaning squirming baby 's nose i also purchased fairly expensive electronic nose sucker also pretty lackluster again , experience items pretty much , poor job standard nose sucker in area , i 'd recommend stickin basics 
-1	ok , nasal aspirator get snot here pros : ( 1 ) it gets majority snot helps baby breathe , especially `` can't-breathe '' type stuffy noses ( 2 ) i n't worry far nose put wonder working baby comfy nose fits entrance nostril allows see 's coming although squeamish ca n't bear look bodily secretions , probably stick bulb syringe my husband wo n't come near ( 3 ) it 's easy clean , unlike bulb syringe the bottom part snot collector , fits together like plastic easter egg , pulls open washed soap water the nozzle part also detatches cleaning ( 4 ) it frees hand hold baby 's head still but quite things bother product : ( 1 ) the snot wo n't stay snot collector ! ! as soon stop sucking , runny snot drip back , especially tilted ( example , baby laying squirming around ) that means tissue ready keep sucking ( even taking baby 's nose ) cover hole otherwise , snot baby 's face clothes this especially tricky ( ok , going get graphic ) get particularly long snot wo n't dislodge baby 's nose ca n't get tissue one hand holding snot collector hand holding baby 's head hand for , disgusting situation snot going everywhere ! you also careful put counter snot wo n't drip for , problem enough not recommend product but need reasons ( 2 ) i gotten thinking baby would n't fight much bulb syringe but , squirms cries hard ( 3 ) the tube connecting mouth piece snot collector , rather stiff twisted it gets way 're i hold hand holds snot collector baby biting mouth piece ( 4 ) i went instead nosefrieda review mesh bag , unfortunately looks kind cheap feels rough i prefer air dry bathroom counter return original plastic container , really sturdy ( 5 ) you might get sick using honestly , way nasal aspirator prevent germs spreading , even put piece tissue a friend suggested using antiseptic mouthwash afterwards kill germs mouth throat might worth try but i think even sponge `` filter '' nosefrieda not prevent spread flu virus there research says even face masks n't enough protect flu on hand , may not mind since baby 's snot going get his/her hands , sneezed coughed , snot rubbed chest all , baby comfy nose works quite issues make not much better regular bulb syringe i would interested knowing nosefrieda better 
-1	i tried using several times newborn little boogies , never worked the one get snot i pulled one edge q-tip sucked $ 14 dinky thing ? better spent anything else 
-1	this product sucks better using old-fashion aspirator get & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; hospital a pain clean air 
-1	i read hundreds hundreds reviews product , 99 % raving great it not great us now , i already spend first several weeks young son 's life using blue suction bulb hospital sends home , hated so probably already jaded nose suctioned but congested miserable , done after reading reviews babies love aspirator much better blue bulb , etc etc , i hopeful would make colds much better my husband i tried aspirator least 10 times , changing variables time we 'd hold one side closed suctioning side , 'd leave sides open , used humidifier night try suctioning morning , tried sitting steam shower bathroom suctioning , tried using saline drops first , tried not using saline first , tried everything could think make productive useful only i get small booger , already sitting inside nostrils he screams cries soon touch nose it 's not better blue bulb , sadly my son 2 months old tried , 's 3 months , give time frame old the item exactly described , perfect condition no problems it seems adequate quality , not i 'd hoped far baby reaction results 
-1	i never use product given sucking kids noses give infection so i returned product full refund found better alternative i purchased nasal aspirator connects vacuum cleaner hose so far working well my kids severe nasal drip throughout year contracted throat infections even bronchitis problem but aspirator i bought efficient ! it cleans easily i n't put health risk catching sickness the nasal aspirator i purchased called `` baby-vac '' product arianna 
-1	it worked well first , i even liked better nasal aspirators , maybe month using , tubing started smelling becoming moldy i throw away

-1	we installed 32 '' samsung july 2012 my husband said installation straight forward easy we happy product i 'm pretty sure stopped tv falling times in august 2013 moved new house went move tv found one plastic connectors snapped half strap longer connected back entertainment center needless say unimpressed looking another strap kit 
-1	i ordered strap assuming spot tv anchor but even though tv two years old , n't anchoring spot therefore , good idea check ordering 2 stars clearly specify product description 
-1	i originally loved crib not anymore big potential cause serious harm i think crib dangerous ! the metal spring frame ( set mattress ) moveable arms mattress tilt i found 3 month old smashed side rail tummy arms tucked he way rolling back due incline ( approx 10 degrees ) he 's able roll side ( flat surfaces , roll tummy back arms flat surfaces ) due incline- able roll way could not get back the problem ? he could totally stuck face ! ! ! ! i contacted company- sending replacement box spring without moveable arms makes wonder issue others well i not think infant alone caused tilt- i think pushing mattress & # 34 ; played & # 34 ; but imagine gets older stand/jump/weighs scary ! ! 
-1	this basically cheap , thin , tube top single ( non-adjustable ) row hooks middle i surprised receive learn n't come straps pictured what good bra without straps , especially bust larger usual bra needs hold added weight pumping equipment ? i inquired buying straps separately apparently n't even sell , picture misleading : shows woman wearing actual pumping bra underneath seller 's cheap tube top i idea positive reviews coming -- maybe seller 's friends family ? item definitely not worth money 
-1	i thought cute its not realistic comes trying pump regularly the nipple openings really close together n't fit ( i wear 38d ) i n't like clips together i prefer zipper faster getting 
-1	pros : the cherry fabric nice it 's easy wash , throw washer it 's also soft cons : once secured using hooks , forces breasts together ( creating lot cleavage ) importantly , making uncomfortable this lowered amount milk i could pump i would get lot milk i n't using bra also slits far sides it pushes breasts together manipulate breasts nipples pointed towards arms get aligned slits breast flanges go overall super uncomfortable i avoided using whenever i could the design not well done they need move slits closer middle also giving breasts room perhaps making product wider ? 
-1	i really looking forward device - i research pumping bra best thought would save lot time it works fine - stays place , holds medela pump style pump parts , folds easily pump bag but , i found annoying put item this n't bra - 's tube holds pump parts regular bra nursing tank top you take put time i take apart pump shield base thread parts holes carefully position parts fastening time - lots small clasps fastened holding pumping parts i pump 2-4 times day - i work part-time , i might different opinion i exclusively pumping but , part-time pumper , time saved n't justify trouble putting i also typically surf internet pumping , something i n't need two hands anyway ( i needed type pumping , , i might different opinion ) 
-1	i measured per provided guidelines band fit around but small height adequately provide enough support h/i boobs didnt really help hands free 
-1	i hated they third brand i tried while extremely soft , turn mesh baby 's bottom little pieces get stuck little guy less hour no thank ! 
-1	wow , worst liners 've ever used 've used imse vimse diaperaps ( favorite ) longer sold us , hence attempt finding suitable replacement best thing liner generous size yes , liners stick sides , cares ? ? hate liners n't cover entire diaper , esp since liners get bunched , thus providing less coverage easy poop removal liners n't wick moisture like cotton , need tuck anything in my kids n't issues stiffer brands ( imse vimse diaperaps ) , softness not matter initially thought softness would nice , turns liner disintegrates quickly pee gets change pee diapers , liners semi-dissolved - heck ratty liner supposed handle poop ? ? ? also , disintegration leaves linty residue child annoying well , maybe least disintegrate quickly plumbing btw , change often , i e never 2 hours , usually every 60-90 minutes also , unlike stiffer brands washed reused couple times , liners come dryer long wadded clothlike string not economical others hmm , maybe not good plumbing n't know i still n't found suitable liner , not use ever deserves 1-star , extra star size every liner cover entire diaper bit compensate inevitable bunching liners disintegrate quickly useless opinion 
-1	these seem like good idea , normally ended bunched daughter 's diaper i used day i got annoyed stopped using i never actually got see worked poopie diaper i 'll stick washing putting diaper pail 
-1	we tried 3 different brands liners these *least* favorite i bought i like liners already individual sheets ( vs roll like one g brands 've tried ) pros:1 ) soft bum 2 ) individual sheets dispenser box 3 ) flush easily 4 ) does n't result `` poo wedge '' crack like liners do 5 ) conforms diaper well cons:1 ) dispenser box always falling apart making mostly useless quite bit frustrating 2 ) liners thin rip taking box 3 ) each sheet folded lose convenience speed grabbing single liner 4 ) they stay wet peed - , far , bothered ; 's point stay-dry diaper go put liner stays soggy top ? ! ? 5 ) they thin rip/tear removing diaper - sometimes rendering mess help 6 ) if accidentally get put washing machine `` rope '' giant knot leave little shredded bits diapers 7 ) they one time use only other liners tossed wash peed - not would buying alot brands i 've tried do n't waste ( pun intended ) money there independent/small brand makes liners far superior , sold small website 
-1	purchased due many great reviews however , not product i would purchase these liners retain urine moisture instead wicking away baby i rather liners nicki 's diapers instead 
-1	we used grovia liners first , decided try ran cheaper pretty good reviews we hate ! they thin soft basically fall apart anything wet touches , change diapers frequently solid material actually broken middle liner weight thinness material changing dirty diapers become messy ordeal , supposed simplify i reordered grovia liners not finishing box 
-1	so , first impression bad liners , kept bunching making baby thong not catching anything using pre-fold cover when switched pocket diapers started working amazingly i lay way let edges lay side legs holds tight across diaper catches everything so i love i never tried others , i n't anything compare my son also largest size one size kawaii diapers cover almost whole way front back diaper 
-1	i tried cloth diapering could n't hack l loved covers i thought would help well i wong thin anything within even tried using 5+ liner still n't work , i resorted wetting using wipes still thin , waste money 100 % better using paper towels inserts 
-1	not i thought misleading information i thought disposable liners ( absorbs pee poop ) basically rice paper thin poop catcher instead liner absorbs i see purpose upset marketing said absorbing liners 
-1	the dispenser pack nice , liners tendency fold folding prefold wiggly baby n't leave enough hands constantly straighten diaper liner well if get place , job but , brands easier work economical well 
-1	i bought 8oz hexagonal glass bottles unlike silicone covers 4oz glass bottles , barely enough 'give ' pull 2 openings top bottles this results super taunt pulling around mouth bottle much like rubber band stretched max this resulted one side opening silicone cases breaking already anyway , i still use , essentially , side breaks , becomes completely useless if put bit silicone making larger glass bottle covers allow bit give pulling opening , totally great ! 
-1	these sleeves tight , hassle put i 'm also not sure would really help avoid breaks b/c little covered sleeve i prefer carry glass bottles one long neck bottle koozies they cheaper , effective , use beer baby finished bottles 
-1	i excited buy clock match daughter 's mural the clock arrived minute hand little loose , needed repairing work first place a hours hanging clock , block metal hanging loop fell , clock fell too i feel seriously ripped paying something started falling apart day i got 
-1	very short n't hold much weight ! ! also hook top not open n't work musical attachments very disappointed item ! 
-1	i convertible crib not find mobile attach this product clips side fine short useful even i altered mobile i planning attaching would within reach baby i sent back the way could use product would lowered crib mattress bent pick baby not good trade opinion 
-1	i hoping would clip onto side pack play every time i attached mobile would fall needless say i returned product 
-1	more fault anything , molding edge crib n't work clamp i hard time finding one ! 
-1	the concept great , i love fact not potential projectiile risks accident ( like suction cup sunshades ) however , not stay windshield , especially weather warmer 75 degrees i live southern california always sunny needed shade daughter sun hits back windshield certain time day they work well actually stay windshield , inevitably start peel , incredibly annoying what annoying also difficult apply onto windshield smooth fashion-there bubbles i ca n't avoid , unless anothe rperson helping , i n't see able attach thing without bubbles smoothing i wish would make clings windshield better , i guess 's price low you kinda get pay 
-1	this actually great idea , idiots packaged created ton creases obvious applied window make look like old window tinting 's coming if simply rolled sheet sold tube , would not problem aside major negative , great solution want able roll window shade you also cut shapes/sizes custom fit window based reviews , i think lot people n't know install correctly ( blame vague directions come box ) so i copying another reviewer 's tips installing similar product 's page if follow tips , breeze ( though n't expect creases go away ) : here 's 1 clean window remove dust lint 2 remove cling package avoid many finger prints also , try not place car seats anywhere pick dust/lint 3 spray light mist glass cleaner window 4 `` float '' cling wet surface get want it 5 using old credit card , work bubbles/liquid center cling towards edges be careful gently slowly card n't catch plastic make kink 6 use paper towels soak glass cleaner seeps edges 7 if stubborn areas , lift cling away glass , spray cleaner , repeat steps 5-6 
-1	they became malformed wonky first use closer inspection revealed & # 34 ; bath toys & # 34 ; come tag noting ca n't submerged water ridiculous 
-1	the packaging says & # 34 ; bath toy & # 34 ; actually take package look tag cleaning instructions , says not submerge water i could n't believe ! how get away labeling something bath toy ca n't submerged ? i 'm still using figure get uses i throw it 's bad daughter especially loves blue fish sponge i assume reason n't supposed submerge b/c ca n't really cleaned probably easy mold grow

-1	this play yard mattress cover joke it makes mattress safety first pack n play graco wayy small use even mattress velcro-ed bottom pull 3 inches gaps either end mattress i followed care instructions t i ca n't imagine working anything mini play yard co-sleeper i 'm disapointed b/c print adorable quality seems high 
-1	i wish i 'd closely read reviews sheet - cute i eagerly washed dried according instructions decided put graco pack n play right away welcome newborn home unfortunately sheet not even come close fitting how sad i 'm returning 
-1	this product small fit playard it also shrank dryer first , i use cover changing pad it works great not work intended purpose it made good quality fabric cute not fit playard i disappointed perfect color design son 's playard dice 
-1	i really loved look feel sheet , excited get washed onto daughter 's pack n play but unfortunately soon i went put , i disappointed it small standard graco pnp , try use bassinet , ca n't properly secure base crib sheet covers velcro it bunched mattress way felt extremely unsafe i returned immediately fortunate enough able even washing there warning package n't work graco system 
-1	piece junk dont bother graco version either their quilted sheet horrible quality fits slightly better though a complete joke not even close fitting pack n play- way too small i 'm not sure kind play yard intending a doll bed maybe i expected much better carter 's one star pattern cute , otherwise i would n't give stars

-1	the image gives impression 're getting quilted crib sheet no you get piece fabric/ pad is waterproof ? no cheap useless update : shrinks washer piles dryer 
-1	i particular keep item it not fit mattress slid around bad hard put sheet it i like giving honest reviews one main reason , money ! i ca n't afford buy things n't work seem cheap hold wash ! i n't want customers waste time money either i particular , spend wisely i can try j lamb products , much nicer lilyput 
-1	these crib pads help keep sheets dry wear quickly they looked awful first time i washed started falling apart 6 months i wash natural baby detergent hang dry i surprised worn already 
-1	i received pad , sounded good true , it is ! of course 100 % flannel would not waterproof there vinyl liner flannel layers so not 100 % cotton ! the box says `` fabric : 100 % cotton '' not mention anything plastic liner , entirely meant mislead here note manufacturer upon inquiry : `` if waterproof pad , vinyl liner middle , covered 100 % cotton cotton material coming contact child `` so outgas on another note , retailer grand gave refund item without hassle however , i reviewing item , not retailer 
-1	we purchased lap pads use bassinet sheet accidents they so small 'd use 3 really cover decent area even accident , material not absorbant , opinion we yet find use 
-1	these fine , super tiny stiff i prefer larger kushies covering changing pad these might ok travel otherwise , not sure would use 
-1	i ordered thinking would good use changing pad not change pad cover frequently as turns , using lap pad served purpose burp cloth cloth pre-fold diaper would they quite stiff not soft , even multiple washings i also think would better use slightly larger the product description accurate however 
-1	too small useful anything , unless child hamster an actual hamster i returned immediately 
-1	this would barely covered lap how i use baby 's butt whenever gets changed changing pad case accident it helps delay us wash kushies waterproof pad changing pad cover , much better job our baby tends lots accidents worked i guess i would never bought i realized small 
-1	i got registry , pre-washed middle section bunched horribly considerably affect absorbansy they nothing cheap prefold cloth diaper flannel binding added buy better quality prefolds use , flannel burp rags recieving blankets 
-1	these not really worth i purchased pack cloth diapers use burp cloths , less expensive hold much better 
-1	very disappointing - looked really good arrived i promptly threw wash they came looking like 5 year old rags go gerber cotton flannel burp cloths ; awful 
-1	these pure junk washed one time not faded , wrinkled like gauze/cheesecloth i using rags what waste money 
-1	we n't actually used yet one wash look like bought garage sale rather brand new they still feel like 'll quite absorbent middle although shrink bit i really disappointed brown polka-dotted one especially pilled looked ancient the swirl one held best i n't think 's worth getting pack one stands wash i 'll update actually baby get chance use : ) 
-1	i bought overnight diaper , trying avoid using synthetic fabrics , paired kissaluvs wool cover i even used joey bunz premium hemp insert i still leaks ! i re-lanolized cover make sure n't , tried this diaper absolutely soaked morning wetness goes right wool soaks son 's pajamas sheet i 've washed diaper joey bunz least six times continues leak i guess 's not absorbent my son three months old 14 pounds still not hold enough pee last 10 hours i expected absorbent guess i 'm going back pockets 
-1	i used son hours later i noticed raised red spots diaper area i love amazon letting return diaper spray obviously i would n't buy 'll continue make diaper spray since n't seem bother skin i wanted give try ingredients listed fact 's promoted something would aid keeping things like yeast away the smell also kind strong husband says `` smells like 's working '' i guess works i n't find smell off-putting rash sleepless night uncomfortable baby definitely deal breaker 
-1	this wipe solution good essential oils smells nice , way expensive ! you might well use disposable wipes , wo n't save money cloth wipes use solution like every time after i went bottle , i decided save money mixing solutions there lot recipes make , save lot $ $ , fill child 's individual needs i personally use tablespoon baby wash tablespoon coconut oil mixed 2 cups hot water this makes enough wipes last three days , costs barely anything the coconut oil helps heal prevent rashes wash cleanses the wipe solution wo n't either 
-1	i bought try cloth wipes i not like i made first batch threw away , i didnt even put wipes it way oily , i didnt want put kids ! i also didnt like smell i threw bottle away i think 's really matter preference , i went back using lil outlaw 's rump solution 
-1	these wipes started unraveling first wash without ever even used ! thin rough material not high quality very unhappy purchase 
-1	i tried using 97th percentile 4 month old still way big bulky i always knew would bulky , covers would n't fit sold weeks trying 
-1	this well made product , absorbent , volume bit turn-off 
-1	looking quality liner these n't best wish thicker held would not buy 
-1	i two , used cloth diapering daycare they wet bag zip compartment dry compartment they hold 4 all-in-one cloth diapers change clothes , problem at first i bit disappointed i expected bigger , perfect size day day transport daycare ( use large wet bags collect diapers home much prefer home ) i grew love used daily they 're washed dried every day wash cloth diapers the first bump road plastic snap holds handle together a snap broke one bags , replace this maybe 2 months use now 8 months use gaping holes outside fabric zipper ends rub fabric the seams threadbare , zippers becoming troublesome now experience looking pretty bad i 'm hoping limp little bit longer i 'll give this- waterproof bag inside still good shape holding , 's looking like i rebuild fabric bag around waterproof part ! for price ? find something else 'll wind disappointed a plain wet bag without dry compartment would better move purposes update : these ended lasting less 1 year cheap outer fabric zippers completely falling apart unsalvageable i replaced bummis fab wet bags- simpler sturdier construction bummis bags makes far sense use cloth diapering i would not spend money planet wise brand 
-1	it 's small ! ! ! barely fit four diapers i impression large ! quite annoyed 
-1	friends warned purchasing product , new mom , i n't listen i glad n't expensive , failed attempts use suction new baby 's nose , i tossed trash

-1	i n't understand marketed toddler/child pillow it 's way , way lofty , even adult there 's way used first toddler pillow even child 's pillow it might work travel pillow use car airplane i ca n't think sleep-related use it if 're looking toddler pillow ( kid 's used sleeping without pillow ) , tryclevamama clevafoam toddler pillow , cream it 's thinnest small pillow i 've found toddler ( 22 months old got ) took right away he 'd shown signs wanting pillow , using couch adults ' beds , took cue the problem clevamama pillow n't fit `` toddler '' pillowcases we ended putting width-wise king-size pillowcase tucking excess toddler mattress that 's actually pretty good solution forces pillow stay put bottom line : this small pillow way , way thick even side-sleeping toddler child use comfortably do n't waste time money it note for prospective parents : this one piece advice i wish i 'd known buying things advance first child 's delivery if 're like modern parents , 're going lot tiny beds different-sized mattresses , mattress pads , sheets you 're also going lot laundry these various sheets different sizes , hard tell come dryer you not want fighting sheets comes time remake bed vomit feces incident the solution choose one color sheets particular size stick for instance , get green crib sheets make co-sleeper sheets cream for pack 'n ' play ? all brown ( the brown hide travel smudges , ) buy white yellow toddler sheet sets also , get alaundry markerand write code size mattress pads ' labels people got fancy bedding sets ( , contain padded elements , dangerous infants ) ? you bought hype got kinds crazy sheets crib ? return or consign or give away seriously , unified color size sheet simplify life years come , especially one kid 
-1	this pillow bit firm i looking good size , little less filling would 've better my son 2 1/2 's hard find right size comfort size i need , pit poofy ! 
-1	this pillow sold toddler pillow it small pillow , perfect toddler sized bed , thick , impossible child lie comfortably head upon i use decorative pillow 
-1	i expected rubber-type material help hurting nipples- keep bra putting pressure sensitive nipples instead , hard plastic put much pressure breasts they uncomfortable the basic design good ( shape , size , fact catch leakage , etc ) hard plastic good ! 
-1	my nipples rather large for reference , i use 30mm flanges breast pump the holes product small nipples actually cause hurt , espeically plastic hard additionally , one venting hole , i kept getting condensation inside cup , seems conducive breeding bacteria 
-1	quality not thin scratchy spent get classic ones size smaller ugh 
-1	this 1 star simply description product the aden aden+anais brand lesser quality 3 inches shorter length width original aden+anais brand swaddle cloths there big difference i wanted make people aware 're not ordering : http : //www amazon com/aden-anais-muslin-swaddle-jungle/dp/b002sw3b0o/ref=sr_1_2 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1366406922 & sr=8-2 & keywords=aden+anais 
-1	these i thought would great idea since dont leak really dont however , my son 6 months old could not suck nipples they look nice cant eat , use i would not recommend 
-1	we using product son year i think 6th one bought ( get stained get little nicks cuts time ) we use hook high chair , handles , always perfect fit , one it super stiff definitely smaller regular ones i n't bother sending back since used i definitely disappointed 
-1	does n't unroll flat easily- really work we yet get stick table always falling the genius little food catcher sticks right toddler leans ; leaning causes food dump , less genius would not recommend product 
-1	i got eight-month-old since working baby-led weaning ( seebaby-led weaningfor information ) i n't love putting food directly table , especially eating as soon i put front , made job dislodge table the suction cups not match curiosity fearsome pull not wanting fight battle , i rolled put away `` later '' , time 'd interested eating sustenance exploring food surroundings that time never came at almost two half years old , 'd much better not dropping food , little pouch would invitation store food in quality-wise , 's fine it roll tuck pouch , cute , n't lay flat table even suction cups engaged and since n't work placemat , really n't matter easy store transport i n't return , i 'm also not going use younger brother ( eight months old ) i guess i 'll eventually donate goodwill bottom line : it 's fun babies play eat the suction cups ca n't withstand single-minded focus determined infant/toddler skip 
-1	i typically love summer infant products , dud i wooden kitchen table could not get suction cups stick , thus , mat moved place -- defeating purpose i even moistened suction cups stated manufacturer , still would not stay place i threw away got refund 
-1	i remember borrowing one friend first child worked fine when second child came along , i thought i would buy couple there problems newer version the material thinner flimsy it becomes quite folded dented before , thicker rubber rolled nicer also , suction cups tiny made flimsy material one suction cups n't work folded packing terribly `` crimped '' i smooth finished wood table pretty much kind table would see restaurant home the suction cups really hard time sticking , even wet i could barely touch would pop the top cup would n't stick popped pressure hard indented folds mat i would n't recommend mat it might worth trying glass table , otherwise , i 'd say save money 
-1	i bought two summer placemats thinking identical kiddopotamus product mistakenly left restaurant i wrong these far less sturdy kiddopotamus placemats , warp easily ( hot tap water ) , ca n't put dishwasher ( see `` warp easily '' ) much difficult adhere table others we 'll keep using backup , definitely inferior product spend extra bucks get kiddopotamus mat 
-1	we bought two 14-month-old twins use eat what waste money ! we used first time friday first , suction cups not stay securely place matter firmly pressed the top kept rolling our boys n't really mess first halfway meal , one easily pulled whole placemat table food placemat little `` trough '' went flying ! great idea theory ; i wish actually worked ! i gave two stars instead one *might* work better younger baby ( 6-9 months ) 
-1	i love summer bibs daughter started eating table seemed good choice problem , fold lines big suction cups underneath , n't lay flat this distracts daughter meals became placemat instead food also , ca n't use summer bib pocket bib bumps crumb-catcher placemat ( doesnt hang table edge well , either ) and could bigger just frustrating 
-1	leaks leaks leaks leaks leaks leaks i n't understand make stop leaking i read instructions , i read forums , i tried recommended tricks i hate bottle all leak 
-1	when i first tried use bottle , son screaming i quickly put bottle together i apparently wrong leaked everywhere when son n't screaming , i tried , found i put pieces wrong first time while i accept haste leaking fault , i felt strongly i n't want bottle required concentation put together then , using times , started leaking n't fault the reason i threw bottle , though , son getting terrible gas , worse brands i using their anti-colic system not work us we great success playtex ventaire , playtex drop-in 's , nuk tommee tippe ok born free i believe point tried every bottle market us , keep going back ones every baby different mam n't work us n't mean wo n't work someone else , even baby number two 
-1	the description says bottles come slow flow nipples , means level 1 nipples when i open package surprise level 2 nipples i need level 1 newborn , disappointment wait package arrive not want 
-1	i really wanted bottles work i trying find alternative playtex ventaire born free i twins 6 months old hold bottles i currently use playtex ventaire 6oz bottles these bottles not leak even hold upside neither breast milk formula escape bottle nipple now babes little older i need bigger bottles when held upside nipples leak my babies not feed without getting milk and/or formula faces big sigh and reason finding alternative brands ? my two year old stopped asking afternoon bottle i n't want think bringing ventaires meant and born free expensive , i placed order 
-1	i really excited use bottle , i wanted good anti-colic system n't require many parts dr brown bottles however , i ended abandoning similac simplysmart bottle here 's why:1 the cap impossible open i thought would loosen use , i could n't stand wait significant amount time i asked husband open one , almost instantly went get flat-topped screwdriver there bottle i 've tried problem , i find inexcusable this significant reason i hated bottle 2 there 1 ounce markings bottle , difficult newborns our baby required accurate monitoring much taking first due medical issues , i found frustrating not able see anything less 2 ounces 3 the bottle opaque , makes hard see line filling bottle markings checking see much baby drank this especially true night , i lighting low very annoying -- reason bottles clear 4 water leaks bottom i never real formula leak , water would somehow get trapped sealing ring bottom , i would get wet i shook bottle mix this would always make panic i placed incorrectly formula leaking i never sure n't formula , though , middle night i groggy 
-1	you look closely pictures familiar brand notice , bottles not anti-colic version the anti-colic version twist-off bottom another 'rubber ' valve allow air baby sucking food nipple with product page buildup negative pressure baby sucks , s/he stop eating let air occasionally i see another person commented nipple collapsing , i could see happening since nipple rather narrow much pressure could cause completely close even anti-colic valve though son stop let air nipple i question effectiveness i know product title also says 'colors may vary ' boy i hoping odds favor would n't get pink option of course got 1 3 i n't hoping , i 'm not knocking product since i knew beforehand ( 2 stars description totally wrong ) we 'll use pink bottles home get touch feminine side description totally wrong though do n't buy one unless n't care getting anti-colic valve

-1	there several things i like toothbrush , length handle , comfortable grip , bright colors however , every toothbrush 've used bristles fallen couple months use when first happened , i thought fluke i threw away second toothbrush pack ( mine multi-pack ) precaution purchased second toothbrush pack one after couple weeks , toothbrush lost another bristle head ! this clearly problem needs addressed , i longer feel safe cleaning baby 's teeth brushes company 
-1	dont waste money1- way small nursing mom2- stiff wo n't sit right bra3- itchy , rough uncomfortable4- n't absorb teaspoon need changei would give pads zero i could !

-1	i initially liked bottle warmer- simple design without lot bells whistles we used less two weeks bottom rusted leftover water bottom turned brown stinky use we ended returning using another brand 's bottle warmer ( the first years ) 
-1	i baby big plump cheeks , unfortunately pacifier leaves marks cheeks hard plastic curves bit 
-1	this holds two pacifiers really squish together hope container n't pop open n't really 'lock ' it 's cute convenient not worth money use plastic bag instead , make fabric ! 
-1	its bit challenge get 2 ( nuk brand ) i like easy clean part , holes allow air help stay ventilated wet but fall bag i 've dropped couple times put side pocket bag , easy find , defeats purpose hanging diaper bag strap 
-1	the reason i dislike pacifier grip handle stays hits son 's nose annoys , cries kinda defeats purpose pacifier - n't agitate ! 
-1	i totally agree previous reviewer our daughter loves nuk nipples & pacifiers , pain rear try find middle night heck , 're pain try find time - even drops middle day , pacifier falls red nuk face , literally blends whatever 's very frustrating go ones color

-1	did not like it really hard get liquid , even took valve waist money 
-1	i n't know faulty cup , 7-mo old not suck liquid i finally tried , i could barely get drop either no wonder son gets frustrated thing i still search good sippy cup 
-1	i baffled number good reviews the main problem handle base spin difficult open , especially child tends handle cup becomes slippery additionally , since handles turn , not aligned spout , means child holding handles spout facing entirely different way my child not able figure needed hold handle one hand , twist cup line spout line handle , drink it 's bizarre feature spinning makes things difficult like many , i tried virtually every cup market , hands , worst 
-1	i idea many people like crappy , cheaply made cuts the handles bottom cup spin around around cup , daughter never get steady grip the plastic thin seems cheap i found something better walmart , i loath place 
-1	my lo could n't figure use traditional , spill-proof sippy cups ( tried least 3 different brands ) we used occasional bottle 0-6 months ( not sure anything ) , ready introduce water diet using bottles traditional sippy cups teethers instead drinking ( yes , i even tried taking valve ) i found philips avent bpa free natural drinking cup , 9 ounces first years take toss cups work much better us i 'm sure great cup love gerber products ( especially spoons ! ) , unfortunately n't work us 
-1	these seriously best toddler flatware i 've able find , pricing ridiculous $ 19 99 go wally world bulls eye pick pack $ 4 00 hopefully , amazon com fix crazy pricing ! 
-1	ended investing silver spoons girl silver naturally antimicrobial silver leaches blood helping immune system the rubbery plastic spoons worked ok they wobbly hard use get food jars they ca n't hold much weight seemed unnatural 
-1	unless multiples plan carrying half nursery wherever go , diaper bag line duffel bag adult would use sports equipment ! it huge ! they list measurements someone listed stuff stash , actually see bag n't know massive it 's also kind ugly , really the design looks cute picture , 's brown , not black it looked really cheesy i got , went right back definitely big diaper bag !

-1	jj cole help less helpful many many fronts amazon returns awesome this second bag jj cole i zipper failure what great bag , terrible zipper i not ever buy jj cole 
-1	broken zipper upon arrivali truly hoping jj cole fixed issue seemed major problem product first released however , turns quality control regarding product these defaults major flaws , not small flaws could easily go unnoticed , inside zipper , inside seam the zipper would not unzip way when i finally get unzip , i noticed stitching also coming loose zipper & # 8217 ; aligned properly sewn together just poor product quality way around plus changing pad , nice seems , actually quite heavy compared changing pads come diaper bags i & # 8217 ; owned past imagine carrying diaper bag along everything else want shove & # 8230 ; heavy , heavy , heavier the hardware & # 8217 ; seem well made either i returning bag too bad i & # 8217 ; heed advice fellow amazon users said & # 8220 ; & # 8217 ; buy bag & # 8221 ; it & # 8217 ; really sad would even bother ship faulty/broken product first place amazon stop selling bag manufacturer fixes problems 
-1	we got diaper pail gift kid born it supposed if money issue i recommend system i however , would not buy the bags far expensive 30 bags cost $ 18 49 they hold `` '' 25 diapers per bag thats smallest diaper size my baby wears size 4 diapers he fill bag 2 days so , thats $ 18 49 worth bags every 2-3 weeks the pail work regular trash bags just cut plastic piece one bags fit regular trash bag its not ideal 
-1	the way thing works top twists shut lid closed prevent smell getting if bag 1/2 full , isnt enough bag left gather top twists shut & lid bends makes loud sound breaking i dont know way trying get spend filling bags 1/2 full i would buy something else i 
-1	it works like i never loved maybe i felt like i needed hands open push diaper narrow opening squeezing poop filled diapers scary way it odor free first months got rotten ! i replaced powder n't help room started stink i added air freshener n't help much i felt like i changing bag every two days i decided try small lid trash foot petal loving ! i know i probably need change every days far it hands free open , smell i need drop diaper , baby n't found yet , takes less room , uses grocery bags instead special bags cheaper pail wish i saved money went trash start it might work great lasted us year 
-1	this diaper pail really stinks , haha the lid n't close unless get arm wrestling match even close , loud the noise scares daughter the bags expensive the door n't close , seems like major health risk crawling baby plastic bag inside overall , definitely n't recommend 
-1	i high hopes product 's affiliation arm hammer disappointed 1 ) in order put diaper lift top hand ( reason i n't think even though first child i diaper dekor step open feature ) 2 when put diaper push top bag adding germyness ! 3 the biggest problem i made throw garage i 'd even finished using special bags lot times i could not get lid close i not know lever inside n't work would not allow close top i 'd open unit front , jiggle bag around , close front finally i could close lid 4 this not hold many diapers , feature may change pail sooner wo n't smell still , every day seemed excessive one baby time wearing newborn size 1 diapers ( compared diaper dekor ) so i ordering diaper genie elite watching reviews i would prefer diaper pail took regular bags seem none good marks smell factor wish i could get money back product ! 
-1	pros : bags close nicelycons : the lid difficult open one hand ( usually 's diaper hand ) also lid gets stuck try close , especially bag 1/2 full you push hard get close i 'm worried lid break ( cheap plastic starts bend ) also , take bags unit able fill way nice idea , manufacturing sucks it n't work 
-1	i could still smell poopy diapers pail i think every pail though so , i n't use pail anymore i bring diapers downstairs put garage asap 
-1	i would recommend strongest possible way one ever buy product the reviews product kind say descriptions all point product not work smoothly seem anything magically different , also seem give 3+ stars without comparing product anything else i compared product something else regular trash regular trash better and regular trash n't even lid a family friend also purchased thing exact complaints namely lid gets stuck , hunch shove diapers pail , buy replacement bags every month weeks in end thing waste money simply worse regular old trash detailed descriptions the munchkin:1 ) there major issues lid the lid supposed keep odors sprinkling tiny ( really tiny ) amount baking soda close initiating mechanical twist bag seal odors however , lid constantly fighting mechanics twist bag creating , starting bag gets half full , series sounds reminiscent small arms fire crack crack crack crack you live constant fear late night gun battle playing child 's room leading screaming sleepy cranky baby closing lid twists top part bag ring rubber shark-like teeth thereby closing bag well however , lid often simply get stuck open rubber teeth put much pressure mechanics lid this forces stick hand pail move bag around relieve pressure lid close think stick hand closure intended keep odors very often decide fixing lid picking grumpy baby 2 ) the rubber teeth pain often rubber teeth create much counter pressure closing lid entire process comes plastic cracking halt even lid works correctly still shove diaper rubber teeth you not drop diaper , instead jam teeth every time change diaper bend shove hand set rubber teeth two feet floor and two feet floor correct this thing barely comes kneecaps think even working 100 % correctly bend two feet jam fist partially set rubber teeth how better dropping diaper bucket ? 3 ) what 's deal bags ? i mean for serious ? a bag lasts maybe 4 days max like 48 hours munchkin wants fork whatever bucks month replacement bags ? i think entire reason mechanical twisting bags not keep smells the tops bags plastic ring set top pail snaps place the replacement bags 5-10 bucks box seems like real scam i tried two things a ) i wondered would happen i re-used one munchkin bags nothing bad happened i dumped diapers outside trash put bag back no smells , nastiness , nothing bad happened i used bag two weeks rather two days after two weeks us still smells b ) i decided try regular trash bag it worked fine you leave bit bag sticking beyond lid make sure rubber teeth n't pull thing completely pail close lid 4 ) the baking soda nothing a novel idea sure but , like twisting bags , seems like gimmick the level baking soda dropped bag close lid minor baking soda compartment totally closed i not see either much absorb odors alternatives : the alternative i used old plastic trash open bag lid i dropped diapers 5 days without emptying no smells whatsoever half time nice windows open the half time 90 degrees air conditioning in cases worked fine no smells conclusions : do not buy munchkin monstrosity every time use wonder lid close start making cracking noises struggles twist bag buy trashcan lid maybe one step lid and kid makes smelly one empty trash why would want keep stuff inside nursery anyway ? the munchkin gimmicky thing not worth it seems like great idea actuality thing not work ! 
-1	i 'm thinking pail used babies diapers # 4 anything bigger/heavier ca n't fill half way without lid putting fight close causes gears strip past close bag top we 'd love replace , looks like no one makes anything better we gave backing soda dispenser top , bought a & h ; pucks stuck bag this actually seems helped smell somewhat i 've gone far cleaning thing bleach i wish someone would make one metal if design made solid metal gearing would cost considerably , 'd last years good design idea , bad execution edit : ok someone emailed one made ubbi 's metal ! ! ! omg rocks ! so far ( 2 weeks ) room relatively poop smell free our son 20 months old man diapers smell not cheap , worth it ! check peeps ! 
-1	i used almost 3 months ok - gross `` squish '' factor putting dirty diapers i also disappointed use arm & hammer diaper pail refills - babies r us insert n't work i ended throwing away getting diaper genie ii learn mistakes - n't waste money ! 
-1	i returned item amazon n't tell item not microwaveable ( i say i n't go many user comments ) we going daycare , i n't want take chances i control working warming food going plus , item made china ( n't trust quality control ) while dishwasher safe , not microwaveable it n't make sense it better safe sorry 
-1	wow i really , really wanted like toy 4 month old daughter she giraffes bedding room loves look babble i though toy would perfect extension , taking box , sophie going right back first quality really dog- toy like it smells ! ! and paint already rubbing i n't care food-safe paint , i still n't want child ingesting it also squeaker dog- magnet we big siberian husky super diligent supervising around daughter i certainly n't want give toy going bring dog running every single time squeezes this preference- but good advise dog- cautious families 
-1	do n't plan kids actually able scoot around this also tipped we used play station without seat 
-1	i really wanted like since son seems like when first received , husband assembled told 's poor quality product well i still wanted like seat part son fell apart main station i thought something n't tightened properly i put together luckily son n't hurt then yesterday one leg fell apart son fell 's i wo n't use one anymore i found holes leg supposed smaller 2 screws attach seat obviously holes big if i return , i 'll return , 
-1	unfortunately , swing absolute waste money its cute music nice i really looking forward coming but not work us the cloth seat n't support 3 month old , fabric tight behind head leaves nowhere head rest , position sits makes chin tuck chest he looks uncomfortable not fall asleep i 've tried hard make adjustments , pillow behind back , behind head , butt , nothing corrects position seat puts he difficult time breathing chin tucked i 'm actually surprised would passed safety regulations ( perhaps not required pass tests ) i really wanted swing work 'm sad n't i would not recommend swing anyone also , i would returned return process , i learned i pay shipping costs ! my refund would i paid minus cost took ship item via amazon 's return shipping label ( approx 12 bucks ) would cost even use usps so i kept : ( major bummer 
-1	got gift daughter one mth old i started using 3mths old support head she liked hitting lion would always bounce back hit head made really hard plastic cut hated chair would n't stay 5 minutes 5 months used become turtle left mins came back see creeping wioh still strapped stopped using immediately 
-1	we received bouncer shower gift i thrilled simple design closely resembled `` old school '' bouncer seats i remember growing unfortunately son not enjoy seat i 'd say stays happy 2 minutes , max , 's i loop sassy brand rings along bar bat he young , may part - put away , i bring 's 3 months see enjoys it could age/personality issue case however , i also disappointed toy bar the toys short strings seems baby never able actually handle manipulate , bat the toys clearly designed teething , i n't see how baby could successfully get mouth ! what 's , one teethers water-filled - water-filled teethers usually meant chilled however , not detach teether chill fridge toys not detach bar also , main toy gigantic plastic lion nothing it n't rattle , jingle , light , play music , nothing just hangs what 's point ? ? i would n't recommend seat anyone , i wo n't keeping future children 
-1	i bought swing i wanted something portable i could easily move around room room upstairs cleaning , showering , etc i found thought looked perfect i wanted ! i could n't wrong it assembled quickly easily , seemed swing fine , however i put 11 lb baby swing , n't strong enough keep going ! ! when i took , swing sat , kind twitching this going back store tomorrow what waste time money ! 
-1	we chose swing relatively gender neutral color scheme fold-up option however , using couple days newborn , swing n't swing , jerked back forth , music sounded awful we exchanged amazon new one ( extremely easy process thank goodness ) while swing still swinging month later music n't work , actually ok ca n't stand music anyway daughter n't need content swing we n't fold store much thought would it potential falls bit short reliability side 
-1	our son hated swing- super difficult get swing strap without crying like crazy if n't strap seat shallow dangerous ( could roll ) i 'm sure great kids- not mine the actual swing good quality 
-1	i mom two owned several baby swings my kids needed swings get sleep infants - bad back ca n't rock child , swing need ! if looking portability great swing , keep mind no travel swing powerful full-size model we full size fisher price papasan ocean wonders swings , amazing plenty powerful - colicky babies prefer vigorous swinging soft rocking yes , eat batteries , cares child sleep 4 hours swing opposed 1 hour crib ! but i digress as travel swing : pros : much portable full size swingmore portable fisher price travel swing ( i ocean wonders model ) folds pretty flat travelno noise ( full-size models always click swinging ) decent battery life swingeasy assemblehas recline optiondecent music want ittimer want , leave swing constantlycute look babyeasy cleancons : '' speed '' settings really 1 speed - bother speed dial ? this seems typical swings though , travel full-sized will never move vigorously full-sized swing - top speed barely moving comparison full-sized swing if child used full-sized swing , swing might not move vigorously enough rock him/her sleep however , not used full-sized model one might fine a tip swings : use good batteries ( duracell ) get vigorous swinging swing the cheap ones , even energizers , barely move swing ! update : 1 big con swing i discovered last night - automatically shuts 1 hour , even without using timer feature i wanted run continuously like full-size swing would , wo n't why include timer 15 minute increments swing shuts 1 hour anyway ? my babies wake swing stops , exactly happened argh ! this makes swing fairly useless i want baby sleep swing night , wake every hour swing automatically shuts ! 
-1	i left review another bright starts product ( bright starts safari swing , dots spots ) i tried , starting one `` upgrading '' one hoping get better results useless say lo hated both the reclining positions awkward , straps uncomfortable , n't swing toy bar attached ( one issue customer service told bend , trick worked swing not one , sending new toy bar i doubt solve issue ) my lo hated i also n't care much music played never really used timer , lo lasted average 2 minutes never fell asleep , way would sleep i put already asleep - soon woke used start yelling i would not recommend swing - go bouncy chair instead n't much room regular size swing 
-1	i octoplush hanging octopus i bought i thought would similar octoplush able go along stroller rides it almost identical concept , differences make product huge letdown the legs not fun press pull string make music rather pressing head , daughter knows i think product blend octoplush baby einstein 's answer lamaze toy `` captain calamari , '' made like cc octoplush you 'd better figuring way attach octoplush stroller/carrier take along 
-1	my boy love octopus immediately introduced but sad say music part get spoilt pull thus playing without music 
-1	this wheeled board bit disappointment my son loves use stand , even , get stroller however , sticks far walk comfortably bee , even though 's meant bee so , walk little left right stroller , n't comfortable in addition , strings not hold board not use it falls right lastly , 's difficult access brake covers brake 
-1	it took forever dry -- 24 hours dry southwest it retains odors even serious washing i used cheap diaper pail target , i guess must meant disposables but i n't use liner , threw diapers diapers went wash , i sprayed inside windex multi-purpose cleaner vinegar ( seems neutralize ammonia ) wiped paper towel i n't really need diaper pail liner it 's expensive , unnecessary , still smells faintly pee poopy diapers despite not used months the plastic diaper pail never seem retain odors still fine used 2 babies 
-1	the washing instructions say wash cold water but dirty diapers washed hot water the initial cold rinse diapers n't use soap , order follow instructions , either wash separately ( icky handling ) , use soap rinse cycle ( waste ) , hope best wash hot water diapers anyway i chose last option i one bags , one another kind , using constantly four months ( one gets washed 2-3 times week ) the waterproof lining bag starting break multiple spots , one place hole ( small , still ) if i 'd written review month ago , i would given bag 4 5 stars -- 's big , solid construction , contains smell dirty diapers even using without diaper pail but expensive bag short amount time lasted , i 'd followed instructions would pain rear every time i used two years 
-1	i originally purchased 2 use diaper pails they fit pail wonderful cute ( second giraffes ) , 've 5 months elastic already fraying coming apart the pul seems fine , 'm not sure good wo n't stay pail elastic gives i really wish would enclose elastic protected wash maybe would hold better 
-1	i bought kissa 's pail liner i started cloth diapering year half ago for first months i liked equally , could n't really see difference but months wash wear ( i machine wash line dry , never put dryer ) , kissa 's antibacterial liner clearly winner the problem one , pul side , side repels water , reason always flips inward when washing pail liners , want turn bag inside pul side outside , otherwise 's impossible rinse soap residue pul side planet wise 's liner usually flips back tumbled washer i n't understand kissa 's seldom problem it might something elastic bag design now liner , i hand wash sink i take washer rinse foams knows dirty stuff bag 
-1	i loved bag i first got the outside material looks like leather actually made glossy , lightly textured thick material wipes clean without stains the inside thin umbrella-like material i loved accessories : pacifier holder , wallet , great oval shaped changing pad unfortunately , bag not practical it n't close completely top , narrow so bag falls , half things tumble the magnetic snap holds top `` closed '' inch wide , see everything inside bag yes , lets put stuff , bag full n't look nice in fact , i got bag thinking would big enough cloth diapers , holds 4 pocket diapers also , sticks lot back carry shoulders i store narrow aisles starte hearing things fall floor i went pick things , i stood , things fell ground i turned around see happened knocked things aargh ! ! i give two stars super changing pad , i quite disappointed functionality bag 
-1	initially i thought wonderful idea , i realized spare parts set three dollars less full set bottles included medela really needs sell collars alone lower price - wide-necked ones first thing break baby drops bottle i n't want pay $ 13 $ 16 dollars every time i need collars , 's ridiculous other brands use standard collars inexpensive comparison 
-1	i super excited get 15 month old i adore cloth diapering heard good things flats i unimpressed shrunk washing drying first time package ! i would not recommend my flower sack towels target work better they n't shrink 
-1	it arrived broken total waste time we also tried portable model it stopped working 2 weeks if i could i would give -5 stars models 
-1	it novelty light night light the bright color blue i like colors changing got annoying dim get bright dim get bright now i leave blue 
-1	this might work great car seats way use stroller because would take straps rethread openings attach

-1	i bought discovery 5 looked bigger it bigger , even lighter , hard snap base start you push front first back locks ( one i snapped right top base ) , 's quite hard line 're carrying heavy baby also , straps one adjusted front simple latch pull this one supposedly adjust behind , matter i do pull hard , pull light , pull buttons pushed , etc i not get straps budge i 've seat get stuck base front part snap locking whole thing it headache , i hate seat i 'm considering $ 60 wasted , i 've 2 weeks i ca n't stand anymore i 'm going find new seat 
-1	there hook foot base seat , makes feel dangerous get seat i leave seat care 
-1	i bought product 5 month old son looked really nice pictures son loves playing toys jumping when i received , set worked well maybe month son starting jumping one blue caps popped went , not safe baby older child around likes mess things curious pushing buttons my niece curious pushed , went easily i prefer something child proof also one springs came also playing , i noticed tore one paper labels chewing , i took away i think really fix stuff especially legging paper labels i think better buying something else expensive buying product baby could get hurt swallow one paper labels 
-1	too big car seat - works okay dangle swing does n't jitter pull point 
-1	i really wanted like cover , especially since expensive pros : - nice fabric- well made- holds well washing- love used high chairscon : - it n't fit shopping carts ( ex target , costco ) when i sold product , i told would fit , even costco double carts we pretty much use high chair cover now i recommend going different brand 
-1	this pillow not functional i add blankets baby prop could actually reach breast , i short waisted the boppy pillow much functional 
-1	i bought pillow one tallest ones i high-waisted person tiny baby the problem 's tall one side ( 6 '' ) side ( one closest body ) short ( 3 5 '' ) this means baby rolls pillow body , pushing way there way keep baby pillow this worst design pillow i tried , including boppy , trust , i tried ! 
-1	vinyl phased u s government due lack safety these items , including mattresses , mattress pad covers , old bath books made vinyl off-gas ( , leak toxic gases ) children breath i would not recommend product 
-1	my 8 month old son hated carrier , sadly we 'd high hopes based reviews but n't seem feel secure because way carrier positioned , able push back feet try stand , unpadded straps holding backpack would cut neck leave horrible marks we difficult time getting , clasp straps secure placed low carrier , carrier narrow , could n't see release buttons get we also diffult time stiff metal stand -- 's hard put kid ca n't get stand release behind ! finally , lack type chest waist strap big problem ergonomic perspective , kid 17lbs i ca n't imagine much heavier one there it arrived yesterday , returned morning you get pay , i guess 
-1	we bought lock local store this toilet lock stock bought it pros : keeps lid closed my daughter n't figured open lid yet easy install sanitary , touching toilet parts cons : not type toilet our tank curved bottom rather squarish bottom this made swing-arm get stuck tank every time opened it pops every single time toilet seat closed i tried different , stronger tape nope still pops the way i get lid shut without popping manually move swing-arm back place i 'm shopping new toilet lock today pretty mad i wasted money thing 
-1	this not work us the mount not stick well 10 month old could easily pull whole thing toilet we found easier diligent closing door 
-1	thanks certain airline shall remain nameless , canopy kolcraft tour sport umbrella stroller ( lightweight stroller ) lost east coast trip a big floppy hat solution i spotted replacement , turned bit bust although 's nice big , create conestoga-wagon-like tunnel shade attached stroller , 's really meant extend existing canopy , substitute one , size shape it array velcro tie straps sort every time , deal fold stroller , way really make shade boy tie side bars stroller , encroaching already pretty limited space these ties rather floppy ( albeit framed ) construction canopy magnets curious little fingers , boy constantly pulling something bending ducking , sitting , rolling , etc it makes keeping shaded rather challenge this thing , basically , good concept not quite adequately executed , 're looking replacement canopy not extension 
-1	i originally ordered rayshade larger stroller , i thought i could get one i could easily switch compact stroller turns i 'd always forget switch , baby left without shade the rayshade awesome , stretch cover everything , including feet since live houston , pants/socks not viable options summer , large stroller shade necessary i ordered sunshine kids shade maker cheaper , i thought , `` how different ? ? '' well 1 it small even tiny compact stroller ( the first years jet ) , n't provide inches extra shade it 's larger shade stroller comes and stroller must shade already work ( provides support ) 2 it actually hard put i mean , 'd think looks easy , i compare rayshade , 's ridiculous where supposed tie little straps not intuitive all 3 did i mention provides little extra shade ? ? the positive thing i say shade looks like 's good quality pockets side if want extra pockets , 's want otherwise spend extra $ 5 order rayshade uv protective stroller shade improves sun protection strollers , joggers prams black 
-1	horrible ! ! ! it ripped seams first time tried use disappointing ! manito sun shade perfect tho 
-1	there 's many things i liked stroller ( size , color options , 5 point harness , parent console , etc ) , ultimately i ca n't stand stroller if i turn stroller ( seems reasonable ) , front wheels drag they get stuck , i 'm basically pushing stuck wheels across floor it 's impossible steer , period let alone one hand , often need i wish i n't bought stroller i pushed around cheapo umbrella stroller day easy steer i probably get $ 20 stroller rip parent console one somehow attach cheapo one 
-1	first , stroller not recline inch the canopy super small useless the good thing light cheap 
-1	do n't recommend product -- expensive , basic umbrella stroller while lightweight , canopy joke -- way small provide sun protection granddaughter n't recline there lot better strollers keep looking ! ! ! 
-1	i loved 'extras ' stroller ( reclines , padded , extra room , canopy , taller , 5 pt harness , etc ) unfortunately came damaged the canopy bent curved left , one wheels broken piece inside , resulting annoying sound wheel turned not fun they however , sending new one free return shipping hopefully 2nd one fully functional if , i 'm sure 's great stroller 
-1	i send stroller back , major problems i it firsts 7 month old son fills sit 28 inches tall 19 lb secondly sun shade joke ! does n't give much protection i adjust front falls i also purchased additional shade , goes third flow- ok push stroller , i 5'6 '' my husband 5'11 '' hits back wheels every step takes , not spaced far enough apart ( seriously- 8 3/4 '' space back wheels ) overall stroller seems durable , i better spend money go something use 
-1	i see i not reviewer problem i excited first took stroller package print great , height handles little better umbrella strollers , canopy nice little zipper storage bag basket big enough small diaper bag however , i took outside , front wheels immediately started shaking every feet i could n't cross street became dangerous stop middle i tried flat indoor floors mall still shook i sent email company 's customer service not responded i calling tomorrow wo n't replace wheels , i sending back amazon never buy anything first years 
-1	reviews great i bought waste money does n't recline enough even call & # 34 ; reclining & # 34 ; stroller feels super cheap rickety very bumpy ride my daughter could n't begin nap - naps anywhere regret purchase spend extra money get uppababy g-lite something wish i

( course another 4 dollars tho ! ) anyway the canopy tiny ! it n't matter 1 year old forward facing , rear facing , reclined , sitting , etc the sun hit face directly ! i took fair i walking front wheel fell ! i set stroller according directions apparently piece either missing comes assembled front wheel ( clip keeps wheel ) came ( thats case way easy fall ) , regardless i could n't use stroller point way keep wheel ! it cute stroller honestly even tho inexpensive not even worth price ! 
-1	i hours research strollers contemplating first years indigo thebumbleride flyer reversible handle stroller 7 '' wheels , seagrass i finally settled indigo stroller price right features i wanted i purchased stroller matchingthe first years via infant car seat , abstract o'scar seat my son born winter i n't use indigo stroller regularly two months ago for first week , stroller wonderful what i initially liked stroller i could easily attach matching first years via car seat in addition , ride smooth , quiet , comfy the stroller breeze fold then , two weeks regular use , i started notice quality stroller diminish quickly here started happen : ( 1 ) squeaky wheels the wheels started squeaking terribly i 'd oil within days stroller squeaking ! i 'd store people would turn heads see annoyingly loud stroller ( 2 ) via car seat would get caught this really bothered i could live squeaking , i could not my son 6 months old still use infant car seat regularly one day car seat began get stuck inside left car seat stroller locking mechanism we thought maybe son 's weight causing problem , took car seat tried no luck ! we still could n't get car seat after fidgeting stroller car seat nearly 30minutes , finally got car seat unstuck ! to test things see whether not stroller car seat causing problem , decided attached seat came stroller that would get stuck wrestled around miraculously came unstuck unfortunately , stroller returned ( thank goodness amazon 's 365 day return policy baby items ) as much i liked features , i could n't put defective qualities perhaps i received defective stroller and car seat i find really hard believe in addition defective , else i n't like stroller ( 1 ) bulky i knew i purchased stroller would standard size stroller i still feel unnecessarily bulky in order fold , remove seat fold frame before i son i n't think big deal now i know better i 'd recommend find one piece fold-up stroller like bumbleride flyer ( 2 ) no cupholders there cup holders child adult using stroller at time i purchased stroller , also accessories available could attach stroller i think huge oversight ( 3 ) seat had to be removed i really found annoying i remove seat order collapse stroller switch stroller back forward facing as i said earlier , i initially thought frivolous disadvantage i think otherwise other strollers back forward facing option allow simply switch direction handles without remove seat if first years ever redesigns stroller , include option redesign even though i decided return stroller , still qualities i liked stroller here i liked : ( 1 ) back and forward facing i loved i could face son towards infant away gets old enough wanted explore ( 2 ) easy to collapse although stroller bulky , stroller still breeze collapse ( 3 ) european styling in addition practicality , i looking european styled stroller this affordable stroller also stylish after i returned first years indigo stroller , i went ahead purchased thebumbleride flyer reversible handle stroller 7 '' wheels , seagrass i update review near future comparison two i get use thebumbleride flyer reversible handle stroller 7 '' wheels , seagrass if afford splurge bumbleride flyer , i would highly recommend

-1	update : i bought stroller originally gave 5 stars , using 5 months much dissatisfied quality comfort problems encountered:1 i buy mattress ( found one buybuybaby ) make comfortable newborn bassinet mode bassinet mode , stroller tends tilt head use towels head heavy object feet level out 2 never able fold stroller base , never issue since suv , fits fine 3 still using mainly car seat , baby comfy car seat , put stroller sitted reclined seems , uncomfortable tolerated 15 min ( stay car seat hours ) 4 five months use light grocery shopping , basket stretched even light objects placed , touches ground , carry groceries hands shop ! 5 straps not comfortable , especially using bundle keep baby warm 6 diaper bag issue became apparent switched car seat stroller base , since basket barely accessible small , strapped diaper bag handle worked fine car seat , actual stroller seat , diaper bag ends sitting top babies feet carry , i would not buy ! i looking different stroller , since son ready sit needs comfortable stroller daily walks pros : large canopycan face ways 
-1	i excited get stroller wonderful reviews much less expensive strollers i looking what sold stroller fact seat position could changed child still seat when i got , simple put together it looked nice i put son seemed comfortable but i went change seat position it not lock place i went push stroller seat kept spinning i took looked seat see something wrong it locked i put back tried it n't lock it would lock weight seat my son 16 lbs ( well weight limit ) so main reason i purchased stroller not even work ! then week later i took stroller grocery store when i went put back car , would not fold i call friend come get stroller take home van way would fit car open aside issues ( i obviously got bad one ) , i issues stroller the basket medium size basket impossible access there bar bottom stroller gets way trying put diaper bag also , ca n't attach cup holder seat change seat positions , cup holder turn upside- down ultimatly , i spent money stroller i ca n't use i sent back yesterday i ordering britax b-ready instead 
-1	ruined whole load baby clothes brown trim bled everywhere great cover careful colors 
-1	protective cover ? ? my son leaked side diaper i immediately cleaned boppy , time i even got first cover and `` protective '' cover , poo leaked both boppy pillow how called `` protective '' `` water resistant '' things leak within seconds ! ? ? super soft cover loved idea prior event ! ! 
-1	this cover not water protective least i disappointed had minor spill wash boppy not good 
-1	i hoping would help protect boppy pillow n't my baby spits lot goes right protector it 's water resistant not waterproof help 
-1	i 've heard lot good things pillow i wanted inflatable travel version bc 's portability it took longer i expected inflate , hole ! was n't able properly test bc hole i returned in meantime , i also purchased regular version ( not amazon ) it 's stable solid , far , i really like 
-1	used total 2 times ( time used week travelling ) basically used 2 weeks ( not 2 weeks straight space 2 months usage ) after many months not used ( carefully packed zippered bag came ) , i discovered small hole along one seams tried using repair kit came ; n't work contacting zenoff products see anything it two stars ( rather one star ) since working , great ! my baby slept hours plane really comfy saved arm getting sore since i could put pillow however , i feel waste money since lifespan 2 weeks boppy travel pillow seems like better product 
-1	i really wanted love bottle there n't ton choices stainless steel , cutest options i 've seen the bottle okay -- could better , gets job done but - the paint chipped pretty quickly/easily , i found green flecks baby 's lips ! ! ! so go bottle , i highly suggest getting plain silver finish instead fun colors - the nipple ring sliced hand open if look closely ring picture , see bottom edge curls inward well , n't curl inward enough , inside edge kind sharp i screwed little tight , sliced hand open trying unscrew now , i exerting lot pressure ( far baby would able ) , i n't think 's dangerous kiddos , i 'm lot cautious i put thing together now - the volume markings could better since ca n't see bottles like glass , not every ounce marked inside makes filling guessing game the 5oz bottle , example , markings 2 3 oz that said , lot stainless steel bottles n't any markings , 's better nothing - the nipples/spouts wicked fast the level 1 came bottle comparable level 3 nipples brands i tried the sippy-cup transition spout not sippy cup -- 's soft ( pliable silicone nipple ) spout shaped like sippy cup both sippy spout level 1 nipples drip ( quickly steadily ) without suction whatsoever my daughter ( 8 months ) wo n't touch sippy spout the sizing standard ( wide-mouth ) , 's easy buy replacement parts ? ? - the cap soft , fold-on/peel-off deal pretty annoying , difficult put , gets dirty easily i 'd much prefer cap rigid ( stays keeps nipple spout leaking ) snaps on/off kleen kanteen manages , i n't know pura can't all , good bottle avoid painted finishes , replace nipple/spout another brand , careful sharp edge ring , n't mind not decent lid seems like lot trouble go price , though 
-1	if want 15m old walk around house create milk puddles everywhere bottle ! i 've never bottle/sippy leak sooo bad we 've always klean kanteen family i 'm going stick bottles mam nipple the thing pura bottle going cool factor , forget silicone grip covers , impossible get ! 
-1	within first minute use , baby chipping paint outside bottle teeth perhaps company hangs hat non-toxic , plastic-free claims consider market not use paint end baby 's mouth 
-1	wish i would n't purchased it hard set i never really knew i could trust work , i really n't get rest i wanted maybe work better baby number 2 
-1	unlike daughter , son tummy sleeper - agonizing fact 's not back , i thought 'd get sense security i least monitor breathing 's asleep - well , sensor n't pick breathing clipped back side diaper save money 're buying monitor tummy sleeper 
-1	i bought seat use one year old i planning using rear facing least two first , installation ridiculously complicated the instructions not helpful took husband ( engineer ) two hours put vehicle he installed using seatbelt car not equipped latch system frustrating , not planning moving place long seat functioned okay would kept we tested realized nearly impossible adjust straps rear facing position release far car 's seat to make things worse , tried adjust straps kept uneven either side we finally gave time much work every time use seat we another brand convertible carseat vehicle not nearly complicated we decided return seat 
-1	i three lamaze toys ( firefly , lion , peacock ) least favorite two main reasons : -poor quality within 2 months stitch holding hammer fell apart ( zero play , baby looking not even grabbing toy yet ) , 7 months entire seam along back broke open the first incident annoying , second unacceptable when seam broke , stuffing came could easily choking hazard i contacted lamaze , second break shows n't isolated incident , something construction beaver wrong -not engaging lamaze toys earlier babies it usual lamaze additions ( mirror , rattle , squeaker ) way placed beaver boring the baby ca n't really grab bat things easily ( compared firefly lion ) i think toy suited older babies/toddlers , 2year old i watching engaged beaver texture fur ! 
-1	i hoping would get attention son unfortunately not fascinated not worth price , imho 
-1	i like son he 9 months i got , 10 months , never showed much interest he likes book toys , peekaboo lamaze favorite ! 
-1	this two sides switch product different side baby gets bored however , hung lo 's crib , one side picture facing correctly ( contrast colors side ) when i hang side exposed , pictures upside the way would work i tied crib item laying flat crib mattress , safety hazard i 'm not impressed they flipped pictures added ties sides could hung properly 
-1	this n't great i thought going sadly i n't understand amazon offer 2 day shipping , i find something comes china if i would known coming china i would n't purchased the toy arrived strange smell i need air febreeze i give child 
-1	if using dr brown 's long bottles , not sterilizer and bottles , really patient work adjustable middle racks this thing frustrates end , i ca n't wait get another one this baby shower gift 
-1	i bought whim trip babies r us without reading reviews first-mistake ! it $ 40 , i thought expensive , also warms baby food jars i decided would able use long-term -- wrong first , settings type bottle whether 's room temp , frozen , etc totally inaccurate we tinkered settings weeks finally find set worked 8 oz refrigerated formula glass bottles the settings ? wide neck , frozen breastmilk even , sometimes reheat several times other times , hot after cracking 3 glass bottles , returned i later read reviews bru indicated melted plastic bottles well this warmer total miss waste $ $ we happily using old-fashioned pan hot water 
-1	i n't really research first i i wanted different warmer available store i liked reservoir flexible options it worked really well 2 months then started leaking tell electronics getting wet beeping sounding funny we scared use now pro 's flexible , water reservoir pluscon 's leaks , loud beeping 
-1	to tell truth , i thought `` gear shift '' side makes sound would great incentive son use potty when would go could `` flush '' potty make car sounds that never happened , became toy long decided go potty it would leak no matter , sit , stand , whatever would get gray seat , go along top bowl insert , ultimately end pooling floor the lid broke ended putting lid potty catch urine would leak i could wash instead whole bathroom floor day long it also made taller easier son sit as step stool son daughter use time get sink wash hands it fit great adult toilet it locked tight i n't worry coming son got big potty i gave two star leaking problem i went got munchkin arm hammer potty little girl , though n't gone potty yet , looking design i wish i gotten instead son training i would saved money another potty cleaner i use cleaning leaks 
-1	i think potty cute my daughter excited get home start using i noticed goes lot urine floor i not sure leaking top rim everytime uses i mop floor the sad thing one likes i afraid get another one loves princesses very disappointed 
-1	received toy story version trainer in-laws although daughter likes pushing lever & # 34 ; flush & # 34 ; , rest awful it 's awkward get thing open lid -- entire insert comes lid ( us adults ) not need time dexterity not side also , need lift rubber rim get receptacle leaves lot desired also not easy pour expelled waste receptacle toilet without adding liquid -- challenge two year old declares & # 34 ; i help ! & # 34 ; and proceeds stick hands urine also , lever major distraction toilet -- true , want fun , reward stickers m & m better child jumping mid-session hear clapping get something simple less pieces it 's not even sturdy enough step stool child 25 pounds ( 30lbs ) get something cheaper investing gimmicky disney product 
-1	we bought chair local store handle plays music , pulled , stop playing music within two days purchase we changed batteries came see made difference it n't going take back store since n't `` used '' 
-1	i 3 year old girl loves minnie pink she loves potty i hate everytime pees , leaks so not i dump potty clean , i clean floor so disappointing she loves noise makes potty it great potential the fact turns stool nice it 's basically $ 20 stool 
-1	let start pros : - strudy- seat soft- easy clean- great foot stool- my son loves designwith pros would think i would give 2 stars this potty not boys i know geared toward boys , splash gard n't even come close covering when son sits nothing is covered because nothing covered point potty i would not suggest anyone buy seat 
-1	we girly edition i hate the padded ring issues flops around making total leaker ! and sat long darn thing comes childs bottom ( gets stuck child ) again making huge mess the lid falls constantly its rather short stature not made taller toddlers learning use potty we found fisher price $ 12 potty huge hit much easier use ! ! 
-1	this digital monitor great idea , unfortunately execution idea needs improvement like many others gave monitor low starred reviewed , i problems reception sometimes poor i idea going baby room the receiving end ( monitor ) often lot static blank moments reception there times i could hear baby crying doorway room i receiver located , receiver barely seemed pick cries baby 's monitor located right next crib totally unacceptable i like design n't mind bright light led , fact unit unreliable monitor makes one star if baby started choke i would unable hear warning signs receiver static mode blanking 
-1	this baby monitor digital automatic frequency selection because feature , sound continually skipping cutting as monitor searching best frequency , loses connection transmitter , making monitor unreliable during testing heard loud beeping sound , perhaps another result auto frequency finder in middle night would rather awoken crying baby high-pitched beep this baby monitor also tends transmit subtle sounds not baby sounds , seems negate point monitor first place after 1 night testing , done do n't waste time money 
-1	we registered monitor , got first shower thankfully , i set tested throwing box , horrible ! the reception n't clear , volume really low i returned got another one slightly higher price-point the difference unbelievable ! it 's definetly worth little extra money monitor allows actually hear 's going nursery ! 
-1	i got one cheaper model i n't need much hear baby woke he 's pretty much alarm clock days i 'd rather spend twice price better monitor cons : * it crackles simplest things , like cats walk past * it makes popping noise every 20-30 minutes hour i terrible insomnia wakes i finally start drifting sleep * it constant static it 's higher pitched white noise soft , fast clicking beeping background i need put pillow head turn monitor way i hear crying without static * the clip weak falls belt loops the 'stand ' far useless * the batteries die quickly * the light monitor blinks bothers son i parent unit turned ( when cries , i check let fall back sleep 's not really awake i turn monitor 5 minutes turn 's back sleep no mute button ) * the light constantly lit parent unit not turn unless i turn monitor i 've placed floor , slightly bed n't bother * it randomly shuts , sometimes accompanied loud , long beep/buzz scares heck everyone pros : * the buttons nice ca n't accidentally press * the adapters work primary power source * you hear baby cry static sounds picks ; like dryer , lawnmower , cats relieving shower running - turn way * i ca n't hear neighbors monitors i live semi-crowded community town houses full babies children electronics overall : good theory simple , effective , affordable not insomnia stricken unless like choppy white noise random popping sounds lull sleep we replaced two-way version exactly 
-1	i really taken previous reviews heart ordering piece rubbish rubbish ? well starters ca n't count working ( not exactly something want say monitor ) , work , poor job end getting headache trying hear soft volume overwhelming array static it 's worse drive speaker 80s you get reprieve , stops working altogether offers silence , kinda defeats purpose ! then 's loud beeping sound , least covered cursing unit anyway , favor look elsewhere ! 
-1	it looks like good idea , nice size , good specs , etc thing piece junk ! even 10 feet base constantly clicks pops randomly beeps also i able hear baby crying hall could n't hear monitor 
-1	i bought $ 23 50 , thank goodness i n't spend penny ! i hate monitor after using months , i went back using 8-year old trusty ol ' fisher price old-school analog model pros : -inexpensive ( i bought ) -two-way walkie talkie feature useful older kids-two parent monitorscons : -horrible reception ( cuts , notice mostly baby crying loudly ) , one parent units randomly turns off-connection drops frequently , even though monitors placed quite close base often turn parent unit & back discover kid actually awake , even though indication unit n't receiving signal -incessant beeping & clicking picture : middle night parents already suffering lack sleep units start beeping apparent reason daddy starts swearing mommy rushes quiet now-awakened baby not good -volume setting way quiet thank goodness son n't fussy baby , many times i 'll walk past room hear awake , even though i could n't hear thing monitor -range terrible house ( split level ) - ca n't take parent units downstairs garage , neither far child unit not useful all do n't just , n't 
-1	i originally reviewed product 1 year ago , `` we love first years true choice digital monitor we 2 parent units easily clip-on clothes portability rest next bed the audio loud clear ; intercom unit nice communicate parents parent child : `` elianna , 's time go night , night lay back '' we get crystal clear reception everywhere home battery life ( included rechargables ) great 8 hours parent units child unit stays plugged in the fatal flaw units child base unit bright blue light literally lights daughters room keeps awake this would fine i guess child sleeps night light our daughter likes pitch dark ; light serves distraction so put base unit face next bed , direction microphone speaker face this `` fix '' makes clarity volume audio ( monitoring intercom ) dampened i would not therefore buy unit use ( i received free review copy therefore willing live limitations ) if would n't mind bright blue light , best baby monitor i aware `` after , 6 months use one parent units completely shot i tried reset unit replaced battery unsuccessful getting work 2 months later second parent unit stopped working i called customer service tried walk troubleshooting steps nothing worked so , year ownership less year use monitor rendered useless i would like baby monitor least make first 18 months one child , preferably one child with `` stuff '' purchased new baby hard justify cost disposable monitor works well 6 months 
-1	update : after three months , one parent units stopped working all lights came sound registered when i contacted customer service , i told unit defective contact store purchased refund/exchange after six months , i fed monitor the blue light bright we hide parent unit bed , still lights room the parent child unit seem lose connection quite frequently , resulting either sound received child 's room loud beep turn unit reset a frequent clicking sound also grates after nine months , parent unit went kaput i definitely not recommend monitor initial review : we 've using monitor month , seems work well we n't noticed interference our old sony monitor channels , one not , n't seem need we 've even used parent unit room old sony parent unit without problem ( one monitor child 's bedroom ) the parent units nice slim handy clip the monitor bright blue light blinks parent unit not turned , seems little annoying child , monitor better placed sight child 's room also , turn child unit , parent units beep the feature intended help find parent unit , unintended effect encouraging leave child unit times waste electricity when battery runs charge parent units , indicator light turns red , battery runs middle night , would never know my old sony monitor made beeping sound battery running while annoying awoken beeping noise , least knew monitor stop working it n't seem pick sound quite well old unit could hear baby breathing several feet away with first child , i wanted hear every breath with second child , i appreciate not hearing every breath long i hear stirring sounds occasionally , monitor definitely picks the two parent units nice i 'm not always backtracking find unit bed -- i leave one downstairs one upstairs 
-1	i live techie house lots wifi , cell signal extenders , etc so i ca n't honestly say something else might caused interference i experienced model , however , i imagine living large city apartment building 'd run problems faced monitors i n't able use week without giving while packaging , design features great , actual quality signal not i not recommend purchasing product 
-1	had high hopes monitor the features looking price seemed reflect quality monitors range , figured would great straight away issues:1 static feedback occurred matter tried ( re-setting , moving unit etc ) 2 the reset button one parent units poorly positioned ( straight box ) needed careful manipulating get it 3 customer service tomy useless inquiry & wanted perform odd tasks order return item i ended getting 'no questions asked ' refund amazon ' ! awesome - thanks amazon ! might suit somebody else 's needs , close money get pretty well-known & reliable movement & sound monitor works ten times better ( n't get anywhere near static ! ) hint

-1	i spent extra money i coordinating bed skirt , blanket , & pillow i wanted son 's room look nice put-together this dead way loose standard-sized changing pad , though , n't look good i returned & got carter 's cover sage coordinates well enough looks much better overall 
-1	we actually wound three first two broke totally normal use the screen pretty small , although picture good the handset absolutely battery life literally would unplug , would turn instantly replug across house turn not bad camera , would n't really recommend 
-1	bought 3rd child , previously owning graco system lots research , chose system new baby seemed like good stroller/ travel system price unfortunately , car seat not fit cars - saturn honda hung seat 2 '' + tried parents cars also found problem ford & chrysler return amazon took back start

-1	we bought booster seat 10 day trip hawaii , figuring would easier sit us meals chase around unfortunately , found booster seat quite unsafe active 9 mos old the first time used ( securing chair , tightening harness ) leaned sideways reach something hanging leg , dangling chair needless say , thankful not fallen quite frightened the next day tried , time literally crawled chair onto table that funny scary , i packed put away definitely ca n't understand popularity booster , experience

-1	i bought daughter getting constant diaper rashes we tried use made even wetter plastic hard uncomfortable 
-1	to keep ameda pump running well , need replace valves every often tear ameda sells valves 2-pk containers ; five came unmarked white bag - ameda name anywhere the price slightly better ameda valve valves n't sturdy firm they feel like made inferior material & # 34 ; looser & # 34 ; 2-pk ameda they fine , i guess , i not really tell pumping output decreased valves , certainly n't increased i irrittaed valves sold & # 34 ; ameda & # 34 ; valves i pretty sure generic brand 
-1	they tear easily i like pump , hate constantly replace valves be careful washing 
-1	bought return 2 reasons:1 sizing wrong , making coverage area breasts bit weird2 skin irritated wearing 
-1	before i baby i nervous pretty much everything imagined worst i never issues sore boobs nursing i nursed year no problems showering otherwise did n't need if considering purchasing baby born , wait see going need first this well similar products complete waste money 
-1	considering i paid $ 350 stroller , total disappointment i expecting especially reading great reviews two issues : the design overall poor materials made cheap 
-1	i read measurements ! the picture makes look large actually smaller plastic tub 
-1	works perfect , could n't ask anything different keeps baby boy safe happy little tub easy fill suctions wall drying keep way follow : 2 months later popped , deflated ca n't use would not buy 
-1	the tub fits standard bathtub well very good construction quality not much else say oh , suction perfect keep tub dry update 7 months later : noticed tub loosing pressure yesterday , came home today work found tub completely empty air there visible perorations anywhere tub signs damage abuse i expected tub last least one year oh well dropping stars 5 1 it probably cost shipping ways rather buying another one 
-1	even 2/3 cup full , pop open frozen ca n't closed some lids dont seal properly ( some snap shut , smash shut dont shut ) drop one frozen shatter they do stack stack freezing , frozen ca n't stack together , wont snap and force , , shatter love size idea , using less two weeks three broken , half wont seal , im already shopping replacement set but terrific want refridgerate stuff ! 
-1	top pops open freezer ( even half full ) unlike freezer trays , difficult get content put inside freezer bags i tend cook batches evening weekend beaba multiportion freezer trays far best product purpose 
-1	i gave away after going trouble making baby food , i n't want spilling leaking everywhere the little tray idea great idea , takes much space freezer , not practical the lids n't stay consistently some great , n't i reused old baby food jars i washed dishwasher sterilize instead avoided issues plastic way , anyway 
-1	touted baby essential , however slippery top 's hard not slip around 's much smaller expected also n't finishing edges always appears unfinished 's point getting something looks nice always looks sloppy 
-1	elastic already came appart sheet have using less 2 months i liked sheet first , not much i thought would last longer 
-1	i washed i initailly recieved fine i washed first use , came dryer shredded pieces ! not worth money , buy something else 
-1	i got flannel fitted crib sheet yesterday i washed baby detergent strong smell plastic packaging when i pulled dryer i noticed sheets unraveled elastic the sheets fell apart i n't even used yet horrible ! 
-1	the sheet fit tightly bassinet attachment pack play , felt rough , cheaply made i ca n't speak durability washes , baby hated bassinet much never slept 
-1	i bought shades wider i 've found stores , 's pretty much going it pros:1 ) wider ones i 've able find stores cons:1 ) the suction cups useless they always seem fall either i close door randomly i driving i not even get bottom suction cup stick shade left dangle -- could contributing factor keeps falling i use top suction cups brica sun shade left dangling i never issue falling off 2 ) cheaply made thin flimsy the brica one i previous much sturdier , i returned one n't wide enough update : however , plus side cheaply made `` hooks '' thin bypasses window 's safety feature automatically rolling back detects something way i originally avoided trying `` hooks '' brica sun shade , windows automatically rolled i tried use hooks but frustration shades falling , i gave shot windows closed 3 ) the side faces outside everyone else white makes logo stand it 's not even good looking logo either fortunately logo near bottom i pull shade pass window n't show 
-1	these shades horrible the suction cups n't work n't really block sun i ended buying eddie bauer sun shades - peel on/peel style allows roll window work much better much cheaper ! plus nothing could become projectile event car accident 
-1	i not ordering not slanted edge- really helps trimming babies nails they also small size makes difficult maneuver i find priced quality 
-1	this grinds food fine except huge space top plunger blade - wastes ton food i 've used others n't cost less 
-1	no i would not recommend one baby teether part poorly made 's cheap feeling dissapointed ! ! ! to say least ! kc not reccommend shower gift baby rattle good quality sorely dissapointed kc 
-1	this would great product strap neck longer i felt like i choking daughter every time i put preemie , big n't issue she liked , i terrified take eyes she used 15 minutes i decided i would never rest easy 
-1	the woombie good idea , not made lo she getting strong swaddles i thought would work while kept , woombie not made lo 's put hands head while zipped night baby tried reach subsequently flipped zipper cover collar mouth nose stayed being new mom i panicked sent back next day 
-1	we tried woombie daughter started growing miracle blanket the miracle blanket wonderful , comes newborn size the miracle blanket two layers restraint -- one pin arms another wrap around body it worked amazingly well us in contrast , woombie tight sack our daughter frustrated she able move arms , n't able put hands mouth soothe basically , worst worlds our daughter able move enough could startle , could not move enough soothe sucking hands total waste money us 
-1	we tried lot swaddles 6 types , best miracle blanket , loving baby pod styles we 10 woombie swaddles would n't recommend them the woombies inconsistent quality some arrived velcro closure neck causes horrible scrapes/cuts baby 's chin face ( velcro closure not mentioned descriptions amazon ) others arrive snap closure ( much preferable snap quiet not scratch baby ) some `` big baby '' woombies bigger `` mega baby '' woombies ( megas supposed bigger bigs ) some collars different material pictured amazon the material collars give makes easier babies get hands arms when contacted woombie various problems , get defensive rigid they never offered discount , replace repair confronted various problems lesson learned ; buy woombies amazon directly may 'll need return despite , pod type swaddle consistent best performer two kids instead overpriced inconsistent woombie , like summer infant swaddlepod summer infant swaddlepod , ivory , newbornit half price better quality thanks reading , i hope review helpful ! 
-1	i received gift the material soft i love pattern started pilling one wash also comes undone easily swaddle like better stroller blanket 
-1	these blankets incredibly soft lightweight , except designs they painted rough even opposite side design rough very disappointing 
-1	i previously purchased ( expensive ) a & a organic cotton muslin swaddle blanket i i love i purchased lower cost bamboo/rayon swaddle blankets i would n't laundry every day - i assumed would similar organic cotton muslin version not ! these blankets incredibly soft lightweight , not swaddle nicely my 5-week old son wiggles blankets easily soft slippery i wish i purchased expensive blankets begin i stuck useless ones i still buy others if looking silky soft , lightweight blankets , want something make nice swaddle , go organic muslin 
-1	i love hate relationship aden anais when i originally got muslin blankets , i wasnt quite sure use first living midwest frigid temps , i didnt think i could use lighteweight blankets months , i ended using everything , burp cloth , blankies , etc my baby loved much i bought loveys dream blankets i decided upgrade these boy i disappointed yes , soft much thinner fragile originals makes useless the fabric also delicate easy snag for intended purpose blankets didnt cut i sticking beloved original muslns 
-1	zippers suck seriously ca n't afford ykk zippers suckers ? i got halo fleece sleep sack instead 
-1	i tend try buy things practical reasonably priced i splurged one sleepers i saw sale i heard good things brand wanted give try both husband i like sleeper material it 's definitely nice see son cozy warmer weather not feel like 's overheating it 's three weeks i 've found several snags one i know happened fingernail caught thread i concerned snags unravel several washes we use velcro bibs i try keep away sleeper i know contact probably ruin this if durable i would consider buying next size keep growth these kids 're talking , i n't time careful given cost delicate nature fabric , i wo n't buying another one **update**the sleeping bag eventually result inner layer ripping one seam the sleeper still usable definitely annoying frayed edge way one side near zipper we continued use grew without rips i send picture company letting know rip hopefully find way improve future products 
-1	i got fairies sleeping bag i actually really excited the fairies not look anything like picture they look like mosquitos they big dark pink ( almost red ) wings picture shows little fairies different colors otherwise i really love aden & anais blankets they old school yet pretty feel i love fabric looks crinckly yet elegant i dont like fleece heavy blankets since might overheat baby i definetly use summer nights , put baby onesie my baby sleeps crib blankets tucked side it worked great started roll kick blanket i would wake frequently night see kicked blanket i finally realized i cant spend nights paranoid baby cold shes okay item gives peace mind update- i wish worked however baby woke night wasnt warm enough her we live california room mostly 70 75 degrees i got grobag 2 5 tog sleeps night design fabric alot better aden anais bag 
-1	the previous reviewer correct for $ 15 get one box bags they also n't fit right i made work i , i wo n't buy 
-1	people used ask diaper champ not stink- i always said actually paid extra cash bought bags made diaper champ i turned lot people idea buying bags always worked well us and like previous reviewers i shocked find bags completely changed they different average garbage bag course nothing contain odor dirty diapers in addition n't fit diaper champ well , much narrow hard keep place n't hold many what rip change good product ? ! 
-1	oh , great weeks i even used shopping cart kept toddler 's snack drink away cart gave something i shopped the trouble kept removing carseat i driving , dumping contents everywhere she broke arm one , i broke trying tighten extent could not remove i shocked 2 broken within week sof purchase - looks stronger really it 's unfortunate 
-1	i love features mirror , unfortunately n't work i ordered two great reviews , i 'm really surprised low quality product : ( 1- the mirror makes baby look far away , i ca n't even see eyes open not it shows little pea head really far away ! not helpful 2- i returned one remote n't work , i got replacement , i accidentally dropped remote floor , n't work either unfortunately features n't work without , either 3- the light great idea , nowhere near bright enough light baby unfortunately neither i husband handy enough replace bulb led lights , like reviewer ! unfortunately , i thrown away packaging i ca n't return products , i would not recommend anyone else 
-1	i purchased sale amazon around 60 $ seemed like pretty good deal when stroller first came i happy , looks pretty nice i bought daughter outgrew infant car seat/travel system knowing i usually carried walks beco baby carrier i would definitely say first several months stroller got light use ! now daughter 14 months sadly i finding hard neck wear long walks ( kind chunk : ) stroller really cumbersome , front wheels always locking i kick get right direction plus , i never happy bulky fold , takes lot trunk space stroller really n't preform umbrella stroller i feel amount use really n't front wheel issues i def would n't pay 80 $ i see price gone since i bought i think i going shell money pricier stroller , i guess one lessons first baby i learn , n't cheap stroller : ) 
-1	i purchased stroller may 2011 at first , i pleased it seemed sturdy fit daughter well however , november 2011 i major problem wheel while crossing street daughter wheel turned stopped stroller going forward this happened several occassions scary the last thing want stroller malfunction street light turning green it downhill by january 2012 i could n't evern turn stroller without malfunctioning drag turn i would definitely not recommend stroller it looks good first require purchase replacement stroller sure 
-1	i bought stroller bc i original kolcraft contours , great stroller this stroller hand cheap it short ( i 5'6 ) even pushing canopy felt cheap i immediately took apart sent back it okay sale price i bought i would much rather joovy kooper anyday i 'd say spend extra get something nicer i looking buying peg perego si 
-1	although transaction went smoothly , i problem product when i bought item , i thought good deal i got , arrived the shields not hold shape they sticky flimsy these better left trash 
-1	i bought theses nipple sields cheap i though might good back i misplaced damaged madela shield using they think stiff also , holes not let much milk i not like 
-1	i purchased gate install stairs i ended installing somewhere else i 'm afraid baby able rattle loose gate might not close baby fall stairs initially i n't mind gate , i come absolutely hate ! i wish i would returned i would much rather non-swinging gate step deal definite flaws gate my major disappointments gate are:1 the gate ca n't tightened much wall otherwise door swing back not latch closed ( ie baby crawl right ) 2 unless open door all the way , wo n't swing back hard enough close if open enough walk , wo n't latch swings back closed position3 even door latched , i bend gate back forth enough dislodge it4 the door really hard open it requires pressing flat button sliding across , certainly not easy in opinion , good thing gate looks nice 
-1	i find gate extra small step bottom may make even unsafe not gate especially carrying baby use top stairs i also not like latch design one best looking gates market , probably ok n't use top stairs 
-1	i bought originally use top stairs , however , n't work the pressure mount would always come loose i worried hazard leaving stairs open it seems though pressure particular tight latch gets stuck , loose gate comes place opening shutting gate would cause pressure loosen , i constantly adjusting it instead returning item , i use doorway i still hate i 'm always tripping piece goes across bottom stationary gate i guess i 'd rather trip flat surface rather trip top stairway 
-1	have used regular ultimate crib sheet great this organic one terrible much thinner material topper single wash cold water hanging dry , topper shrunk literally 6 inches as waterproof underside still size , sheet completely warped this going back - i 'll stick original ultimate crib sheet 
-1	i really excited use setting vibrated crib really nicely i think would calmed little guy down the reason i gave one star testing voice activation crib rocker started smell burning plastic felt hot touch no way i going keep baby 's crib maybe got dud n't going give another try i 'm really disappointed n't work us i believe 's wonderful idea ! 
-1	shakes , loud also didnt think i bought my crib changing table/shelfing unit attached so when thing shakes , everything shakes it bangs wall , opposite effect kind funny item bulky stick front crib way 
-1	i say overall quality pretty poor this crib rocker really n't shake crib rock mattress , rattles crib rails we pack n ' play rocker sits mattress really nice job rocking baby this nothing like , box bolt onto rails crib sort rattles around we pretty nice quality crib - graco sarah - n't shake much it might work , n't expect anything nice come box 
-1	we 're expecting first baby jan 2011 i bought mattress replace super thin mattress ourgraco pack 'n play playard with bassinet , elephant parade i definitely not impressed mattress i knew reviews 's slight gap ( 1 1 5 inch ) , i expecting i n't , however , expect mattress soo soft not mention 's thin still feel steel beams along bottom bassinet i idea baby would ok sleeping not , 's definitely not something i 'd feel comfortable , i would n't use child i guess softness `` relative '' , mattress seems way soft infant ( might ok toddler ) i returned purchased dream on me extra firm mattress , 'll see works 
-1	the product good , i hate give less stellar star rating i want advise mattress n't fit graco pack n play go portable crib like i seen noted reviews maybe 're fine sticking towel gap could get away , 's 2 inches short width length i went little larger dream product as i stated earlier , still good product n't work graco portable crib like advertised 
-1	i purchased dream port crib i figured manufacturer would good fit , unfortunately there way much gap feel comfortable not quite 3 month old sleeping it much hassle send back , i hold use pack n play gets older sids not much risk in mean time i ordered `` sunshine 3 '' ultra firm mini crib mattress '' 39 x 25 x 5 inches vs mattress 38 x 24 x 3 inches hopes tighter fit not soft i know not recommended use mattress thicker 3 '' porta crib , common sense tell reason would easier climb able pull walk , obviously able risk sids/suffocation not issue thinner , softer mattress would acceptable 
-1	the mattress 37 25 inches long not 38 inches listed `` product dimensions the width also short 0 75 inch made 100 % polyeurethane i never buy i weary dream me products future 
-1	plastic like smell daysi n't know material 3 & # 34 ; thickness not satisfied mattress gave way kid 's body weight not fat ( @ 24lbs ) 
-1	this mattress contains polyurethane , toxic chemical cause asthma maybe even sids ! the studies not completely conclusive , connection polyurethane sids better safe sorry - n't purchase foam mattress contains polyurethane ! this chemical used many mattresses even furniture - last place want find chemical baby crib ! what shame chemical used even baby mattresses , makes sick as soon i unpacked mattress , smelled like & # 34 ; plastic & # 34 ; , never good sign 
-1	i added wish list received gift i bought based reviews surprised i opened box not made plastic , i expecting , also cardboard ! ! i read one review stated n't the worse part cardboard wrapped around bassinet not lined correctly caused top plastic buckle cardboard lined inch ! it hung inch top not enough sadly i felt bassinet cheap i would not trust place newborn i going shop around another not recommend product based poorly made 
-1	i 'm disappointed i got baby shower loved idea all-in-two system i swap inserts there couple problems first , flap holds insert short , couple inches , squirming baby tough get insert stay place second , one wash normal cycle , nylon flap ( holds insert place ) ripped the rip going get larger time i stretched diaper , useless uses i think i 'll try systems b/c quality one really lacking 
-1	issues cleaning instructions make chore half - not soak , wash first cold , hot seriously , time two washes ? might sahm lot besides washing diapers day , energy required washing diapers twice kind negates earth-saving , `` keep non-biodegradable crap landfill '' reasons wanted go cloth anyway wash covers hand need , soak inserts cold water bit oxyclean overnight prior hot wash also , one warned get yer babe decked one setups , none cute newborn clothes fit , especially 've got little fatty like - 's got really limited time adorable newborn clothes everyone gave anyway , signed amazon mom , got subscription nature baby eco-disposables got 160 $ 30 - yep , 's breastfed newborn goes ten day , disposables money hemorrhage sure , elastic tabs , 're natural ( gel ) quickly compostable landfill 'm putting flips aside poops little less constantly clothes might actually fit things 're also starting little bit elimination communication since 's pretty easy predict - perhaps save little effort dealing wash diapers time 
-1	why bother ? ! elastic came things numerous times , inserts arrived dirt marks flip covers many large , hard snaps press baby 's skin sizing limited thick prefold diapers ( mine organic unbleached ) works small medium cover ; legs openings tight prefold diapers shape large waist narrow hips - bizarre cover thick polyester not breathable , overheats the inserts thick synthetic side worthless - resembles thick feminine menstrual pad poo could slide pick elastic back , stiff cover ( n't stretch much ) front not expand stretch baby sitting this would funny movie , 's really flippin ' nightmare ! 
-1	i used prefolds covers lot , one tended move every time could n't keep prefold straight would change entire ensemble every time one reasons i liked prefolds covers ability change prefold use cover several times not case one had change cover every time 
-1	here 's i 've learned last couple months : n't get obscure brand baby anything i find stroller work or adapter stroller i wrote safety 1st confused model number even though seat brand new i wish i 'd gotten whole travel system stayed away brand 
-1	leggings nice soft cashmere-type material frayed second went wash i n't even think going issue since i little legs products n't issue just wash hand 
-1	i specifically looking narrow backless booster fit 3-in-a-row back seat sedan , not narrow the description says 12 '' , i see means internal width , not width whole thing ! i 'm sure 's great booster , i feel like i wasted bunch time going back 
-1	i city select got adapter chicco key fit30 together i read reviews hand , tried store two products seemed best us ( i bought brick mortar helped us service fantastic ) individually i like usability the adapter kit poor though , really irritating sell design , never mind price even frustrating read reviews adapters chicco , example uppababy system , find little care could made great fitting adapter n't even use straps secured i looked design flaw fairly obvious take minute the bar holds head car seat low , seat settled grey `` tabs '' lock release seat adapter car seat base partially depressed structure cross pieces if angle head side bar held seat higher would not allow tabs get half pressed so click secure locked position , gets half unlocked goes past this loose , also pull upward head car seat `` locked '' slip right this added ridiculous strap system chicco stroller adapters get fine without it if look box sticker says designed use chicco brand car seats under sticker , peel back , says designed `` several popular brands car seat '' lists bunch brands , not chicco this clearly made universal possible cure strap added 's design counter-acts locking mechanism case keyfit like others , going keep stroller best one wife fold lift trunk , chicco best safety rating , i super disappointed adapter it work , safe , i feel scammed price care design even frustrating see easy would address issue if knew i could bend bar proper angle without weakening structure i would , i guess 'll stick cheesy straps safe ride baby long story short ? works safe necessary want travel system two devices feels like slap face , though 
-1	way much work way easier get cover kids basket sense way tricky product 
-1	i love love love huge basket stroller hate hate hate leaves dirt fall i stroll ! i walk dog daily stroller sees outdoors a lot and i hate leaves debris fly drop basket i 'm ocd would prefer basket clean ! since option available i thankful baby jogger even created i bought definitely needs improvement ! 1 clasps come easily ! one particular like tight something snap soon i clip soooo annoying i meaning contact baby jogger replacement baby time ? i finally sitting write bunch amazon reviews ! the two front tend come i fold stroller so , i want go somewhere put stroller car , i take entire cover first ( come anyways ) another major annoyance 2 6 clasps 2 front , 2 sides 2 back the 2 sides attached low bar this creates sagging mid-section i really wished 4 clasps sides put 2 higher ( close would attach seat ) because sag material creates , leaves debris sit middle canopy how ugly , dirty gross ! 3 i think instead clasps , would great could create sort zipper attachment attach frame this way , would completely enclosing basket would allow access basket whole lot easier perhaps 2-3 zippers ? one back , side front allow access basket sides accessing anything inside basket via undoing clasp very annoying fumble feel clasp fumble snapping back ( back ) pop easily 4 i like cheap since baby jogger sells accessories ridiculously high prices ! = ) because annoying access stuff inside basket cover , i mainly use keep basket clean i 'm strolling outdoors dog if i plan going somewhere baby , i leave cover since i need put diaper bag , etc there i hope baby jogger reads reviews listen customer feedback update design ! 
-1	'm not sure billed spill proof soon turn upside , leaks like crazy , makes little parts pain it nice cup baby first starts solids , used give water soft spout nice but soon could pick use , 's crazy mess 
-1	we 4 cups plus stainless one loved they easy drink , leak proof top snapped shut fairly easy wash these straw cups i used toddler past 1+ yr however , i recently learned disturbing news plastic material use cups , called tritan it 's made eastman company touted bpa-free ultra-safe however , question safety testing methods suggest tritan may leach substances worse bpa there comparisons eastman big tobacco that 's scary , especially health baby concerned i 'm disappointed learn disturbing news cup trusted loved much especially disturbed companies would play & # 34 ; games & # 34 ; things affect babies health ( thought i 'm not entirely surprised ) i gave 2 stars instead 1 bc well designed however , , sadly , wo n't using cups anymore shame eastman 
-1	ehhhhh this cup verrated not much better cup says spill proof i yet find one actually 100 % spill proof hey i skeptical reviews said n't spill proof ones said , ive leaned wasnt also chewed thru the strae rubber 2 year old son bit so 's not toddlers say 2 lol he something cup straws 
-1	the instructions come cup say : `` this product leak-proof lid closed locked position '' that means cap child drinking , leaks ! there air hole top cup milk , water , juice , anything put cup come right child drinks forget child turns upside , eventually - liquid streams during fist use , son swimming pool milk i wish not air hole would perfect straw cup - everything else great 
-1	it leaked soon i filled water , turned upside test -- water came pouring top hole serves air vent many sippy cups toddler cups , not one leaked one -- river water ! ! there way not know , right ? what think ? that never fall open lid ? it not leak only cap shut close -- plastic cap little piece goes air vent hole thus stops leak but , expects toddler responsible careful enough close every time -- not realistic for price , i ca n't decide i even bother returning donating store poor soul buys $ 5 
-1	this waste money return policy awful so stuck first , not close lid keeps popping i hate sippy cup i wish i never purchase one do not buy buy nuk disney ones 
-1	i 'm giving sippy cup i like pink purple color combo , 's my daughter left sippy floor fell i room ten seconds came back puddle ! it leaks silicone nub i know droplets wate come vent hole , one pours 
-1	i gave 2 stars instead one , design the bottle poorly many , ca n't believe foogo made the bottle leaks not standing position not i expected 
-1	this sippy cup back cabinet year leaked badly i stopped using 2 weeks ago i decided give another try i filled cold water hot , hot summer day i put car & drove daughter park when time take break & get drink , i retrieved passenger seat car the cup completely empty & seat soaked ! this cup n't even pretend leak-proof ! it leaks around entire rim , leaks air hole , & leaks sippy spout in addition , full & daughter tries drink , so little water comes ! she must take many many `` drinks '' get full mouth water it 's not fair make work hard drink water ! i tempted write company long time , i read reviewers stated customer service not great it 's sad nice-looking , promising , *expensive ! ! * cup would lemon i not recommend cup we use towels & fan dry seat car ! this cup back cabinet reason ! 
-1	nice looking cup , lid difficult clean , 's ended back cupboard 
-1	cons : it takes tremendous force generate flow trying get 10 month infant use impossible since not suck hard enough get anything only way use either remove leak proof valve ( longer leak proof ) pros : looks nice , material seems sturdy , stainless steel bottom ( plastic cover , valve , mouthpiece 
-1	this awful sippy cup the silicone valve actually sip poorly designed leaks easily if daughter shakes , good amount liquid comes flying spout ( know babies spend much time playing stuff high chair actually eating ) it also quite heavy 10 month old lift the pros easy clean keeps drinks insulated well 
-1	this exactly looking give 2-year old son sippy cup warm cool beverages unfortunately , cup spout leaks like crazy ! more sippy cup i 've tried 
-1	i really really want like cup we live area temperature 100 degrees three months summer so cup keep drinks cool neccessity convenience i purchased one several years ago first child small , pretty horrible 5 years later , i 'm child # 3 i decide give another shot , hoping maybe design improved i disappointed while look like made changes , i never got chance see flaws previous design remedied , son ( almost 3 ) could not manage get much one sip it 's really shame , thermos brand straw cups kids excellent , love , n't spill proof occasions spill proof needed we ended returning cup 
-1	i purchased sippy two foogo products worked well us unfortunately one not work you not get liquid i tried sucking liquid could not you could take pieces mouth piece would pointless sippy , spilling liquid got tipped unfortunately sits collects dust cupboard : ( 
-1	no problems except : i *barely* suck liquid sippy cup one year old not i 've resorted leaving hard plastic piece putting silicone piece least slow leak cup -- i assist comes fast way chokes otherwise so 's still not independent cup i 've washed dishwasher many times not improved first sippy cup i 've ever experience perhaps like ? the cup also heavy full ( b/c 's stainless steel insulated , sturdy ) -- perhaps appropriate older baby 
-1	so i looking forward i always found pads pack n plays not thick cushiony i would like well thing n't help it n't soft , plastic-y feel not breathable fabric whenever i put baby sleep back would end soaked sweat i 'd change swaddle clothes middle night when i take use regular pack n play pad , n't sweat so not good hot climate even air conditioning , thing hot i wish i n't bought 
-1	i ordered bags due thicker plastic seemingly superior quality i 'm disappointed 2 bags already leaked 25 count package i opened i wo n't purchase i zero issues lansinoh bags leaking - not thick plastic , apparently better quality 
-1	i high hopes get good reviews almost every bag 50 leak the leaks different spots think defective 
-1	i ordered bags not problem , recent box i got , nearly all bags leaked i defrosting milk refrigerator i lost several ounces milk pretty big bummer expensive bags , hard work provide store milk babies ! 
-1	i purchased bags cheaper the quality price i really like lansinoh bags best these bags flimsy n't stand well even milk , could spill easily , i also not feel zip closure secure 
-1	i mixed feelings bed , love hate time pros : study , beautiful , affordable cons : slats n't fit they would pop bed even toddler bed unfortunately n't realize son started sleeping bed turns middle slat longer , causing bed bow outwards middle as result , remaining slats not flt properly would plink whenever contacted seller requested new set slats , unable comply they offered return , would n't anything two year old sleep waited replacement ( sold crib already , son refused sleep ) , i opted & # 34 ; 15 % refund & # 34 ; option i got ta say , 7 bucks really n't help our new plan shave 1/4 & # 34 ; middle slat try squeeze bowing section bed frame back position hold slats hoping works if slats fit , i able get replacement slats ( fit ) , i would given bed 5 stars , question 
-1	everybody i know loves , i hate they n't stretchy they hard get fastened diaper correctly i switched old fashioned & # 34 ; safety pins & # 34 ; instead maybe i n't using correctly ? like i said , i 'm one i know n't like i 'm sure 's good product , not everyone ( least ) lol 
-1	my 18 mos daughter using teether i noticed big gap bottom front teeth i noticed clear rubber gummy part come gotten lodged teeth we able get using tweezers tooth back certainly never would noticed i probably would take dentist get removed it not easy get took two us actually could used another person someone available i contacted company via email not heard back yet i would certainly not buy another one ! 
-1	the `` guard '' prevent choking useless , say , child decides put hard end mouth they designed soft parts ends also , end harbors bacteria 
-1	i purchased zoli stick gum massagers along teethifier 15 month old , cutting first set molars he never used pacifier , i n't sure product would work us honestly , n't use either back-teeth teethers much , bed 'll chew teethifier read books , i leave crib sometimes i find chewing morning it make drool ton he not used zoli stick teethers handful times , time turns around chews non-rubbery end i worry 'll push far mouth using way , since stopper end all , little one 's molars seem bothersome , i would recommend teethifier stick teethers 
-1	my daughter obsessed zoli cup i think zoli mats amazing i thought maybe molar miracles would work toddler unfortunately , far expectations i returned when toddler teething , i highly doubt he/she knows use massager part tip soft gummy , rest hard i afraid daughter would hurt trying bit areas a far better option sprouts version 's around gummy tip massager , well 
-1	my baby likes i watch easily makes gag the disc higher adjustable 
-1	but i washed anyway $ 15 dollars i hoping teething son would love ! but hard ( besides tip ) i 'm afraid chewing hard parts 's not supposed should bought $ 5 one could chew anywhere he `` kind '' able use n't really use much bangs stuff 
-1	my 7 month old four teeth working these great teethers get back teeth however , design safety issues when turns teether around puts long end mouth , obviously long gags secondly , like giving baby pencil , ready poke eye minute these would ideal shorter teether sides , instead longer , dangerous handle we let use twice monitor closely decided put away together avoid getting ahold without full attention 
-1	i 'm not sure twins would rather chew spoon it smaller picture not much chew 
-1	i thought would great solution baby teething , especially able reach back the quality good the colours beautiful rubber gentle gums but i found baby really liked put wrong side mouth causing gag ! yes , supervision required things baby puts mouth but price , i n't think 's worth i 2 kids love chewing toothbrush ! i found best solution ( supervision also required prevent gagging ) 
-1	these really good idea , design wrong teething babies portion go mouth long when holding gently rubbing baby 's gums , even careful , little one moves around sometimes lurches forward grabs hand , right ? these normal baby moves , stick long moves cause gagging stick placed far safety stop also soft silicone tip affixed tip makes worried little chewer could pull right perfect choking hazard happens i n't recommend unless improve design get another kind teether 
-1	a regular kids tooth brush worked better kids my kids tossed massagers aside not saying bad product , kids n't like much 
-1	my 6 month old tooth coming back hard reach teethers tried although i liked concept teether , handle long even safety guard would easily gag we not used product since initially bought i felt unsafe 
-1	though product worked perfectly week , became bane existence at risk sounding repetitive , thing leaks it leaks sitting table it leaks full half filled it leaks even check leaks sink , see nothing dripping , hand toddler guaranteed , 5 minutes later , 's going leak it leaks straw , leaks threads ( despite threaded correctly ) i 'm convinced leaks pores there 's quite one star reviews telling exactly happens ( 's kind pressure buildup happening inside , matter liquid , causes liquid come back straw drip everywhere ) 's even video watch , avoid cup like plague really 
-1	although concept cup great son never get last sip water dripping spilling it leaks constantly i not put anything cup water leaking issue if i put cup fridge take water leaks top vice versa i bought cup great reviews i not think worth money also straw impossible clean another reason i use water sanitary reasons i would not recommend cup 
-1	see update : the functionality cup great first no leaks , easy use 5 months ? i notice black chips floating baby 's water see plastic film top nozzle peeling i got manually , n't see anymore flakes then , straw part started discolor i noticed filling mold now straw dark gray color i ca n't even pass another child use straight trash unacceptable update : i went store sells cup ask much mold the store owner explained all sippy cups get moldy ( 's nature water ) fact one brands sell extra straws straw cleaners some brands make buy whole new cup ! so i went thinking cup awful , actually happy i bought replacement straws way 
-1	this sippy cup paper looks great the straw soft wo n't harm palate , relatively easy take apart , straw mechanism works reasonably well deliver liquid however , not get 2 months use tossed them here cons : - cup leaks the straw leaks top leaks its not thread perfectly , also closed not tight not loose somewhere middle might non-leaking tightness , unless 5 minutes adjust/re-adjust multiple times not worth it - straw leaks if anything water , prepare squirting straw especially open close flip top- cup not hold if child like mine occasionally drop things ( not necessarily even throw , drop ) , cup not wear tear well every drop pavement dent hard plastic create rough plastic burrs i 'm not surprised reviewers cup crack 
-1	this cup leaks pretty bad , teething baby chewed straw 10 months old love weighted straw though , handles 
-1	i loved sippee cup b/c babies refused drink milk bottle they started using cup 7 months i originally gave 5 star review however , i 'm changing star 1 b/c 1 ) i 've found mold growing you diligent cleaning special straw looking mold you replace straw find mold i ok problem 2 ) while baby drinking , weight bottom straw broke 2 metal nuts plastic piece floating around drink all 3 choking hazards technically n't know open sippy cup not dangerous however i not know baby drinking milk water metal nuts soaking there may metals leaching drink this i reduced stars 1 i would n't chosen sippy cup i known metal nuts there options or one babies would accept , i would n't bought many i 12 bot sippy cups 2 babies [ ] 
-1	this product would great except one vital flaw - not clean inside straw ! what major design flaw overlook since weighted straw ( keeps straw liquid matter child holds cup ) smart after first uses , milk , i realized straw opens squeezing tip sucking this not happen dishwasher , wants suck rotten milk straw way hand wash ? i checked website cleaning instructions said fill cup hot water , put lid , water push straw i tried , push water , not enough clean you need rinse straw used milk get clean ! the second time i tried hot water n't anything you not clean straw making product useless 
-1	i 've owned four leaked i guess okay room temperature water , ever put cold water , leak like crazy i 've problems product leaking straw joint cup cap on positive , daughter knows use straw , taught that they look great , prepared constantly leaking cup i find unless carrying diaper bag , car , plane , stroller , etc there okay used dinner table 
-1	this company local i wanted love cup leaks right box baby n't squeeze , shake bang cup - tipped drink front wet ! 
-1	no sippy cup perfect , however , one definitely overpriced several flaws first , son dropped cup , regular use , first week bought flexible part top cover snapped two regardless , kept used second , top mis-threads often easily this resulted leaks inopportune times places read negative reviews carefully find common problem yes , know screw lid despite careful , tends mis-thread easily when running around toddler n't always dedicated 5 minutes screw lid sippy cup ! third last , son easily chewed straw i spend additional $ 10 buy replacement straws i agree , third issue debatable if son n't chewed , would probably fine i think price , could create something better quality i would not recommend cup others , much pain 
-1	i love orange ones i bought love products much however blue one i bought , leaks , turns either lid bottle not round shape two never go together need better quality control 
-1	i returned item i realized parts n't come apart allow thorough cleaning it seemed cheaply made for price , i would expect something little practical sturdy 
-1	this cup leaks unbelievably it 's almost impossible stop i 've tried tightening hard i could barely tightening everywhere at best , lid drips slowly at worst water comes like 's lid my wife heard great things cup insisted upon getting after reading reviews i insisted get lansinoh cup we 're happy bought one the lansinoh cup round 'd like , seals great i really complaints the reason gets 2 stars weight bottom straw well designed allows get liquid inside 
-1	i 've tried several times use sippy cup son every time water spills i read reviews suggest making sure everything aligns , i ca n't seem make spill proof 
-1	hard tighten , still spills leaks much ! ! ! sometimes , straw spews like fountain avoid sippy ! ! 
-1	i n't realize i bought i would need specialized straw cleaning tool , sold seperately course no thanks i opened , looked , realized weird knobby thing bottom straw made impossible clean quickly decided would pain deal immediately returned waste time !

-1	i pis pump , replaced tubing fits pump , 87212 however , reason i could n't get enough suction using actually pump milk only one original tubes came pump needed replaced , i switched medela tube one worked perfectly i 'm disappointed 
-1	i bought replacement tubing since tubing full condensation i worried mold developing after using replacement tubing days , i noticed condensation building new tubing had i known build inevitable , i would 've saved money hung original tubing way could dry ( over top fridge worked well ! ) 
-1	items purchased needed old ones got lost remember old ones much stronger well made think knock bootleg quality looks bad 
-1	i bought tubes ago back waited use they not medela tubing - plastic thicker n't fit onto pump well manilla colored pieces different n't fit connector pieces well they 'll work pinch , n't fit right reduced suction pump far less effective i n't think find amazon 're expensive , 's worth buy official medela tubing the membranes hand fit worked perfectly 
-1	i happy find high contrast toys little one unfortunately became not contrasty i washed i followed directions manufacture i washed ice cold water i say ice cold i mean we record breaking zero weather this affects temperature water the water turn fingers icicles running as precaution , i threw half box color catcher sheets ran hand wash cycle machine i wanted cry i took toys everything white turned bright pink what thinking using red dye bleeds like something meant baby ?

-1	the swing pretty ok though seems 1 speed , seems matter speed set still swings i turn , give push times stops swinging i give another push not sure i wish i purchased another swing actually 's supposed 
-1	purchased swing watching harvey karp 's `` happiest baby block '' dvd ( awesome ) he not endorse swing , recommends swings general we purchased swing small transportable to dismay settings swing not fast enough even highest setting swing barely moved our son weighed 11 pounds time , not weight issue it also loud responded negatively vibration the swing currently collecting dust baby 's room the upside compact light weight 
-1	do n't waste money ! this like sway swing the toy bar adds weight makes sway slower good thing 's detachable it nice vibrating option 's two one kinda thing it 's cute the music good feature well it n't swing it 's likely 's way back store spring regular size swing it takes room house valuable tool baby mommy ( want clean house ) 
-1	my baby could get hands matter big tight fit disappointing 
-1	i brought daughter home hospital put swaddle first night home she not like she type baby wanted sprawl stretch this probably works great babies like swaddled 
-1	i one month old extremely high maintenance , arms problem she loves free , , whacks scratches face , simply flails wakes i tried swaddlepod first born , within seconds hands made way near neck stuck way the material stretchy wiggly baby , fact hands get stuck neck little scary i recommend spending little extra miracle blanket squirmy baby like i you 'll end spending anyway several unsuccessful swaddles swaddlepod swaddleme 
-1	we got based friend 's recommendation , n't fit baby well our baby 7 lbs born , well within 5-10 pound range described product and snuggly tight newborn but little bit squirming part zipper side instead front the zipper would also sometimes bunch neck get way mouth feedings plus , quickly outgrew time 9 lbs even though 's petite they tight constricting she ended screaming every time put one so started soothing thing ended restricting uncomfortable even 3 months still 10 lbs ( petite ) , i could n't imagine putting they great month got use , ended waste money 
-1	my 3 month daughter swaddle sleeper i saw pod version amazon i decided give try i used first time nap time super easy put ( 's major pro ! ) 15 min nap i heard making little noises i knew not sound asleep i checked whole hand needless say woke : ( regular swaddle sleeps 3 hours naps whole night , swaddle key helping sleep night pod slept 20 min the fabric seems stretchy effective swaddleto recap : pros : easy put take offzippers top bottom ( check diaper without un swaddling baby ) very cutecons : too stretchy baby easily escape swaddleunfortunately n't work baby 
-1	to honest , time kid big enough fit , strong able claw way i bought daughter i addicted swaddling could n't let go , even though sisters kept telling get she getting big standard swaddles i tried n't happy i finally realized 's big girl broke swaddle one night , started sleeping 11-12 hrs night if big baby loves swaddle , go if unhappy big baby 're obsessed swaddling , i recommend going cold turkey swaddle , days figure roll onto belly sleep like angels 
-1	my problem item not n't swaddle well as `` graduate '' i expected much however , i not expecting son 's getting swaddle involving pulling fabric taught around nose mouth i keeping eye i able get , even i n't baby strong would probably fine , still ! seeing baby 's mouth nose covered scary ! i may end using sleep sack , fabric nice i also may use swaddle one arm try `` train '' that way gap air pulls arm but , swaddler , i say product not safe 
-1	i unhappy product ended returning it poorly put together loose strings falling place the way hooks baby not sturdy i ended using one brightstarts instead 
-1	i wanted love cover badly , i really i bought i liked pattern colors price good when i got i also liked padded soft others zipper pockets another bonus i also like idea shoulder straps sounds great right ? right the problem n't fit carts it n't stretch elastic covers make big easy put back seat cart i tried sooo hard stretch back would n't go and n't one one type cart , grocery , target , shops went cover , not cart my husband i kept finding struggling parking lots try make work never also although shoulder straps nice such pain get right i thought maybe one day target tired purchased eddie bauer one store breathed huge sigh relief went quickly easily it also cute little toys strapped front lo play attach toys well it n't plush soft seat like jeep one overall 's much better , easier useful 
-1	first pros : gender neutral colors , five point harness sounds nice , good quality fabric stitching now thoughts using awhile : i n't like and whether like not really depend comort level manipulating fabric straps i wanted `` throw cover go '' , much fabric `` fluff '' , 's confusing un-ball diaper bag , shake , orient material then actual string ties sides , velcro could sufficed why ? why ? then five point harness sounds `` safe '' straps hard adjust / manipulate , never really fit `` right '' around child the problem becomes - 's `` complex '' , never use my husband tossing baby cart seat cover , abhorred thought `` figuring mess '' i wish i saved box sell consignment store i eventually got infantino compact 2-in-1 shopping cart cover ( also amazon ) like much better yes , 's still something need smooth , orient deploy , string ties , lot less `` fluff '' try oragami fold / stuff high chair shopping cart seat i not worried `` dirt '' germs shopping cart , whole point keep daughter 's fingers `` pinch points '' find shopping cart construction got finger one the jeep cover , infantino much easier us use

-1	well , granted , call mattress extra firm however , like laying-on-concrete-firm , not like `` firm '' mattress might imagine both husband i laid found carpeted floor actually comfortable we would n't even use infant , let alone toddler 's basically cardboard 'pad ' comes pack & play 
-1	it poorly designed not fit well it also n't hole shower lift my son able pull halfway 
-1	i bought thinking 'd great solution not drill dresser drawers , keep toddler cabinet holds fish tank stuff ca n't closed another way i was wrong 1 the sticky stuff n't sticky enough work semi-gloss high gloss finish furniture , really smooth surface i used try keep dresser drawers closed , son figured pull hard enough drawer sticky part would pop i 've problems ruining finish furniture , n't stick well enough damage i think command hook sticky things stickier , honestly i 've cause lot damage these 2 they 're ugly dark furniture , 're pretty chunky super obvious 3 they 're not easy open , i jiggle & # 34 ; male & # 34 ; part i squeeze tabs try wiggle save trouble money , buy something attaches screws inside also , if buy , keep mind ca n't go close obstruction ( counter top , example ) otherwise ca n't fit fingers squeeze tabs i guess real way i 'd recommend 're trying keep pet drawer , kid ( ) n't trying constantly get whatever closing ( maybe medicine drawer reach , 're using extra security ? ) 
-1	my grandmother apparently n't get concept childproofing pulled open oven son even got close broke darn thing this not strong woman i glad not kiddo would not recommend product

-1	i disappointed box it 's cheaply constructed also , section top baby book way small hallmark baby book , means put larger section , leaving hardly room larger objects like clothing , baby shoes , toys , etc 
-1	there problems design the biggest one part supposed kid 's head thick makes son 's head fall forward i wish totally flat maybe puffier parts go sides head ( similar neck support ) the pillows sides neck ok although son 's face looked bit squished i looked ( pic attached ) it bulky kid awake , least almost-2-year-old , needs put child falls asleep i guess would problem pillows like that when asleep i put stayed like 45 minutes when i tried adjust head tot side , magnets let go i could n't make stick more i going continue search travel pillow

-1	this least favorite diaper wet bag i thought would hold 6-8 diapers , holds 3-5 one-size pocket diapers two inserts also , picture clearly shows handle arrived nothing like the interior liner bag always inverts wash we restuff , n't horrible , annoying i would suggest kanga care wet bag something big enough get whole day our son 20 months uses 5-ish diapers/day school still so , newborn , big bag last long time or make big bag getting plu fabric local fabric store super easy 
-1	usually i cloth diaper home , visiting family i use disposables running store , play dates although description said small holds one two diapers i disagree honestly i wish i would ordered medium , i love planet wise diaper wet bags otherwise the hanging one rocks , small bag small , listed measurements it measures inch less ways my son toddler holds one diaper i need ball squeeze inside i large hold day half worth diapers i use happy heiny 's , tots bots , flip 
-1	well , date trying numerous wetbags ( planetwise , kushies , mommy 's touch ) , i come conclusion thing wetbag not wick moisture not let smell , esp diapers hour ( big brand i n't tried rumparooz , maybe try future ! ) so , since not much difference brands reasons , annoys wetbag not kind hanging loop handle ( since i i either hang wetbag stroller hang outside diaper bag , since i place in diaper bag , stinks everything ) , i never reach goes unused though bag double layered seems sturdy wetbags , i still choose mommy 's touch wetbag one cause loop/handle i large sized planetwise wetbag , great handle , 's big day outings

-1	i 'm fan manual pumps general -- i 've used medela harmony years supplement double electric i keep work i love manual pump simplicity , efficiency fact i seem extract milk using it but i recently found pinch i away baby 24 hours without pump the dr brown's/simplisse pump available sale vicinity desperation i plunked $ 40 gave try horrible it horrible job removing milk breasts i pumped pumped pumped hand exhausted milk came drop excruciating drop , would stop coming i could tell still quite bit milk breast i 'm sure i assembled correctly i took apart carefully reassembled several times make sure airtight it 's darn gentle good the design also bad including collection bottle stand , pump 11 parts total , versus 7 total medela harmony that 's several extra little parts keep track washing align correctly reassembling simplisse quite misnomer the bulky pumping mechanism also obscures view breast with medela pump , i look easily check alignment breast pump milk flowing with pump , 's easy tell milk stopped flowing but dr brown's/simplisse , ca n't see nipple/breast , 's guessing game whether milk actually produced

-1	my two year old chewed straws flat first time used cups if straws slightly heavier would probably fine n't last couple uses 
-1	i ordered size according child 's size , looked grocery bag around thighs they also kind noisy , not like plastic bag , still noisy they also n't really work keeping pee inside they 're sitting drawer , i n't want throw money away easily lol ! 
-1	since son finally started `` # 2 '' potty potty training going really well , i decided time ditch pull-ups move cotton training pants cover after reading reviews covers i decided order great reviews since everyone said ran big i ordered 2 packs large ( 26-31 pounds ) 34 pound , 38 '' toddler we first accident ( using covers gerber training pants ) today urine rolled legs within seconds he may well worn nothing training pants i purchased bru vinyl covers use arrived not leak accidents the unopened pack going back 
-1	i sent back soon i received they stiff i ca n't imagine would comfortable daughter , would able hear coming mile away crinkly sounding also , i think would cracked torn wash buy nylon version made brand , wonderful ! 
-1	i bought size large nothing : ( my almost 3 yr old petite , wears 3t everything except jeans like 2t these gigantic i think could wear 6 lol i pray not peeing bedtime longer ; ) i would suggest getting one size smaller think need they seem like great buy i gotten right size though 
-1	was n't effective keeping sheets dry ( pee soaked chest instead front/sides ) , i figured maybe loose i washed & dried directed ( low heat ) ; shredded i removed dryer ! ! completely without value , regardless price paid ! ! 
-1	like everyone said , way big i bought almost 4 year old weighs 35 pounds after reading reviews , i bought medium size ( rated 20-25 pounds ) thinking would probably fit accurately , still swimming that said , i 'm not sure work not much empty space cover legs of course pee leaked sides went in opinion , total waste money sizing issue who wants buy something like every different size see fit child since sizing guidelines completely inaccurate ? 
-1	i going give 1 star i n't use long enough find face waterproof i ca n't rate piece i put son underwear immediately started pulling whining telling take they fit perfect around waist , huge butt area tight around thighs literally hurting and son 25th percentile weight , not chunky thighs i even tried putting shorts try distract son noticing n't work luckily ended potty training quickly i n't even need 
-1	i never used i figured would not comfortable what waste money resources 
-1	they plastic , padding anything i suppose could use pampers would means pampers purchased would totally crap these not aid type potty training prevent accidents , everything leaks right i placed pair big boy underwear leaked times 
-1	i read reviews got anyway inexpensive diapers run small they dont hold alot moisture soak entire diaper spend dollars something else 
-1	i gave diaper 2 tries got rid the sizing definately small side the large barely fit 26lb girl the rise fine , n't want wrap around well it absorbant enough one pee ( way , make sure waterproof cover ) i n't like much bulk little absorbancy i found ( opinion ) good low price fitted diaper , green mountain diaper workhorse fitteds much better they 're made prefold , 's many layers absorbancy instead cotton filling like dappi contoured 
-1	my 10 month old soaks every diaper thought i would try thick cloth diapers , avail must sort vinyl cover go i ca n't stand vinyl covers since n't breathe that perfect environment rash 
-1	i not chance use actual diapering yet , i ca n't speak effectiveness but i wash mine , preparation , already see problem there laundry tabs velcro , two choices diaper : wash closed ( i ca n't imagine 'll get clean way ) , wash open velcro attach everything comes contact not good design , ask velcro already less durable snaps , catching laundry every time not going help durability 
-1	these not absorbent smelled bad couple uses i hate 're filled polyester instead cotton 
-1	i loved warmer first 5 months we used twice day night feedings it ( 5 1/2 months use ) picky ! most times , automatically shuts right amount water , not hot , i follow cleaning/descaling directions , water softener i also use distilled water & # 8230 ; still shuts not ok hungry baby frozen bags milk ! i market new warmer also , mention bpa free plastic resoviour basket plastic parts get quite warm 
-1	when i received item i excited finally then i unwrapped item realise shipment , one hinge completely broken cracked ready drop first possible use what good product since cap must place order heat remain inside warmer sort effective i totally dissatisfied this first item i ever received amazon state with hectic daily routines unpredictable moments motherhood bring , last thing i need deal damaged product this item useless steam obviously not sealed inside 
-1	i still using mainly timer feature [ update : i decided return month i wrote review ] i n't like water reservoir since difficult clean due small opening even trying clean every days i see black spots inside mold/mildew/gunk ? ? see pictures i uploaded i operate without reservoir i pour little water bottle warmer i need use it this could much better simply made water reservoir easy clean 
-1	i thought good purchase three months use stopped working for reason would not stay long enough warm bottle prior not working properly , would work leak terribly it waste money 
-1	this bottle warmer unreliable i ended throwing purchasing different brand 6 weeks it took forever heat would overheat milk instant boil the amount time took never day day warming bottle glass hot water effective bottle warmer time consuming just got kiinde kozii far good scorched milk unlike dr brown 's 
-1	i bought warmer good reviews i also purchased dr brown 's bottles thought warmer would better suit bottles i grant product 3 positive points : - i like fact screen lights , makes easy use night - it basically fits bottle ( i n't replace i got rid dr brown 's bottles i hated ) - i guess 's pretty much expected warmers right ? - you n't refill water every time but 's here list bad points : - there mold build-up reservoir within days no way clean and i sure mom wants see mold anywhere near baby 's food ! - not add water every time seemed like good seller point first , actually tricky us you end not paying attention water level reservoir ( especially nights ) , sometimes start heating bottle without water when get warning whatsoever , real hazard bottles , warmer , you ! - because opacity color reservoir , also presence mold , hard check water level , probably reason keep forgetting refill water - it never warms bottles evenly you shake bottle thoroughly warming avoid baby getting burnt - the plastic basket n't best pick small 4-oz bottles , get burnt time let alone baby food jars - very inconsistent : sometimes warm bottle 2 minutes super hot , sometimes 4 minutes milk still barely lukewarm i first thought inconsistency due water level , i get one really hot bottle cold one next time , exact heating time water level - the average time needed regular 4-oz bottle around 3-4 minutes : slow ! ! am i mom whose baby wo n't wait 4 minutes bottle ready hungry ? - the power cord short i like short n't need cables around kitchen , really , really short we frustrated warmer ended ordering another warmer warming bottles water bath received one i still use though , exclusively food jars , ok job , even , i already said , not easy remove jar plastic basket having 2 warmers allows prepare bottle food jar time , maybe n't that useless 
-1	ok , two stars yes time warms bottle but thing gets mold quickly 's ridiculous and mold smells , try warm bottle steam spreads stinky mold almost foot like smell we clean vinegar , set open upside dry , never leave water reservoir full still gets moldy is n't intense steam supposed kill mold spores ? is n't sterilizer uses steam sterilize ? or sterilizer ( also dr brown product ) piece junk well ? i 'm kind worried giving baby bottled warmed moldy pit i warm bottle switch dry sterilized bottle , takes time also not always sometimes water n't leave reservoir shake get water warmer i rarely use reasons , baby needs get used cold bottles it 's easier warm milk hands 
-1	this product not work i took box not sure i got faulty one 
-1	this actually second dr browns bottle warmer the first one i dropped dish water i trying clean then brought next one used 5 months the timer stopped working we would set 6 mins would turn minute my duaghter almost eigh months old i refuse buy another one i 'm going purchase cheap first years warmer since whole milk soon the bottle warmer worked great timer broke 
-1	in hindsight , i done research this product not well thought all it 's easy set simple operate there 's water reservoir side fill water set time front panel ( 2 minutes / 2 5 minutes / 3 mins whatever think right ) click start button after appointed time , machine switches off inside plastic 'shelf ' flipped put either 5oz 9oz bottles there 's timer ca n't start stop automatically the reservoir filled daily since 's quite small the led bright 's backlight ca n't see dark switching however none much issue compared operation warmer the biggest problem uses steam warm milk of course steam heat everything outside heat gets milk inside so end burning bottle ca n't touch , nipple 's scalding , caps ca n't hold we run bottle cold tap cool what milk say ? - well 's lukewarm ! - running cold water makes even cooler even turn timer , bottle touchable milk inside cold this fundamental flaw item the way designed heating element bottom warms say inch water - rather like kettle open top then bottle would get hot around milk thus warming milk not nipple , cap , entire bottle as , thing heats everything except milk nb : buy , remember undo bottle cap one turn heat pressure n't build inside we n't isue mold periodically empty water inside the reason i give 2 stars warm bottle 's contents certain extent - i 'm generous 
-1	there really reason replace bags , make way they could easily make bags dont need replaced , goes lot money soo do not buy

-1	i listened reviewers avoided sippy cups they come two-pack , nice , leak if cup laying side , liquid leaks threads cup ( cap screws onto cup ) the cap screwed tightly , still leaked after 5 minutes cup laying side , i coaster-sized puddle carpet one cups leaks , i think might quality control problems people n't issues cups

-1	i know sounds counter intuitive seem like harsher 14 month olds skin traditional baby wipes they not moisturizer i think real problem they thinner compare pampers sensitive product they fragrance free not mean smell like nothing in opinion light chemical scent like something would smell hospital not immediately familiar overall , decent wipe i would not buy i really enjoy lightly scented wipes lotion aloe built 
-1	these wipes awful they not decent job cleaning newborn son it takes many wipes get clean the worst part wipes though smell it smells like stinky feet , days using son started smell like i 'll spend extra money buy earth 's best wipes

-1	according 7th gen supposed original wipes not new ones chemicals amazon sending new wipes 's wrong wipes ! when i ordered i got new thick rough ones sodium benzoate junk ! amazon new wipes anther item get specific item supposed old ones seventh generation brought back n't order amazon fixes problem ! 
-1	i bought i fan seventh genration 's products like dish soap , spray cleaner , hand wash , etc i regret buying i so disappointed wipes there complaints:1 ) they so dry there 's not enough moisture wipe away mess , i end using twice many literally scrubbing daughter 's heiny get clean 2 ) they n't feed refillable container well they always coming apart , open lid grab re-feed though pop top not always easy squirmy 10 month old one hand ! 3 ) they thin small 4 ) they smell bad i cancelled subscribe save wipes , i never buy 
-1	these far away worst baby wipes i ever encountered the baby poop smells better wipe it 's nauseating and , thin kind dry , would fine smell n't awful i 'm getting sense reviews might cilantro type thing-does n't bother people may terrible reaction 
-1	these wipes reminded cheap , store brand wipes sell i know ingredients much better , personally i much prefer 7 generation & # 34 ; strong & # 34 ; free clear baby wipes these true word -- soft , also thin stretchy poop went right wipe hands not a fan 
-1	these pretty overpriced amount get if looking avoid chemicals baby wipes , whole foods ' 365 brand wipes much better bet also smell kind weird 
-1	my favorite wipes stock , i took gamble purchased they awful i wish i n't purchased many they small also terrible scent fragrance free not equal unscented ! the texture reminds pampers wipes except n't `` wet '' feeling , like pampers wipes may like 
-1	i bought case wipes without previously using what huge regret ! i 've tried several times always cause diaper rash i recommend pampers sensitive burts bees i hate wipes ! 
-1	these wipes not contain enough moisture really job , i not stand way smell i try use products without lot chemicals baby , lot better options wipes i definitely wo n't purchase 
-1	its alright my son hates i n't use often i usually use bulb syringe hospital you get saline taste mouth , nothing else usually comes tube i get light headed using product 
-1	just n't seem work well you suck pretty hard work and , infant would cry ( i guess painful ) it never seemed collect much mucus even though infant definitely congested 
-1	i purchased item reading many great reviews , n't work son i tried number different occasions never effective i went back bulb syringe lot success i 'm glad works well people , i n't one ! 
-1	this not work well nasal aspirator i given hospital child born , i purchased hoping would improvement i find total waste would return i n't opened box tried occasions 
-1	the thing husband i ended liking carrier color material fabric we bought carrier use infant daughter hated ! the first issue straps whoever wearing carrier not easy adjust second issue , infant really small , area bottom little legs supposed come really wide 's not comfortable leaves bad red marks skin third issue , found almost impossible put baby you needed 2 people order make work we ended returning item using 2 occassions pain we ended buying bjorn air carrier replace absolutely loved carrier 
-1	we stopped using use kanga care diaper bag instead the design n't allow one-handed opening even leave open impossible put diaper inside one handed 
-1	ok , i want love bags they super cute 's i 've learned cloth diapering efforts first , way handles make kind pain use imagine , dirty diaper hand so need unzip bag i hanging changing table if i hanging one side handle , i lift unzip holding diaper handles looped handles get way i 'm unzipping also , bag waterproof liner outer fabric shell , kind smells i 'd expect i wo n't put carpet fear 'll leach i 've decided i love kanga care wet bags they one piece fabric holds smells better the handle designed differently 's easier open hang changing table and washes/dries way quickly i leave planet wise bags hanging hours get dry i love fabric pattern bag and seems well made but i notice stray strings one seams 3 washings and 's hanging one handle full load diapers seems strap seam may much stress it 2 handles but go unzip put dirty diaper , 'd unhook one handle unzip place dirty diaper bag i 'm referring you could try maneuver diaper handles hooked onto something not wide enough opening get done without getting hands bag soiled dirty diaper i curious see holds repeated washings it 'd nice corner strap like many others i see or even two corner straps could hang changing table always zipper unobstructed 
-1	the pros : easy transport , decent size ( holds 2-3 days diapers ) , nice print n't fadedbut got something better cloth diapers ! please go look washing instructions website : [ ] please note not supposed wash wet bag diapers ( unless course wash diapers `` warm/cold '' setting would unsanitary ) you not use `` high speed washer '' `` vigorous spin cycle '' also , water pools bag drip as site states , `` you squeeze water you may want wash bag , dirty water could trapped inside may cause odors , well `` the website says tumble dry low heat during first couple months i line-dried wet bag i tried dry drier , low , it became misshapen never since lastly , attitude washing instructions page 'self-centered ' , reminding reader least seven times situations `` warranty not cover '' `` not responsible '' although must view necessary , makes uncomfortable buy products again it probable since i cloth diapering i would like conserve much energy possible washing wet bag , twice , load lukewarm water not i think ideal i already many loads diapers 
-1	for reason not contain order like use it stinks room not even full not mention fumes get drop diaper we buy freshner room we use buy babies r us , i not sure ones coming amazon made differently my next purchase bru i update i notice difference 
-1	it hides skin not aerola 's point ? if baby lets go nipple exposed 
-1	i bought impulse since teether not attract baby using texas summer - bracelet makes perspire feels sticky 5 month old baby shows absolutely interest i take let `` wrist breathe '' worn wo n't wearing it 's piece rubber like material fits snugly wrist sad say , not work 
-1	i n't know i forked money full sized sophie experience magic little guy nothing son 
-1	i n't normally write bad reviews , i item , i incredibly disappointed i purchased sophie le girafe many people gave good reviews -- supposed vanilla scented/flavored when arrived , much smaller i pictured problem however , completely reeks rubber no vanilla it 's like chewing eraser even washing son made horrible face put mouth , refuses use i n't blame , smells nasty -- like balloons latex gloves do n't buy it 's stinky waste money 
-1	my daughter 3 months old , n't work well i spaces far apart go , 's small safely fit head , yet fits inside carseat i thought i would like lot i think side pieces stuffed helpful 
-1	they seem good theory , i felt like straps carseat irritating newborns face i purchased thinking 'll cute & functional when arrived i put i realized huge ! way much stuffing & seemed uncomfortable baby : ( i took immediately & since i threw away packaging i guess i 'll save use 's older btw baby 6 weeks old 
-1	well , not never i use times daughter i n't think likes she ca n't move head around much ca n't play toys i attach teething toys car seat play 're ca n't get toys mouth : ( maybe gets little bit older i would try 
-1	i would get something without little stuffed animals they way -- push around babies face really uncomfortable little one should n't worried cute 
-1	this cup not meant , i rated daughter respond she almost hates thing i tried multiple times get drink milk water attempting use sometimes handling , ) give back , b ) dropped , c ) thrown across room i like designed since i not one drinking , i think matter she chewy top cups hard cups like drinks this thing , wo n't even touch attempts 
-1	i loved look cup 8mo trouble sucking water , conditions right the valve neat design mostly keeps liquids , awkward clean spill little every knock cup table the biggest disappointment handles , loose spin around base tries lift cup he finds frustrating , although right position handles would comfortable hold , 'd rather i hold it 's also soon liquid level 3/4 full , cup horizontal tilted backwards liquid go valve , n't like tilting head far back he success finds comfortable drinking regular target sports bottle ( straw ) , surprisingly also far leak-proof pros : - looks great- nice shape handles baby hold ( stayed place ) cons : - handles loose- valve difficult clean inside- spill little shaken- works limited angle ( little low high , slightly side , wo n't get anything ) overall , really wanted like product , using sore disappointment 
-1	i love oxo products , great quality sturdy but little one refused anything hard spout sippy cup too expensive not use , never would touch spout 
-1	update : this sippy cut lasted less 2 months the handle kept getting loose , came completely and leaked i excited get first , frustrating got rid it =====pros : *bpa-free ( never let child near plastics not bpa-free , especially little boys ) *two-handled*handles remove , convert grip-able cup*valve good , easy remove faster flowcons : the real problem handles n't snap lock place so slide around cup , sometimes covering nozzle 
-1	do n't waste money we love oxo products exception sippies we purchased multiples cups thinking 'd love plastic valve inside constantly falls , means 're opening cup multiple times snack meal time put back place or mess everywhere 
-1	i love orange , looked cool , order but:1 - leaks i 've tried everything , n't keep seal water leaks screw top on 2 - handles coming bottom looks cool , not i ca n't put sippy cup cup holder stroller , cup holder matter ca n't even `` hook '' something w handle sippy cups sometimes very poor design , n't order 
-1	i love cup used first times , easy grip , slick design none crevices many cups impossible get milk now could child , tough cups ( well , everything ) he throwing stage much likes throw things high chair , across room , couch he not set cup kind kid so noticed stopper ( not sure technical term ) comes throws goes drink cup milk , floor , everywhere we cups issue not happen even puts lot effort long arm 
-1	i good luck oxo products , not stack first , small rubber/plastic ring provides seal inside lid screwed closed it annoying habit falling cup washed i spent lot time hunting little ring inside sink without cup not seal the inner valve prevents cup leaking also easily falls contents cup it almost impossible clean properly , also nearly impossible clean inside spout properly ( the manufacturer recommend hand washing dishwasher use i always hand washed ) i initially bought impulse i looking larger capacity , i much better luck nuby soft-spout cups use three years still going strong i really disappointed purchase wish i read reviews i bought 
-1	i 'm addicted amazon i love reading reviews subsequently buying lot all i say i listened others product i really wanted love i playtex insulated sippy cups 've always amazing however , i liked idea able see much left cup oxo sippy ugh , i stuck works what i like : - it 's clear measurements i see exactly much left - it 's pretty cool looking what i hate : - the lid grooves screws really cheaply made does not feel sturdy one time 20 month old son dropped entire lid came milk everywhere - the rubber stopper/flow regulator always seems fall whatever 's drinking therefore , go fishing clean mess made leaking out i 'm pretty lenient things usually make things work unfortunately n't one this thing junk save money get something else 
-1	i 3 cups sizes used 2 year old 1 year old the cups cute i like tuck straw away twist lid , though 2 year old not untwist twist lid but cups leak alot ! if one lying 's side always puddle liquid small children n't always put cups upright and one ( pink 7 oz ) , lid comes completely dropped ! even straw concealed still slow leak it easy children drink first sippy youngest could use successfully 
-1	i disappointed quality i got dirty easily color changed fast i mean literally blue dark grey blue 
-1	my 22 month old psycho type juicy cup use this type straw likes i excited try everything great ; big size , tight lid , didnt leak , ready order less 24 hours opening , son accidentally knocked highchair onto kitchen tile - done dozens times cups except one shattered cracked i was so bummed ! i put silicone koozie would i ? it thin `` glass like '' plastic- wont work us tiled/wood floored home 
-1	we 've used many many sippy cups this one leaks everywhere i would definitely not recommend not buying 
-1	my wife i purchased one second child try we good luck tommy tippee playtex sippies past cup looked interesting & pretty good it the worst it leaks like crazy every time end major puddle highchair tray i sticking playtex tommy tippee ridiculous we n't long enough see mold/slime problem others mentioned i would n't surprised happens this cup poorly designed 
-1	i really loved look first arrived however , soon use , started showing little cracks - 1 got 4 issue within month , broke these meant toddlers infants super expensive i wouldve expected last longer actually did my daughter love lasted though - easy hold , easy eyes ! had written review months back , wouldve given positive review not recommended ! 
-1	in teaching baby drink cup , i tried different styles cup i found one large handle easily also , seemed bit trouble thick lip cup we much preferred ( admittedly expensive ) babybjorn cup 
-1	we bought 'last stage ' cup moving real thing pre-schooler as reviews mentioned , cap not hold back liquid ok , maybe little ( 10 % ? ) , not extent make difference cup dropped child anything extremely careful i saw review advises use two lids hold back liquid , , i found makes little difference ( maybe another 5-10 % ) , substantially increases cleaning work complexity using whole thing ( not mention buy twice number cups ) after frustrating week , moved clear , plexiglass , 'real ' glass ( see clarus tritan prism rocks tumbler -12 oz amazon - awesome ) , child actually lot better oxo cup will spill happen someday ? yes , likelihood , , oxo cup n't protect bottom line : child ready oxo cup , child ready real glass oxo usually makes good products , n't one 
-1	we luck cup yet my daughter n't get n't need tilt far would sippy cup order get liquid the holes top cup go way around tilts far , gets drenched it would made sense small section holes tilts cup far , solid part lid stops liquid come small section holes 
-1	my daughter uses hard spout sippy problem she also drinks adult cup long i hold help that said i lot research found great fix give cup we tried several attempts failed the problems : the lid thick rounded hard fit mouth , clear insert top high kept hitting teeth nose also i hoping tipped tiny amount drink would come bottom part , sadly blocks much liquid comes bottom sides poured face this cup epic fail my search best non toxic training cup continues 
-1	loved idea , n't really work two-year-old twins it seemed frustrate water still got dumped tried removing insert tried doubling-up insert suggested another reviewer doubling-up good idea slow flow , still frustrated kids have n't used , might try i imagine working well - depending age readiness 
-1	because leaks much openings , i n't see need product i thought product designed help mom in addition , cup fairly large toddler i ended giving son smaller , glass cup hold better 
-1	the plastic insert holes apparently supposed help control flow water , i n't think makes difference way perhaps needs option smaller holes help reduce flow water my toddler spills water much regular cup the reasons i 'm giving two stars not one remove insert 's bpa , phthalate , pvc free the oxo tot training cup looks great functionality zilch 
-1	my son even almost two years old not mature enough yet he needs leak proof sippy cup maybe would work people 's children not mine 
-1	when i ordered product , i especially excited two lids -- figured ( 14month ) son would graduate one other i n't much luck either , though the sippy cup lid insert , son drops sippy cup ( even standing height -- not far ) , insert part falls , water pours freely sippy cup then i also tried & # 34 ; bonus training lid & # 34 ; part , typical cup holes around side , intended slow flow maybe n't practice enough all i know , son getting much better going slowly regular cup , realizes 's special top throws head back like regular sippy cup lid , making huge mess 
-1	i surprised i n't like cup i love oxo tot stuff normally the sippy spout way hard handles difficult get i found another brand sippy cup worked much better baby 
-1	i got 3 year old fits perfectly car seat cup holder a bit perfect , fact , 's gotten stuck the flip lid n't feel secure enough i feel like could easily get knocked open inside backpack spill contents everywhere otherwise , i like design my 3 year old ca n't open ( yet ) 's plus 
-1	i ordered thinking i going love it ended ok i usually love oxo tots products flop it great idea would much better ziploc eco-fabric baggies everything always got smashed bag but lid fips open barely trying i liked daughter could open , closed tripped would pop open snack would go floor , defeats whole purpose putting snack something if could redesign lid bit i sure i would give another try 
-1	i originally liked design snack cup 's easy hold , nice slip grip , opening good size daughter 's tiny hands , easy open fits perfectly cup holder stroller high chair , however , using week , latch lost 's grip wo n't stay shut anymore i ca n't even keep diaper bag without popping open making mess she also dropped store snack went everywhere i much prefer theoxo tot snack disk , aquanow it 's super easy clean hate n't fit cup holder like one find way combine two i 'm sold ! 
-1	threw thing comes side pretty useless sorry lame lame 
-1	i couple sets lids n't interchangeable they hard get tight i n't trust gladware seems better lot cheaper 
-1	given high reviews , i bought spoons along munchkin ones , thinking would much better our little one n't like the rubber part spoon n't smooth , 's little bumpy , hates texture from perspective , spoon way shallow get reasonable amount foot into/onto i 'm really bummed bought my advice try munchkin ones first ( 're great ! ) 
-1	i purchased set toddler demanding fork spoon mealtimes , not want plastic kiddie ones since regular forks spoons bit large mouth , i found set well , n't like he still prefers adult forks spoons , uses success the spoon kiddie set wide fit toddler mouth , fork 's tines dull , ca n't stab anything otherwise , 're nice quality , not meeting needs 
-1	i like set least toddler silverware my issues 1 ) fork tines rounded spear food causes toddler endless frustration also not teach use fork functional way ( works like spoon instead ) 2 ) tip spoon wide toddler easily get food mouth i recommend set shaped like real silverware - pointy ( not sharp pointy enough actually use like fork ) tines narrower spoon tip my favorite oneida toddler set perfect 
-1	i 'm not fussed keeping everything sterile baby , i want separate brush bottles pump accessories , i usually like oxo products much this brush , however , hardly makes life easier pros : - pretty colors- soft gentle bottlescons : - bottom unscrews brush counter-clockwise- nipple nub completely useless ( maybe okay nipples , not really reliably clean small parts , e g medela pump accessories ) - brush sprays , matter carefully move it- less two months limited use , brush bristles starting look tangled worn- leans anything , brush gets flattened ( pretty much buy stand ) 
-1	should read reviews ordered oxo brush cleaning bottle also means gon na take soap shower : ) the bristles soft pulling brush bottle , really mess but : it clean bottles nice though lol the nipple-cleaner = useless this plastic nub not cleaning anything i ended , not using , 2 tries poor execution oxo i really like color thought - i ordered green the brush-holder works pretty good well it 's sturdy enough not falling brush sitting at least something positive brush my opinion : waste money my 1-dollar-brush gets job done actually nipple-brush works lol 
-1	i breastfeed bottles small ( since baby eats small amounts ~ 2 oz ) munchkin bottle brush better good quality durable brush , big needs 
-1	i kinda dissappointed brush it splatters water soap place pull bottle i n't feel like bristles really scrub clean and nipple brush n't brush its pointy piece rubber not sure 's supposed clean bottle nipple i like stand make sure drain water bottom tray else gets gross i 've tried lot brushes one i 've found works best & # 65279 ; the first years double sponge bottle brush its cheaper works 100x better 
-1	the head big fit standard sized bottles the nipple brush n't actually scrub nipple , i 'd envisioned mine also came different kind stand like suction cup 
-1	another waste money easier wash hand dry wish i could return item never used n't plan sorry i bought 
-1	i liked matching oxo design , stand water spout , color smart , bristle soft brush i bought munchkin kept stand 
-1	ok product ! nothing special like stand drain 'special ' thing ! good price though 
-1	after weeks , top brush became smashed n't really recovered while i expected movement bristles , i n't expect entire thing would collapse uses major disappointment i 'd rather use munchkin brush sponge end 
-1	double check dimensions 're ordering ! it 's maybe 2/3 side changing pads -- n't seem like 's adequate 12-month old also , i 'm disappointed i n't notice ca n't washed i love changing pad -- i thrown wash semi-regularly plus whenever gets actually dirty that seems requirement something touches poop sometimes ! 
-1	look larger , better padded changing pad ! this one small not padded my baby small pad still not big enough ! 
-1	this clearly n't created tested anyone truly changed babies it bulky not organized way makes sense the clear bag i guess `` wet '' area flimsy ripped us early on luckily someone else got us small portable changing pad plain pad using we using changeaway odd times change baby couch bed i think cut bags dangling right since totally pointless 
-1	when i i always diaper bag the diaper bag diapers , think change clothes , toys , food , etc when would product really needed ? i got son born thinking would nice carry around not big diaper bag i rarely used product the times i changing pad home i found product rather small useless not needed product ! 
-1	i selected changing pad purely based price ( cheapest time ) it serves purpose , i would n't purchase - i 'd go back skip hop pronto changer the mesh pouches hold diapers wipes small open inside ( baby actually mat , takes manuevering get diapers/wipes pouches ) 
-1	the cover tight difficult put tray filled it also not air tight i ditched cover use cling film the trays good shape pocket makes removing frozen food easy wished came two trays instead 
-1	i disappointed pay `` baby '' version ice cube tray find food gets freezer burn n't pop easily i suggest getting basic ice cube tray covering w/foil frozen pop store freezer safe bag tupperware would n't recommend product 
-1	unfortunatly difficult get frozen food tray it makes nice size servings baby starting eat 
-1	this tray adequate disappointing design drawbacks i love oxo products , including tot products , shame with first child i use kidco tray managed unearth gone back months using oxo here 's i not like first , lid slides easily nice , not tight fitting i use tray freezing food solid transferring cubes plastic bag , still i found freezer burn cubes the main reason i hate way lid fits run hot water back tray make easier get cubes ( helpful thing ) , water inevitably gets tray creates mess second , i wish cubes 1 oz 3/4 oz not big enough another great thing kidco tray -- 1 oz cubes third , shape cube designed press cube help i n't care design even i wash hands right , i 'd prefer not touch cubes get one could use tool i n't found convenient fourth , per , i 've used knife try dislodge cubes ( order avoid running tray water seconds i n't get water ) , i 've damaged tray the tray made pretty soft plastic ( perhaps due bpa free materials ) result using dull butter knife try pop cubes shreds it i use trays overflow kidco trays full wash they ok i expect oxo not best product 
-1	it appears useful i found i dr brown bottles wo n't fit white part i guess good wash smaller items bottles ( nipples , tops ) baby spoons 
-1	holds less i expected best flat lids , back back dirty sides had better luck plastic net produce bag knot tied end plus free purchase onions , oranges , etc plus tiny holes , even small breast pump & sippy cup pieces ca n't fall now toddler finds fascinating toy , least getting use way 
-1	i yet use product i sure people find helpful product i not use 
-1	if bottom product flat , would probably work fine however , little raised ring bottom , i 'm assuming help seal better unfortunately , n't fit tub 
-1	okay , mat not soft , matter side use , 's super thick i n't know could n't manage softer mat also , i 've learned , i 'm bathing baby tub , i tend kneel times , sit play time it would nice bit bigger mat i gone husband 's advice used one yoga mats ! 
-1	i bought one purchased one summer infant extra tall decorative gates in comparison gate flimsier pins extensions slightly undersized making gate even flimsy installed more importantly opening 31 5-32 5 '' wide find gate n't wide enough without extension wide one installed for money summer infant gate far sturdier heavy duty better opening closing system usually product great reviews amazon take bank not time check opening order fall range disappointed 
-1	i got around $ 19 99 maybe little less , ca n't remember let tell , velcro stopped working one wash i would n't recommend unless die hard winnie pooh fan , i would n't get 
-1	i bought totally 4 lunch bags ( 2 owls 1 monkey 1 ladybug ) friends ' kids gifts the 3 look great except ladybug first , different wrapping second material bag different at first i thought maybe 's older version i found last reason worst bad odor which 3 n't i would like know buyers experience and i hope seller could contact explain happening i 'm worried dishes , bowls spoons i bought fake could dangerous kids 
-1	my toddler son received monkey lunch bag gift loved it 's really adorable perfect size lunch the zipper works well , i like pocket inside his school fridge kids put lunches , i not attest insulation bag after month use , however , love bag started diminish the bag fabric , fabric n't coated either inside outside so anything moist liquid comes contact fabric soaks right fabric ca n't simply wipe clean spot cleaning not work fabric bag + young kid + food/drink = gross smellyunless time thoroughly wash bag every day ( even weekly ) soap , water good scrub - small child , i 'm doubting time or energy not start look grimy weeks , i 'm sure teaming germs average parent would find acceptable kid 's food storage system after couple months , i ended getting thecrocodile creek classic lunchbox - solar system 10 '' x 7 5 '' , spray cleaner easily wipe wet dishtowel get reasonably sanitized cleaned however , crocodile creek n't perfect either : zipper often gets hung bottom corners it might frustrating young fingers but overall , 's better choice skip hop opinion 
-1	we 've found useless it 's great idea big handles little clippers , cute ergonomic , n't clip my baby sharp nails , time 're soft bendy these clippers simply n't cut nail perhaps need sharper , perhaps 'd work older child harder nails , 're looking infant 1 year old , n't want hold get nails find rotten clippers n't work we tried multiple occasions last year use 've never managed clip nail we use tiny stainless steel pair adult clippers instead 
-1	i two sets -- first i purchased major baby chain store , worked perfectly nearly two years i loved much i ordered second set new baby the larger clippers second set useless -- blades alignment barely mash nails , failing cut -- super frustrating i finally get tiny baby sleep right position lap trim nails ! two stars i reminisce quality first set , much i love easy hold handle otherwise one star second set utterly useless i wanted large handled clippers , small set functional not much consolation ! 
-1	thought toy kind different since little one loves crawling i got push around but n't really impressed plus , i saw toys r us half price 
-1	this didnt encourage son crawl he 'd toss around entertained balls going , far baby toys go n't worth he played maybe 3 times moved it quickly donated since took lot space 
-1	i wished would worked , instead i wound completely frustrated tossing trash they kept curling falling ! maybe i trying apply windows summer , i n't wait cold get work 
-1	if 's hot outside kids not happy sitting car , instead spending money product , best thing $ 5 buy popsicle kids they happy least while this product waste money , i know 's not lot money , total waste it came tiny little square package , folded like 10 times i could never get smooth , i tried putting bed , blow drying ( readers suggested ) , putting sun reasonably wrinkle free , comes applying part well , good luck it definitely not worth effort after britax flop jeep cling mess , dropped car car shop got back windows tinted $ 100 bucks done sooner 
-1	product pretty much consists 2 tinted cling-on plastic sheets ironically not fit rear passenger windows jeep cherokee laredo ( big ) they might fit front seat windows would definitely fit side windows cargo area , i n't need when affixed glass , great effort required get wrinkles/air bubbles they also require something store not use keep clean because `` static cling '' , attract dust/debris not work properly get dirty so , may need keep window cleaning wipes hand do not expect stay windows if/when roll if roll windows , come put back i plan purchase adjustable suction-cup style shades replace 
-1	these clings , never worked they ended clinging together never performed desired i would not purchase recommend 
-1	i bought sunlight n't blind daughter traveling car the day sunshades came i excited it rather cold outside i put warm vent soften window would n't stick cold that n't much good either even warmed days later still would n't stick windows i purchasing sunshades suction cups do not waste money spend extra dollars save lot hassle ! 
-1	i purchased shade find difficult stay also not shady i thought would 
-1	when ordered hoping would save always using blanket daughters car seat keep sun face the print nice fit car seat fine ( chicco car seat ) but thought opened way could get daughter take small opening hard try get without taking , daughter 3months old 10pounds 23in long shes small baby cant imagine would bigger baby , , my advice order jj cole car seat canopy instead 
-1	it beautiful frame presentation the pad quite useful i think i would need least 4 pads get good , presentable prints , supply one i needed first time get feel product footprint not come nicely , second attempt hand came o k , not expected afterwards not enough ink prints - i e ink missing places previous print taken , looked funny i probably get ink take better prints , additional cost ( $ 8 ) also takes time order 
-1	although many extra sheets ink print , hard use we waited baby fast asleep , difficult get print without smudges i like ink never touches baby 's hand/foot , disappointment countless attempts i think probably going end buying ink pad old fashioned way as right , sitting corner , probably wo n't hanging anytime soon not easy looks 
-1	we tested bunch different brands cloth wipes , got thumbs following reason : wipe composed two layers sewn together edges when use , layers separate smeared poop on positive side , edges sewn together well not frayed curled lots lots washes the winning wipe us grovia cloth wipes 
-1	how cute thing , right ? ? i excited purchase daughter , sent instead miyim monkey baby blanket , costs less did amazon run sweet looking fellow , simply send blanket instead ? not clear i decided return blanket exchange they claim n't fault , therefore could refund however , i noticed amazon printed bar code label correct name item i thought i ordering ( fred monkey ) covered original bar code scan ( baby blanket ) hmmm if amazon contacted let know perhaps item i wanted , least refunded price difference , i might held blanket the product super cute , error amazon 's response warrants one star 
-1	we original bjorn , boys getting big heavy getting uncomfortable try carry long stretches , i thought i would try model first let say petite woman , not work i 5'4 '' 112 lbs , i could not adjust small enough fit my husband 6'2 '' 210 lbs , fit okay however , elected return bulky there much padding everywhere not even rolled fit diaper bag , seemed like even little bit warm outside baby could get overheated ( not mention wearer ) also , nowhere near easy put original bjorn , one reasons liked bjorn much begin i ended ordering becco gemini i happy , husband going keep using original bjorn ( make visits chiropractor ) 
-1	i doubts & 've listened intuition i knew immediately upon opening i 've spent & gotten material cover it holes ventilation 're small & i could n't bring use there 's something wrong encasing infant plastic i guess trapped somewhere outside heavy rain blowing directions might useful , even i 'm not sure would likely scare baby rain pounding i 'd recommend skipping product 
-1	i never used product ended throwing away i n't think enough ventilation make truly safe i know i could crazy parent i 'm not comfortable putting child 's carseat seems like large plastic bag small holes air get not happy product 
-1	i bought use burp rags i unhappy quality gerber cloth diapers i using burp rags my 3 month old spits lot while much softer gerber diapers , absorbency , least comes spit , not good the spit sits top rag instead absorbed inside not sure work diaper inserts , i would not recommend burp cloths 
-1	i purchased size two use 14 5 pound 3 month old daughter 30 pound 2 5 year old daughter first , good : seem like constructed well the cotton soft fluffs nicely washed dried several times the bad : waaaaaay long girls even 2 5 year old top weight limit , 's long lean they also far narrow , even 14 pound 3 month old forget trying snappi/pin according instructions package , using method matter they 're narrow pin , long work well trifolded cover they work trifolded but okay folding 6-8 inches really bulky lumpy diaper 
-1	absorbtion great if planning closing snappy , not wide enough i n't fat baby ( 30 % ) 
-1	i starting cloth diaper 5 month old , bought diapers use prefold diaper covers also flip organic inserts use prefolds let say like night day difference rough skin , flip soft im scared buy prefolds anymore not rough size diaper ridiculous bought size description said , yet diapers babys chest fold point r bulky cant see b comfortable not buy advice get flip organic inserts instead ( sorry mistakes nursing baby typing 1 hand ; ) 
-1	i bought daughter 16 weeks old they small narrow i difficult time trying snappi the way size 1 fit trifolding cover so i decided purchase size 2 , huge ! i n't undersatnd available two sizes , small big ! i discovered green mountain prefolds found far better fit the cotton osocozy good quality fit terrible so i use osocozy prefolds everything burp cloths lining car seat swing , even changing pad they great quality chunky baby way narrow 
-1	the snaps nearly impossible snap squirmy baby ! the velcro version cover also dud velcro sharp cut son 's legs i used wool covers loved ! 
-1	maybe people think cloth diapers fabric covers suppose leak , not case these good baby 6-10lbs leak time also inserts never dry ! dryer diaper cloths hour still wet we since switched flip covers could n't happier 
-1	i purchased item daughter i planned using put underwear sleeps ( 's currently potty training ) however arrived snaps broken i tried using n't work very unimpressed 
-1	my 7mo daughter 14-15lbs we got 6-18lb wrap barely button it 's really small 's biggest setting there elastic back , stretch whatsoever this diaper fit maybe week longer i 'm returning 're not getting paid plus color looks like exorcist vomit it 's not pretty spring green more dark vomit green the white stripes make look like boys underwear 70s i n't really care looks like much , honestly no one going see 
-1	i saw though would easy use i wrong it not bunches leaks son , big age grow 2 months i would not buy give gift 
-1	i ordered 6 , different color , baby born april , use one came broken snap top- not happy , try fix , color nice thought

-1	the lid not create tight seal thus snack go stale day and dropped , translucent top half white bottom half separates i 'm not sure not make one piece container lid 
-1	the oxo tot sprout chair high-end high chair available range colors the aesthetics build quality 'd expect it 's easy eyes made sturdy stuff but i issues design choices first , ca n't see locking mechanism table top , make sure little one 's fingers n't get crushed underneath as first-time parent , i n't know something i watch had locking mechanism along sides chair way digits , would n't issue our fisher-price healthy care deluxe booster seat take us go lock sides , 's less risk getting tender fingers caught secondly , removable pads make thorough cleaning possible sink bathtub , creases pads , well entire area underneath pads , collect lot food scraps this ends actually giving twice area 'd scrub otherwise , real daily hassle sure , tot sprout pretty high chair , 's also pain i n't recommend purchasing product 
-1	i holding buying bathtub toy holder experience always leave wanting better suction i find whale pail adequate space infant son 's squirty toys pouring cups the drainage airflow holes great keeping things getting musty the whale stayed suctioned 5 days first 'fall-down' i 've made point giving little push-back time hang scooping toys it 's fine since while i think ledge legs nifty idea , n't work tub i ca n't say well might be overall , i 'm pleased product would recommend friends little ones update 9/16/2010 : after trying use unit month half , i endlessly frustrated suction absolutely nothing i helps make stick longer couple days surfaces bathroom even n't remove pail limit jiggling holder , darn thing keeps falling down now sits sadly bathtub floor revised star total 2 experience perhaps i simply wrong surfaces bathroom 
-1	i 've several months tried everything keep secure shower wall it wo n't suction adhesive wo n't hold either big waste of money plus , awkward shape makes impossible set anywhere falls do favor n't buy it 's much easier store bath toys little dish easily set near tub awkward whale design

-1	this spray smells like rotten bananas i purchased diaper bag n't want use public smell strong fills room 're it works well enough i think plain water would work i found diaper area wash another brand works better , smells much nicer , diluted economy 
-1	after purchasing one go potty encourage daughter 's potty training , i bought one after reading reviews attracted benefit user friendly toddlers , i bought the reviews correct , seal air tight i 'm not sure i mind fact , especially leave & # 34 ; business & # 34 ; inside find somewhere empty for , i able empty right away air tight seal nuisance , not mention fact potty training daughter , hold long i pry thing apart sit use potty then , discouraging part : first words mouth & # 34 ; owie , mommy & # 34 ; well , i 'm pretty sure not two toddler booties size , assumed petite sized daughter n't comfortable so , i reluctantly gave potty daycare , many children age actively potty training well i went daycare pick daughter , found every child put potty complained hurt bottom sit i took closer look realized i would n't sit either ! no way ! it 's super hard plastic yes , i agree reviewers 's easy carry around , toddler n't feel like & # 34 ; big girl & # 34 ; & # 34 ; big boy & # 34 ; carry something themselves however comes time actually use purpose buy , product epic fail house now , i two potties i not use the best remedy i find buy plastic cover ( much cheaper ! ) put public toilets if potty training need go , i put pair pull ups over training pants you avoid stinky gross mess accident happens , still feels understand feels like accident therefore less likely cling comfort using diapers pull ups besides , wants sit mess ! my daughter come long way , product nothing perhaps someone ebay would love product , i 'll consider selling local yard sale with product , comes : if daughter n't comfortable using , wo n't meaning : i waste money especially room full potty training toddlers also refuse use 
-1	i really wanted clear plastic come older versions picture shows clear plastic however , i got cloudy plastic got mail - cloudy plastic softer n't pull well means get less milk cloudy flanges : ( 
-1	this mattress super soft - not adhere safe sleep guidelines further , labeling misleading - not fit properly pack n play there 2 & # 34 ; gap mattress edge play yard i love using organic ingredients ( hopes lower levels vocs traditional foam mattresses ) , creates safety hazards not worth risk i would not recommend product use area baby sleeps unless using supervised naps , not overnights 
-1	i unsatisfied mattress becs loud put baby rolls around i contacted vendor admit product defect will not purchasing anything vendor email response : to answer question , noise hearing put babyon mattress coils built close overlap alittle bit , please assured safety issue nothing worse losing sleep becs 3 month old waking constantly becs loud coils 
-1	these affordable `` burp '' cloths available amazon com i bought however , way small liking , i returned i n't know exact dimensions barely large enough drape shoulder i prefer burp cloths generously sized point fold half go pretty far back 
-1	so , i purchased reading reviews arrived gel pads hugely inflated air hardly gel not sure transit pads became inflated pillows elevation change , rendered product completely useless i returned product bought another breast pad : i bought `` gerber breast therapy warm cool relief 2 reusable packs nuk '' better purchase they covered light fabric , not plastic like pads you also keep cool microwave get hot : ) 
-1	they 're hard use collection long make awkward sit use shorter wider would probably easier versus tall long also numbering not black 's raised little 's hard make much 've pumped 're looking 're pumping not sure could n't use markings bottles ones come pumps 
-1	we got little one still preferred swaddled occasionally rolling stomach we hoping would prevent rolling learned use keep baby side preferred however not like restricted one place he fought time realized like idea hoped would work us probably would work younger babies we go cold turkey not swaddling real quick 
-1	my baby hated beginning i could n't find position n't curled head pushed towards belly n't like carried position i figured maybe small newborn ( 6 lbs ) , i waited 10 lbs still hates scrunches even the sling hard adjust , , i could never figure tight loose 's supposed frustratingly , instruction booklet comes non-adjustable version sling why even bother ? there instructions adjustable sling i 'd give one star , i hopes i use sling-seat kid 's big enough held hip , i may edit review time comes 
-1	not fan product the box open inside packaging box looked like returned product sent the carrier says used newborns 's much fabric swallows baby i 'm constantly fighting make sure face n't covered , i looking carrier easy use i needed get stuff done around house wanted held not carrier i try bigger hopefully work n't total waste money 
-1	we bought new grandson use bath time put kiddie pool the problem keeps sliding seems constantly pulling would work better strap seat less taught baby 's bottom would sit lower 
-1	i really looking forward seat working allow two youngest kids bathe together first , i like seat three different reclining positions it folds pretty compact storage travel but , chair serious downfalls it needs something grippy base it slides tub if son kicks hard moves around if older sister moves around much slides , really nonskid material base second , bigger pain son slips right seat he likes kick splash , moves , body kind slips it requires constantly prop back even four-year old remarked strange n't buckle seat like every baby seat thought , i 'll keep looking 
-1	my son outgrew sling last tub , still n't big enough sit yet , i needed transition tub i bought one n't much good say 1- if need fold time , i could see legs impossible fold 2- the seat bottom difficult blow 3- the air plugs seat bottom kept coming open leaking air 4- when , head rolled one side ear half head resting water 5- i see would extremely difficult clean ( even dry properly ) many folds material the good part i could see gets big enough sit , nice cushiony bottom sit sadly , i wo n't keeping long find i 'm going one nice contoured firm back 
-1	what i n't like : the size small side the bib well opening neck the size velcro part attaches velcro not match , extra velcro scratched son 's face moved bead direction the appliques attached closure part hard rough it also scratched son 's face moved , i went ahead cut one scissor the material thin side there times would literally soaked feeding after washes , material shriveled started fuzz i not see reaching bibs i use i need laundry nothing else use 
-1	i bought 5 month old son likes paci night well stuffed animal first , paci horrible way small 5 month old hold mouth would soo much better larger pacifier mam type pacifier do not wast money

-1	as heading implies , costly $ 300 mistake the pump weak hardly pumps milk my wife spends 45 minutes per session pump less 1/2 ounce we finally took st rose hospital tested we discovered pumps failed even make minimum pressure because pumps called & # 34 ; personal & # 34 ; , not refundable instead pumping ( pun intended ) another $ 300 another pump , decided rent & # 34 ; hospital & # 34 ; grade pump $ 60 per month it well worth guarantees work ! now , pumps 15 minutes gets 1-2 ounces not bad ! ! cheers good luck ! 
-1	the bag really cute great travel i cloth diaper son used bag i unfortunately bag tore wash second time i washed never put dryer yes , adorable not going last long once touch bag tell not durable i gave two stars 's cute bag guess i 'll figure fix definitely not worth money opinion

-1	this thing piece junk it n't shaped well little fingernails , n't work well get positioned right if want file little one 's nails , use baby emery board 
-1	i bought birth daughter i afraid cut cutting nails difficult get sit still i say item definitely not hurt baby 's fingers i test i use brand new newborn daughter safe but , n't seem anything trim nails i would file file would n't change for money costs , 's not worth ! i returned went back baby nail clippers 
-1	maybe i gotten younger i would n't think waste money to get results used nail quite longer baby ( probably ) hold still i got i would n't try cut nails sleeping ends would way would hold still long enough i 'm sad i wasted money 
-1	i really liked first times i used , found 4 month old baby even heaviest grit disk ( orange , i think ) takes incredibly long time get even one nail done and sometimes 's always little corner nail ca n't get on whim i grabbed emory board found works much better takes 5 seconds per nail also , battery wears 2 days even i took i finished time save $ $ buy 99 cent emory board ! 
-1	first : artificial coloring because apparently , focus group neonates decided `` caramel coloring '' essential use supplement , way , national institutes health say not even necessary mother 's vitamin d levels , something keep mind ( [ ] ) secondly : artificial flavoring again , perhaps could somehow vaguely justify base formula tastes terribad , infant needs artificial anything ? we 're trying administer single vitamin supplement are really sure artificial flavoring safe not even natural flavorings regular adult food ? thirdly : 's really expensive you find vitamin d suspended pure olive oil fraction price one online supplement places the caveat stuff careful administering one drop ( putting either pacifier nipple allowing baby suck 30 sec ) , instead filling nearly idiot-proof dropperful squeezing baby 's mouth overdose course concern ca n't handle one drop time 
-1	these expensive get i got two bottles almost price local pharmacy this rip 
-1	as soon i got used , handle broke not worth money , even though really cheap 
-1	the brush poor quality it strong plastic odor brush bends easily used clean bottles given smell lack labeling , i concerned brush maycontain compounds i try avoid , like phthlate containing pvc , etc 
-1	we 've using mattress month started sink much i put son he weighs 20 lbs i afraid soft sinking 2 stars maybe better lighter younger infants ? it fit perfectly mini-crib gaps 
-1	mine not pass authenticity tests not work we purchased hazelaid works perfectly 
-1	the case material soft , n't look nice pillow opening loose looking - would nice overlapped - looks sloppy cheap 
-1	nice soft pillowcase price i ordering third one tell something the complaint i made knit fabric , not remain rectangular my son stretches sleeping ends completely twisted ( seams ending partially middle pillow get idea ) oh , washing/drying cases n't restore shape they remain forever twisted this not affect functionality , 's less tidy looking update - it 's several months later three cases not held well normal toddler use washing none rectangular ; you ca n't even fold since stretched askew , shift around night my son gets frustrated takes this means actual pillow getting drooled night night needs washed often now pillow stuffing lumpy i 'm back online buying memory foam travel pillow i thinking maybe cases velcro , zipper snaps close open end , might solve problem removing cases constantly i 'd add buttons , i 'm afraid choking hazard anyway , really difficult cover pillow , right ? i initially really liked great bargain inexpensive however , not worth hassle get stretched twisted i 'm reducing two stars 
-1	it cute i received mail after first wash totally deformed n't look i n't recommend item

-1	i needed several washcloths toddler wipe hands meals make way bathroom , freshen outside wet towel hot summer days i thinking i would also able use second baby 's baths well joined us so , i looked 100 % cotton washcloths decided buy 2 packs luvable friends super soft washcloths these washcloths generous size , cute color , definitely get job done however , not soft the packaging indicates 're 100 % cotton , i doubt quality cotton they not hard ! i would sent back i purchased infant on minor point , i agree comments mention packaging issues , i pulled slowly n't become problem , not pull many threads out overall , i think using toddler 's hands fine , however , i would definitely not use infant , i think 're far `` super soft '' 
-1	i ordered washcloths use newborn sadly , not soft they 're small , thin regular washcloth also , packaging leaves sticky residue washcloths n't come easily laundry overall disappointed product 
-1	ca n't beat price washcloths pretty soft however , extremely thin i put washing basket wiping baby couple times ( soaked ) so buy wish , aware : ) 
-1	did n't feel great n't really use i feel like harsh baby 's soft skin so n't bother just use hands wash baby

-1	these sippy cups leak time time , especially dropped highchair the spout time consuming get back lid exact position necessary prevent major leaks happening well save money husband 's sanity get lower maintenance sippy tommee tippee better us 
-1	our son nightmare time getting liquid we tried easy see since silicone spout tough squeeze he enjoy toy teether spout bit the annoying thing dropped tile , little air release valve would always pop open water would get everywhere in addition , speech pathologists , dentists , doctors , etc recommend straws another strike sippy cup the platex straw sippy worked better us i 'm not saying best , seems work okay us it n't require biting get liquid , i would try first i could n't recommend one parent many better options 
-1	i tried soooo many sippy cups one year old twins , leak terribly ! i sticking nuk brand , n't leak ! 
-1	after using cups 2 months 11 month son discovered not completely coming clean the nipple designed four long indentations run length come dead end tip nipple spout those indentations slowly accumulate debris milk dishwasher after noticing indentations not coming clean i soak long time soften deposits spend forever bottle brush clean you may thinking i used bottle brush along would not happened however , even standard bottle brush straw brush deepest part indentations hard , almost imposable reach even i hand washing every use time would still accumulation i hate think long took notice huge design flaw many parents use without ever realizing nipples not completely clean ! i would not recommend purchasing product i tossing cups purchasing new cups if market cup i would recommend : nuk trendline silicone spout learner cupthis cup far superior design comes handles 
-1	i purchased cups hopes would encourage son give milk bottle it not however enjoy drinking water the spout soft silicone kind feels like nipple i think kids transition easier however spout cap connection finicky if clear spout anyway not flush cap leak the first times i gave son i noticed water leaking everywhere i take apart check leak coming noticed clear spout cap slightly askew when 're busy mom trying fill cups kids last thing want worry examining things my son also able bite onto spout tear whole spout cap teeth it n't break obviously made mess

-1	this cute jack-in-the box , one-year-old daughter loves however , i would advise not buy , not durable both times i 've tried jack-in-the-box , broken within days ! the first time , mother-in-law sent jack-in-the-box us gift within 48 hours normal use ( never dropped , thrown , etc ) , music cylinder somehow broke the music became garbled sounded dreadful we send back my mother-in-law also one house grandkids play again , daughter delighted play , , broke within couple days this time , crank simply stopped engaging music cylinder , jack-in-the-box makes sound , matter way turn crank even toy n't broken , i still would major complaint : latch holds lid closed easily pushed open point song my curious toddler quickly learned worked , henceforth would never wait song finish she 'd pop lid open , push closed , laugh , repeat although still enjoyed , 's not jack-in-the-box supposed work so i give toy one thumb design two thumbs durability i not recommend ! 
-1	i return music key visually , perfect not scary like jack boxes the little bear cute soft touch when turn crank , mechanical parts move smoothly it 's bad care not used sure music pleasant hear if jack box music unpleasant , pretty much defeats purpose , positives toy moot 
-1	i know every baby different , i hoping would work us i love born free bottles i wanted try pacifier well the nipple rather small daughter could n't keep pacifier mouth

-1	appeared made good quality ( sticky , would n't move 16 month old toddlers ) , however , upon peeling wood kitchen table , pulled top layer table the wood kitchen table damaged using mat 
-1	my sister-in-law two ( told i bought got much cheaper i ) i figured i would get one i n't want spend arm leg nursing cover cons : since neck part n't go end end , flaps basically cuts `` cover '' aspect halfthe neck n't stiff enough hold open see daughterpros : cheaper coverspretty printcovers something leastmy daughter 2 months old 've used twice ( i try plan around feedings ) , maybe i need practice , overall i 'm not happy i would suggest spending extra money getting better brand i 'll continue try use one i 've already paid i ca n't afford buying kinds covers 
-1	like pattern weight fabric piece top keep stiff see baby n't stiff enough n't work well unless perfect position seen better ones friends 
-1	i got nursing wrap $ 10 , i ca n't really complain cheaply made however , i one issue pose risk baby mom using wrap the hard plastic strip sewn top cover ( keeps cover open see baby ) started poking material the plastic strip made tiny plastic fibers , edges plastic sharp i poked self times edge plastic , i careful not let baby touch edge wont get poked scraped i used finger nail clippers cut fibbers , i pretty sure keep poking material since sharp it not big issue careful also , the material thin cheep there many nursing covers made much heavier , better quality fabric lastly , cover little shorter ( length width ) i would liked i not tall , i nurse , i would like fully covered even though job , times i feel like angle 's not covered well i would like be on positive note strap around neck adjusts really well , design color elegant , neutral pattern i used cover nine months , job however , many nursing covers much higher quality i getting new one next baby 
-1	the clasp cheap n't stay kept coming undone i stopped using found ways cover creatively 
-1	after obly 6-9 months monitor stopped picking sounds over course two weeks got worse worse completely useless we could hear baby crying pain room not monitor customer service waa okay they little slow respond though they said new nursery unit fix sent us replacement however , even nursery unit replaced srarted cutting within week for audio monitor not cheap i wish i gone cheaper brand i could replaced almost three-fold worth

-1	i 'm going buck trend here these bags cute stylish they effective want reduce usage plastic baggies i like zipper not velcro they good job , part , containing foods , although , 're trying store something juicy ( like cut oranges ) , might pushing luck moisture gradually seep seams make fabric outer cover damp if things 're going use dry snacks like crackers cereal , 're probably fine wiping interior damp cloth use and week throwing laundry `` deep cleaning '' but using anything going leave residue ( juicy fruit , oily chips , pbj sandwiches , get idea ) really not practical turning inside wiping interior n't get clean enough you load laundry ( people n't laundry every day ) hand wash submerge soapy water , fabric outer takes forever dry so really end buy 2 day supply rotate want use everyday and relatively expensive , buying several might cost-prohibitive some also , outer fabric , cute well fabric so stain making cute bag not-so-cute anymore also , fades shrinks little , bag n't lay nicely not huge deals , worth mentioning your kids probably wo n't care if looking buy kids , i would instead go thebumkins reusable sandwich snack bag , yellow , largeorbumkins 2 count reusable snack bags , blue/green , small they half price itzy anyone used amazing bumkins bibs , material they breeze wash , dry super fast i 've never hold stain the prints loud garrish , kid likes fine much practical busy moms ( dads ! ) i snack happened bumkins bags , i reach bumkins every time 
-1	i not impressed arrived 'brand new ' packaging , yet i opened large stain you ca n't even miss ! i yet see wash that said , soft colours gorgeous i hope n't fade wash 
-1	i tried daughter n't find toy amusing n't use teethe the toy seems nicely made easy pick 's not crazy 
-1	i bought baby teething unfortunately , n't interested however , 2-1/2 year old loves play ! ah well i 'm thinking 's textures teething part toy n't thrilled maybe smooth 
-1	i really want love bottles i 've used children i like caps inserts they work great except n't screw tight i suppose 's part less gas babies tummies vent however , n't put nipple right make sure parts completely dry ( difficult since i wash fill mine every night ) n't get good seal lid pretty much comes right i 've lost many bottles precious breast milk i 'd love give recommendation better brand , i never tried another since i much invested the best i say breast fed babies took 
-1	real nappies 6-pack snug wrap diaper covers , white , newborn size , babies 12 weeks , 6-13 lbthese gift amazon baby registry baby # 2 i cloth diapered baby # 1 well , i 'm not new these covers seemed work fine first we issues trying keep away umbilical cord stump would rub the leg holes also pretty tight comparison waist i get waist fitted well diaper tight legs leaves red marks all reviews i read say leak issues i constantly getting wet spots clothes , bed lays bit i washing properly i know put diaper correctly avoid leaks i think sandwich pul causes wicking honest it n't make much sense , i n't see sandwich pul ever good idea 's not like pul ever touches baby 's skin diaper all sandwich pul soak pee makes use cover good maybe , maybe 2 changes need new cover , not case regular pul diaper covers could use one day i also noticed covers seem not necessarily leak seep moisture right whole cover his whole diaper feel slightly `` damp '' that 's last thing i want worry , changing outfit nearly everytime change diaper getting frustrating what issue , make mad ! we use flats secured snappi covers my son 3 weeks issues nearly since day one using not sure i bad covers i would not recommend anyone i rate 2 stars could definitely worse still great price , i feel least experience get pay product contacted real nappies customer service going send 6 covers great although inquired i washing detergent i told detergent i using basically told issues natural , chemical free detergent vegetable based soap the directions detergent real nappies website use chemical free laundry soap that i using , manufacturer wary vegetable based soaps need clear concise safe n't all diapers fine detergent bumgenius , thirsties , rumparooz but maybe thats higher quality diapers even used i diapered daughter the real nappies newest diapers i ones leak wash routine i have i glad going replace i not happy seemed point blame leaking issues 
-1	these covers not efficient each diaper change constituted new cover would get soaked her pants would wet ! i went real nappies website disappointed read i & # 34 ; wrecked & # 34 ; not washing properly so i swallowed pride stripped that n't change anything i realize n't i bought new covers ( thirsties ) i yet strip ( using 5 months ) 
-1	i 'd say n't waste time just buy adjustable covers thirsties blueberry they worth money 
-1	our baby diaper rash stopped using real nappies cloth diapers together the real nappies great keeping poop pee , baby went pee poop much ( sometimes every 3 minutes ) first 0-3 months , cloth diapers n't work since n't wick away wetness we also n't use real nappies baby 's umbilical cord fell would contact umbilical cord using cloth diapers also makes bottoms outfits tighter since puffier 
-1	my baby n't like swaddle i rather use cotton blanket 
-1	this product would gotten 4 stars order not screwed make matters worst daughter n't like swaddled means i could never use product i received wrong color pink 
-1	i thought would great easy alternative swaddling blanket - not the velcro pain much velcro 's next impossible get straight to , i 'd get non-velcro swaddle blanket stick blankets , i ended 
-1	baby outgrew small/medium size ( 7-14 pounds ) little 12 pounds , really wanted buy product , i would recommend going size 's borderline weight also fabric thin 's cold , wo n't enough warm baby alone only thing i like foolproof wrapping/swaddling cant mess lol 
-1	with extra-squirmy one month old , product n't helpful her arms could easily move , would get caught contorted positions , would make mad wake the velcro , title reads , not helpful i thought it nice make easy swaddle stays put , baby would often scratch interior piece velcro , also woke made mad , not mention little scratches broke heart see ! when worked , would work great , times n't work greatly outnumbered times and times worked really attributed infant choosing not wiggle much certain nights probably great product much less wiggly baby not great high-maintenance wiggler like mine 
-1	the idea nice : an one swaddle baby ca n't get in practice though , falls short several areas : - my baby free hands less minute sometimes kick bottom part swaddle pretty tight - the velcro really loud wakes , defeats purpose tight swaddle comforting and sticks everything washer/dryer - multiple sizes mean 'll need buy bigger ones baby grows a swaddle blanket one size fit much economical 
-1	my son would try move arms get stuck uncomfortable positions also , process trying move arms , swaddle would come face nose ( could cause suffocation ) i never used - waste money ! 
-1	very disappointed product it thin , wo n't warm enough 70 degree room temperature quality not good either 
-1	we rocker upstairs bouncer downstairs my daughter much preferred bouncer rocker ( swing ) now daughter 18 months wants sit rocker , also wants climb , making unsafe she chairs n't try one thing i preferred bouncer could pull toys played music 
-1	i five different bouncy seats twins not favorite it okay took much room you get smaller fp one light activity bar music price i would recommend lighter smaller fp monkey seat

-1	my son 3-5 months really liked mat , i found things i dislike like it the reasons i give gym 1 pros : - lots places hang toys- very easy take apart wash matcons : - the hippo hangs low heavy ( i compensate putting hangs feet kicks ; scared head ) - the three monkeys useless except maybe teethers ( ca n't securely attach gym without falling scary fall head ! ) also extremely heavy- the stuffed elephant really cute , soft , not helpful tummy time ( touted ) - it takes alot room n't pack nicely ( disassembled put away - leave pretty much time- i really hate 3 supports , instead 4 since circular , edges roll top layer fabric gets bunched - would fixed 4 supports - also , 3 supports , figured ( 6 months old ) could kick support beams , able knock - onto himself ! ! he looked like baby burrito , i worried could suffocated , i n't see ! ! hope helps decide buy not i say n't waste money , get play mat 4 support beams ! !

-1	5 stars- really ? just received stroller today mail - disappointed - 1 handed pushing ? i n't think so - child tray not flip open- bench seat lock place - difficult fold- seats not well padded , i understand bench front seat softer - the canopy makes loud clicking noise ever moved anyone else 's canopy really loud ? did i get defective stroller ? - handle bar high , wish adjustable ( i 'm 5'2 ) if anyone suggestions add something lower handle ( reverse handle bar extender ? ) would awesome 
-1	we bought 2y old 7m old here 's bad : this stroller not lightweight opinion once put thing together , heavy , big not easily stowed back suv ( honda crv ) - 's pretty long cumbersome the handle really high stroller would better suit someone 5'10 & # 34 ; i 'd say the seat back not comfortable son bc 7m old needs seat front slightly reclined , puts bar right back 2y old sitting back seat the canopy ca n't cover - pick one shaded ! the basket seats technically access sides stroller , thing put way bottle water get ? the brakes not easy apply - really put pressure lock the front seat huge - daughter swimming i ca n't see could safely put 3m old stroller , lowest age advertised the maneuverability n't great either the good : very easy assemble sturdy 's probably perfect 2 toddlers toddler young child easy fold easy unfold price great double we really wanted like stroller 's not us this better suits someone older babies tall n't need load car daily

-1	our baby cried immediately ! babies encouraged look around hold heads - like developmental step back 
-1	tried burp clothes 5 months gave , rough baby skin u wan na use burping fine n't wipe poor baby face 
-1	i purchased cloths decal gave chance considering lower reviews what waste money 1 ) the cloths narrow , honestly wo n't keep majority shoulder even length hand covered,2 ) the material absorbs like terry washcloth , when son dribbled , even slightly , i wiped clean , i fold cloth afterwards put knot-it bag would n't dirty anything touched my son projectile vomiting stage cloths become obsolete my use occasional one time use basically , forget staying dry cloths i love luvable friends , items usually fairly priced , reliable cute cloths not worth price detergent 
-1	these cute serve purpose but thin , i doubt absorb much used but nasty burp rags tend get fine short time i sure 
-1	cons : -very thin if baby spits pretty much soaks right i always `` double '' even use them -cheap material , scratchyi bought cheapest burp cloths amazon now i know -- cheap ! it 's not worth , considering i never use ( i would rather extra load laundry good burp cloths ) i i use 2 together and i really hate extra load laundry newborn hands , i 'd rather ( buy better burp cloths ) use

-1	good thing product soft nothing leaks milk not stay inside bra i not recommend 
-1	i bought cheaper brand i soon regret they not absorbent ! my nipples get stuck i peel its like ripping band-aid i suggest lanisoh medela nursing pads 
-1	i tried nursing pads nuk , lansinoh medela i feel one worst quality it thin ( duh ) resultign many leaks , amd adhesive n't stay place the sides also rough not comfrotable skin it creases visible yoru clothing it cheapest i bought invest money better ones lansinoh medela skip one !

-1	very cheaply made compare brand , could not even call breast pads very thin , thin not absorb leaks they call breast paper i ordered 2 boxes , used 2 had go buy another brand i lots breast milk , not good i think lasted 20 mins milk leaks out i always love nuk products i not understand made pads like it not good product 
-1	ok , i 'm editing review months started leak lot , almost time really annoying two hungry babies feed try feed milk dripping place they work great medela pump i used get 9oz breast mornings bottles trick just get lid put fridge for feeding though , i would say short term use , traveling put diaper bag ok but planning using time get better bottle this first review : -these bottles great they really basic i like shape , tall thin , makes easier put diaper bag we avent , evenflo ( glass ) , tommy tipee avent far favorites the price makes product fantastic purchase we soon going grandma 's short trip i ordered set n't bring bottles us if n't cheap probably would n't

-1	we bought seat elsewhere five months ago until today ( needed taken apart cleaning ) happy seat today son vomited numerous times couple minutes our first baby car seat chicco infant seat grew vomited seat i easily able take apart , wash put back together no recaro seat you ca n't take fabric piece goes ( combined back head rest ) taking rest fabric around piece nightmare the vomit everywhere , seat , ridiculous cheap foam pads bottom back ( today i realized foam pads weirdly discolored got sick ) the instructions also say hand wash old seat machine wash hang dry i actually hose seat get clean hose back portion ( slides provide cushion sides head ) would n't come i could go get idea it 's sitting garage still drying four hours later thankfully live warm climate ( texas ) i able hose - cold weather state i ca n't imagine i could cleaned seat after incident today i wish bought different seat fingers crossed i 'll able get cover back seat foam pads head eventually ( ? ) dry 
-1	bought baby 's stroller elastic broke two weeks and not overuse either , hanging , still young pull 
-1	i ordered bee crinkly wings when i received toy wings not crinkly i 'm not sure i got defective one description incorrect the toy well made without crinkly wings 's pretty boring i returned 
-1	first `` colors vary '' horrible idea baby items i got hot pink ones cupcakes mail son i n't feel like going though whole hassle returning amazon i went target bought right color returned pink ones target i not like plastic ring pacifiers without bull-nose ring attached velcro making ring choking hazard i 'd rather purchase dr brown ones 
-1	i excited find carrier ! reasonably priced , adjustable either parent , adjustable growing baby , not girly n't scream & # 34 ; made boy parents delusional ! & # 34 ; however , sucks it 's bad posture , bad back , 's bad baby , 's uncomfortable , i feel like 's not safe i not life get straps adjusted tight enough i n't hold onto baby carrier- , frankly , defeats purpose using carrier it okay 're simply walking standing around support baby- i used fair half hour i certainly would n't recommend longer that i bought holding daughter even 5 minutes causes great amounts pain discomfort back ; shoulders back get tingly feel like 're buzzing continues becomes unbearable this no way helped it ease little short periods time i held 
-1	this carrier not provide optimal positioning the baby 's hips spine not correctly placed , causes him/her dangle puts pressure hips there much better options ! infantino also makes mei tai , works much better usually less expensive anyway 
-1	for baby carrier , say get pay for i like mothers always scouting cheap good deals i come across carrier amazon i search good carrier newborn i heard good things popular ergo baby carrier student ( mom ) , i live budget i not afford $ 100 sling ( thought ) i super elated i found infantino baby carrier fraction price moderately good reviews i purchased without second thought however , i say baby carrier served well , newborn baby not much newborn anymore she 7mth old baby weighing 17lbs we still using infantino carrier stroll grocery run walmart we didnt think much husband keeps complaining back pains we realized carrier actually hurting back much constant back pain next day carrying baby 30 mins my advise looking carrier baby less 15 lbs , maybe good buy but looking long term ( back pain surgery 10 years time ) worth spend $ 100 save surgery future we purchasing first ergo baby carrier today welcoming way happier baby , happier mummy daddy 
-1	overview infantino swift baby carrier : - easy safely securely get baby of - causes horrible back pain matter i adjust straps i also bought used baby bjorn , one not hurt this one painful 's difficult communicate - back pain starts immediately putting i n't even get 15 minute grace period comfort - looks bad baby 's hips according info international hip dysplasia institute 's website - small , still bulky carry diaper bag it would take entire big compartment diaper bag i got carrier i went local baby depot unboxed tried different models carrier i felt comfortable getting baby safely without fear dropping baby the snaps easy fasten unfasten one handed they click snapped place , i hear snap connected there 4 straps hold carrier seat place one strap permanently fastened - strap goes baby 's leg side waist putting baby 's foot strap crotch carrier hardest part getting carrier once , side waist secured first velcro , snap this double check fastening good , i take , makes easier unhook one handed always keep hand back the two snaps go baby 's arms since getting , i 've gotten comfortable holding baby , 's easier get carriers entire front unsnaps , first , definite comfort level one front part could n't unsnap i never felt like i would drop baby carrier the biggest drawback carrier positions legs badly small baby the international hip dysplasia institute drawings website baby 's legs hang baby carrier for child 6 months , legs supported along thigh , n't droop gravity the website group drawings legs hang healthy carrier legs hang carrier bad hips when i looked baby carrier mirror , legs hung look like bad hips carrier picture i showed husband pictures international hip dysplasia institute website , n't show captions , picked bad hips picture from reading , baby 's legs sagging tend cause problems underlying hip weakness however , often underlying weakness wo n't diagnosed something like carrier causes come , remain undiagnosed the consequences include bad hip arthritis child grown old , not old might think - maybe 50s when i put baby cloth diaper ( bulky crotch ) put carrier , legs n't sag badly , midway bad-for-hips picture good-for-hips picture but also cloth diaper , notice cry soon diaper wet , less convenient wearing baby public i use disposable trips house plus , cloth diaper n't appear provide enough thigh support , better not good the thigh support hip health issue bigger concern , carrier 5 25 pounds so , 's geared towards small babies - 6 month old babies vulnerable hip injuries the next biggest drawback carrier aching back try i might , i could n't find strap adjustment back not killing 8 minutes the pain starts immediately gets worse after three weeks , i bought used baby bjorn original , one much much comfortable it 's like night day overall , low cost baby carrier safe easy get squirming baby , terms dropping plan use sparingly save back baby 's hips , use see whether not like baby wearing if like baby wearing , get hip healthy baby carrier ( also try check comfortable getting baby , dropping baby much worse hip issues ) 
-1	this carrier awful i bought i knew kind carrier safe baby i put started crying instantly it uncomfortable parent well , i 'm assuming baby it & # 34 ; crotch dangler & # 34 ; awful if 're going baby wear , invest something comfortable and baby cheaper not better please n't buy ! ! ! i wo n't even give mine away fear someone use hurt baby 
-1	i put carrier baby registry seemed simpler use many wraps slings newborns , 's quite inexpensive , as turns , carrier super-easy use , i 'd hoped - 's wondering ( wraps ) get thing 's right however , baby arrived , i found ease wearing product little value outset , since i could n't use carrier first this product ca n't carry newborn position feel comfortable - newborns n't like legs stretched like carrier requires our baby fussed cried whole time carrier first tried in terms positions carrier hold baby , 's suitable baby months old once baby comfortable not legs tucked , i excited use carrier , point , 15+ pounds , i found i still could n't really use - become heavy comfortably carry product , distributes weight shoulders upper back i pretty strong back - i deadlifts second trimester pregnancy , i never aching back pregnancy pregnancy could n't hurt back , carrier kills ! i could n't stand wear baby 20-30 minutes time even wraps tend better job distributing baby 's weight since i could n't use product stage baby 's development , i n't think product worth even modest cost even stand back-killing engineering carrier , i 'd discourage using , since ( i found fact ) , carriers baby basically hangs crotch n't good baby - carrying baby position potentially cause hip dysplasia to avoid risk , 's better carrier kind seat pocket , holds baby knees level hips if want wear baby , 're better putting little time figure use wrap still newborn spending money good ergonomically supportive carrier , comfortable baby parent , baby bit bigger if 're looking something carry newborn , try moby , slingling , maybe ergo infant insert even i finally able figure use moby like ! the slingling may also option want something really simple use , though 's not quite comfy two options i 'd recommend ergo beco starting baby 4-6 months old 
-1	have trying different carriers saw price could n't believe carrier could cheap well , , 's not worth looking good carrier comfy keep baby good , healthy position not hanging well , get i mean ( look pics showing body position ) especially front-facing-out position , awkward the baby 's weight moving away , 's like pulled forward this also nothing back after 20 minutes , i 'm really feeling back i tried adjusting things seems best position baby facing apparently , supposed better little babies anyway , facing n't allow baby able turn away/into get overstimulated well , i could carry baby-facing-in position longer , little longer also , baby really red diaper area afterwards , lot pressure ( ca n't comfortable , know ) in opinion , many better options if facing option , get beco gemini yeah , 's money , baby seems much happier ( may carrying position like 're seat , not hanging ) back n't kill 20 minutes we tossed infantino lesson learned 
-1	this poorly designed baby carrier 's uncomfortable wearer bad baby this carrier uncomfortable person wearing babies weight pulling wearers shoulders when looking baby carrier look one waist belt help distribute babies weight wearers hips carriers waist belts much comfortable wearer ( hiking backpacks waist belts ) the carrier bad baby babies weight crotch legs held close together hips knees straight bad hip development according international hip dysplasia institute unhealthy position hips infancy cause contribute development hip dysplasia dislocation the healthiest position babies hips baby seated position legs spread thighs supported if want stick infantino brand union balance carriers would much better options they waist belt help distribute babies weight also hold baby optimal position hip development the infantino sash infantino ecosash also good options although carriers tie instead buckling even better options would beco butterly , the beco gemini , ergo ( original , organic , options , sport , performance ) , boba ( original , 2g , 3g ) , babyhawk oh snap these high quality carriers comfortable safe baby wearer 
-1	i would not recommend it 's awkward , n't distribute weight properly , n't support baby i purchased lillebaby carrier love the lillebaby pricey , case , , i got i paid 
-1	it bad feel i know 's priced low i probably 've expected , i n't like material almost plastic like it works fine , i prefer cloth like material baby going strapped 
-1	i bought i first child it served purpose , uncomfortable baby carrier i ever worn my husband also hated complained he bodybuilder i athletic build it n't distribute wait well pulls back oddly well putting weight shoulder straps it rubbed skin matter adjustment used it worst , i said : you get pay ! this time around opted nice beco 
-1	i got baby carrier put son sleep without carrying arms the straps uncomfortable puts lot weight neck using carrier my son 3 months old back i feel n't comfortable sit after taking , whole back would hurt uneven distribution straps weight carrier i n't recommend product 
-1	i liked first i admit i bought cheap i tons research baby carriers i wanted something front carry ( facing facing ) back carry i added beco baby gemini amazon baby registry , one bought so try save money , i bought thinking would comparable it not i 've used front carry , facing you wait baby head/neck control switch him/her facing my baby point , i barely use infantino flip painful seems uncomfortable daughter the padding near top clip actually rubs/digs cheek if i make straps clip looser , seems insecure after wearing 10 minutes , shoulder killing the padding leaves lot desired i found i could easily put though ; clip back piece `` dive '' carrier ( put head , put arm ) it much faster moby wrap friend gave it beats lugging carseat stores my baby plus carseat ( graco snug ride 35 ) heavy 's getting older ( 's 14 lbs ) i broke bought beco baby gemini i tried ergo baby ( original ) baby box store the straps amazing , i really want able option wear baby facing outward ( ergo baby carriers not allow ) i always bring back facing inward overwhelmed , tired , wants nurse , etc you really get pay if n't plan babywearing , n't plan baby wearing long , if want wear baby often , spend money something better ; n't waste 
-1	i not new baby carriers since daughter born july i owned 2 moby wraps ( great ) , 2 slings 2 different infantino 's i got one babies r us daughter 4 5 months old i loved i used front fine however , tall beginning arms go straps not safe , since facing n't move much , fine my daughter 8 months old 20lbs i think back going break she also pushes see around worries arms n't fit straps i make sure keep hand yesterday i tried wear back , thinking would take pressure , life i could n't figure you really need partner help i even put like i normally tried slide back worked , took lot time once , i n't feel like secure enough i watched videos youtube n't working i ordered ergo i 'm really hoping better results 
-1	i never dissapointed baby product ! it worth 's cheap price my son uncomfortable - every time i put hi carrier , would scream ! it incredible complicated put baby it not sturdy belts came lose i put baby it not adjustable fit babies different sizes my son 18 lbs taller side , i put arms shoulders top , else squeezed inside harnessess cutting shoulders the list goes i say i truly dissapointed product it better shell $ 100 product worth investment , instead trying go cheap one 
-1	we returning - went baby bjorn original instead this stiff uncomfortable us 
-1	we ergo inward facing wanted something outward facing , hoping not spend big bucks bjorn thought i would try , given inexpensive cost its not worth it as far baby carriers go , bit complex numerous velcro snaps its way complicated ergo , pretty similar bjorn terms `` hook ups '' however , means rocket sciencethe biggest drawback comfort/ergonomics all weight shoulders the lumbar support comfortable , means provides support after 13 lb infant 20 minutes around house , shoulders already getting tight i 've worn ergo 4 hours , n't problem all i also thought front facing option , front carrier bit tall ( even fold ) my 24 inch baby 's face n't clear front yet moral story spend big bucks your back/shoulders thank 
-1	this first experience crib soother on positive note , setup extremely simple there 's strap fastened around crib safety string sorts used backup ( i think ) it important note plastic buckle secure since requires hands attach remove no infant/toddler would able release buckle the soother three different settings - light show , music nature sounds movement the light show consists firefly 's gently fading red , green , orange red lights there two musical settings , one nature sound setting four different insect motions ( 2 bugs flapping wings , inchworm inching frog hopping ) the light show movements operate conjunction music/soothing nature sounds however , motion not work independent 2 features ( sound/lights ) there two major drawbacks i see the first noise makes motion setting the noise really n't soothing i would call cranking sound anything we rarely use setting matter fact , time used 3 year old adjusts settings entertainment our baby , hand , little startled noise the second drawback soother requires 4 c batteries i n't used enough see long last , 's still lot battery power little get machine my guess requires much juice crank motors `` move '' fireflies around night sky pros : cute , whimsical designbrightly colored bugs catch child 's attentiondifferent settings allow combinations motion , lights sound3 sound settings ( low , medium silent ) cons : cost - much get , looks like many gotten hint dropped pricesbattery requirementsmotion setting makes noise not soothing , means 's really sound lights machine less desired music qualityoverall , i would say disappointed product while promise creating relaxing baby retreat sounds great , product fell short delivering promise 
-1	got son 3 months plus doesnt take much space my son doesnt really get entertained 5 - 10 mins maybe 15 i keep view mirror if music 'd better 
-1	arch comes easy flops when arch comes really really hard put back this thing pretty much useless 
-1	i bought containers thinking 'd great supplement oxo nuk baby food storage containers ( make store baby food bring back forth daycare , use lot containers ) and great -- after one washing virtually none lids ever formed strong seal matching container i 've given tries even discovering lids n't stay -- containers use -- time result baby food yogurt spilled inside baby 's lunch box i think issue cup units warp whatever reason , n't buy there much , much better options 
-1	i disappointed masher bowl the masher plastic - n't expect mash anything skin ( beans ) meats either it works fine bananas , avocado , etc , i 'd rather use fork bowl ( lid - one n't ) the holes masher small far apart , food gets kind pushed around rather broken it would much useful metal the non-slip bottom bowl nice , side grip small impedes ability really mash things the design cute overall , though , n't work 
-1	i froze rice porrige tray , almost impossible take ! not frozen liquid stuck silicone , due soft material , frozen liquid buldged middle tray , making impossible pop the way take frozen food tray flipping cup inside , took considerable amount force time ! i wanted like product safe material free bad chemicals , end day , practical 
-1	ok i thought much bigger i guess fault not reading description better so money get two small tissues err & # 34 ; security blankets & # 34 ; seriously could call one tissues blanket now company make wonderful much bigger swaddling blankets more i looking 
-1	this definitely not fit every stroller , n't fit quinny moodd , zapp umbrella considering shipping cost send back i wish i would 've spent $ 20 thru quinny extra holder very inferior cheap looking , n't able tighten enough stay upright soon place drink , holder tips forward weight drink serves purpose i 'm early 30 's usually happy not critical items , even i rig work properly one first bad product i 've encountered using site 
-1	okay nothing great cup holders small looks cheap , feels cheap and importantly i ordered blue organizer boy they sent pink one wrote back trying get touch seller , neither amazon , seller paid heed there better organizers market dont waste time money

-1	pretty expensive 3 day use , n't help , yes feels bit cold applied , like , 3/4 second , i n't know , n't make difference , n't help , i 'm not sure point 
-1	these not hold shape longer one day , although provide relief i prefer soothies multiday use 
-1	i liked idea strap sticks surfaces not cause damage however , 16 month old able open strap clicking open end ( white box without button ) not fixed belt i believe quality white box poor if plastic open/close mechanism better quality put buttons ends , would much difficult open 
-1	within one year , 3 4 broken we able use last one still i sure matter time plastic band breaks do not waste money at first seem great break ! 
-1	i ca n't believe anyone received product , would give praise it cheaply made , design looks like work , plain n't the ones purchased installed [ according directions ] lasted one pull 18 month old daughter laying floor all wife i could look laugh , else something bad , besides returning , 
-1	well clips way hard undo cause much fuss also glue faulty ! once son figured grabs straps pulls pulls right drawers 's rendered useless ! great idea poor craftsmanship 
-1	i 14 month old i carefully read reviews product purchasing i ensured surfaces clean dry installing let sit 48 hours using this product seemed work fine first weeks , falling every cabinet drawer house , breaking different places ( junction clear & white plastic , adhesive pads joined cabinets ) also worth noting ssing toilet lock not work day two very disappointed i ordering several alternatives try do not waste time product 
-1	i 'm kinda lazy these looked like would easy install ( ) prettier type looked worky these looked ugly picture , since i 'm willing admit i 'm lazy , i decided i n't judgmental they look even worse real life , though i problem adhesive coming , issue reviews raised i let cure full 24 hours using well applied much pressure i could first installing whenever i thought walked they stuck certain our problems not really intuitive take practice activating one handed , common need trying access cabinets once get hang 's not overly complex like anything else , becomes easier muscle memory kicks visiting relatives annoyed though , mild irritation always amuses , may not consider guests frustrated plus especially helping put away dishes throwing trash bigger minor issues 2 8 installed broken latches whopping 25 % failure rate -- not accounting several almost never used one failed all-important sink cabinet gets use messiest treasure baby get into i reluctantly ordered i imagined would tiny-screw-that-just-won't-cooperate-and-ends-up-bouncing-accross-the-floor-and-rolling-under-the-dishwasher-causing-me-to-scream-in-fury-toward-the-clouds-type : http : //www amazon com/gp/product/b00ady35go/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_5to lazy delight super easy install , use n't look like hot mess i wish i got ones first skipped straps entirely 
-1	we got half dozen secure kitchen cabinet doors 1 year old the adhesive good far stayed the lock also practically impossible infants/toddlers open my problem 2 already broken the plastic strap broke right connecter way fix it snapped came the plastic bit rigid hence 's breaking easily in opinion design good could gone less rigid plastic strap , even rubber/fabric strap would 've worked feb 2013 - update 1 : i ordered replace broken plastic straps keep breaking great product ruined poor quality material jun 2013 - update 2 : now tired replacing every time plastic strap broke i 've found workaround i used extra shoe laces lying around folded two , cut right length used place plastic straps you use filler ( tape ) tie knot hold place inside connector works great fear breaking , ever ! 
-1	sorry waisting consumers ' time , i feel need say publicly -i put wish list , price raised over 140 % next day i not purchasing item it 's lousy sales technique , 's lousy amazon permit 
-1	i bought 2 packs , since traditional cabinet locks n't work cupboards drawers first , getting fit right pain stuck either would n't budge ever ( course int places would liked move ) , fall right second , plastic strap broken 2 these not worth money , hassle false sense security 
-1	my 9 month old deterred week opening drawers some adhesives stopped sticking clip function stopped working holding clear plastic piece place i small baby strong enough pull straps apart 
-1	my daughter quickly figured open it sometimes n't lock well disappointing 
-1	this product stuck 1-2 days peeled , not surface i stuck ( refrigerator glass doors fireplace ) the sticky surface broke away freely plastic piece attached way due strain stress placed use do n't buy this product is a total waste of time and money

-1	this cover i could find size changing pad while fits , 's not comfortable fit it make pad buckle , happens pad thin , 's fits changing table i would recommend manufacture not make elastic tight , elastic corners ends sheet 
-1	i using diaper 2 months i 'm definitely not impressed the laundry tabs n't stick resulted velcro snagging stitching lining i contacted company said someone tots bots factory would respond month ago i 've never heard back and overall i n't like minky lining it 's not stay-dry feeling fleece micro suede , holds stink much worse my son one efb babies poops week , 's massive stinky poop i rinsed multiple times washing still stinky it took 10 washes extra rinses get stink i 'm disappointed i expect diaper expensive plus prints super cute i wanted buy

-1	bebe dubon bottle nipple brush sponge tip , colors may vary it 's really bad quality head tail breaks times using not recommend 
-1	the blue sponge top best material ever super soft , durable high quality sponge but handle broke almost immediately i disappointed we gone many similar brushes breaking we soon got blue avent brush 's working ever since best brush market never breaks 
-1	i purchased product i pregnant but time baby grew , i tried put rise snap n't work the diaper completely useless obviously n't inspect products send , 
-1	i bought i actually disapointed i love ergo i thought going something really cool wouldnt get wet pretty much shoulder strap pad save self $ 10 go buy car seat shoulder strap pads walmart 
-1	i realize product work everyone , i honestly believe n't work us due design not daughter 's preference a minor issue girth jar , seems little much small toddler handle comfortably , although silicone grip helps the main problem though , lid the opening recessed , rest lid flush top which means , tip cup enough dribble ( i mean dribble , final complaint air vent ineffective water n't flow fast enough ) flush portion lid bumps child 's nose which means tip head way back order avoid squashing little nose waiting water drip mouth i payed ( opinion , ridiculous ) price cup i thought would provide natural transition open cup , watching daughter try use showed 's not case in end settled plastic bought thinkbaby straw cup , used successfully eight months old the straw cup helped develop great water drinking habits , two years old drinks little libbey ikea juice glasses every day apparently transitional cup n't necessary two stars concept , silicone grip 
-1	cups terrible they heavy extremely bulky very difficult toddler handle do n't like ! 
-1	this waste money it makes awful buzzing sound like motor broken slow soft i would not buy ever would returned husband not tossed package ! 
-1	while portable mobile good idea theory , unit i received virtually useless connector arm loose per instructions , i snapped 2 parts connector arm together , attached mobile unit top using velcro strap however , top part connector arm ( part holds mobile hangs crib , bassinet , etc ) loose wobbly , matter much i tried adjust as result , mobile swung back forth basically unusable bassinet pack-and-play what 's , clamp 's supposed afix connector arm railing crib , bassinet , pack-and-play , etc , would n't hold mobile upright , kept falling bassinet matter much i tightened not inconvenient , also downright dangerous ! the swinging connector arm made problem worse rendering entire unit unstable ; mobile kept swinging around , clamp would give way , whole unit would fall bassinet needless say , item returned 
-1	first time mom protective baby liked colors animals ( bought animal friends one ) however , thing heavy & i could n't stand thought moment i walk away could fall & hit poor daughter right face ! sure tightened , i n't think enough safe ! if make lighter i would whole heartedly recommend 
-1	had return bad you could barely hear music motor makes mobile move good idea , poor execution 
-1	it looks cute n't work consistently sometimes n't want spin around thought sending back n't gotten around it n't cost much i guess get pay 
-1	another reviewer mentioned well -- mobile top-heavy using arm attach anything ! i 've attached arms reach co-sleeper bassinet ( making sure i put section 's bar & not something soft ) screwed tight would go within minute arm slowly starts lean forward due heaviness mobile you probably use 're not using arm ( ie using velcro strap attach infant carrier ) if 're not paying close attention , mobile fall baby 're using arm i 'm really surprised number 5-star ratings item received i returned item 
-1	this product underwhelms baby parents it needs louder different styles music pass one 
-1	i n't recommend mobile i wanted love we wanted mobile could clip stroller since daughter loves mobile crib but product not well made cons : - the music way soft we barely hear music ! which sad music seems really nice - the mobile moves slowly my daughter ca n't get interested wo n't catch eye attention - looks cheap i not expecting amazing , animals small cheap , wonder daughter not really like them disappointing keep looking 
-1	do not , i repeat do not buy highchair ! the cover not come , i 'm left hand scrubbing chair every single night ! ! ! if i could throw washer , 'd lot better also , seat permanent semi reclined position for sit little body tray , 's really far back chair , okay i guess i graco contempo daughter 3 years older son ( bought chair ) i really liked cover removable , came w 2 covers ( ! ! ! ) , and tray could closer smaller children farther children get older go highchair removable cover easily wipeable ( wood , plastic , ect ) cover 
-1	cheap poor quality i received bibs stitching already coming ( without even using/washing ) the backs also made cheap plastic , not like the sayings cute not buy bibs 
-1	these cups impossible put together take apart w/the handles there little ledges hold handles place lid i take knife pry take apart these also not leak proof milk ran daughters shirt stupid pc crap cups ! do not waste your money on this garbage ! 
-1	not compatable convertible cribs , anchor clamps narrow , unable attach frame bed the customer service company not good they send pictures anchor clamps child 's bed , not reply months when , already figured way get somewhat work , stated not guarenteed fit convertable beds , although box say we make adjustments get work i not sure would ever work described it angle , kid saw fun barrier jump somewhat flimsy not good deal 
-1	worked good short time son fell times ! ! ! i attached everything right way still not work , bought new bed ! ! not strong toddlers 
-1	this thing huge i bought hang side crib , 's ridiculously giant i ended nailing wall closet the & # 34 ; shelves & # 34 ; flimsy would never stand weight products shown photo i 'm going use ti store extra diapers lightweight cloth stuff really , i wish i n't bought 
-1	cloth no support it hangs gravity takes slopes forward nothing like picture this product needs solid plastic backing hold form sleeve parts its cardboard slips nothing hold shape velcro strips dont stick even super glue 
-1	i really excited get , although reviews mixed - i recently bought prince lionheart plastic one returned scratched changing table wood ( plastic sharp ) , i thought one soft would better well , velcro sharp side wraps around changing table wood also scratched wood it not look nice hanging changing table - place put wipes holder much bigger oxo wipes case looked funny , looked overall bulky hanging side i 'll returning item also probably figuring organizing one drawers diaper changing instead ! i 'm disappointed i hoping nice organizer handy this one not work 
-1	it great concept design still needs help we hanging wall save space , pockets ca n't take much weight without leaning angle bowing inwards ( especially side pockets ) they need something rigidize shelving back soft goods area 
-1	i really wanted work price everything seems fall it clips anything fine hard stuff stay shelves not worth 
-1	we n't even use it great compartments , way needs hang cribs : be sure you have side rails or front rails that are not too thin or curved as this design requires to hang straight up and down and will slide if not level ! ! hanging wall not option , wants wall ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! be cautious design , works great crib accomodate , even still , bulky not meant front crib 
-1	i wish i bought newer version bottles i like lines numbers printed color , 's much easier read see exactly much i 've pumped the newer caps also better screw smoother 
-1	ordered 5oz bottles pictured , received 8oz bottles n't need 8 oz reason needing 5oz beyond annoying 
-1	this pillow not worth money ! it 's not well padded i expected it 's comfortable using two regular pillows i got i 'm pregnant i really n't find comforting with last pregnancy , i one straight body pillows worked fine i n't wasted money one 
-1	this pillow ok already side sleeper , i found i would wake back everytime it also went flat quickly ! i think could use twice stuffing if normally back sleeper use 3 regular pillows ( head , back front ) it work way better spend even get u shaped pillow ca n't roll back middle night 
-1	first , i 'm huge fan beco carriers love beco butterfly however , i 'm pretty disappointed pads they feel cheap , 're not soft , really thin if i paid 10 bucks i might liked , i paid , seriously overpriced quality if i energy search better option i would return , since i n't , i 'll live overall , i n't recommend 
-1	first , i love tilty cups 8 month old however , lids n't work well i 'm not sure intended go original sippy lid replace , either way n't make sense if replace lid , find place sippy lid go travel , pain plus awkward sippy top sticking still if goes sippy lid , n't seal pops time either way , little tab perfect getting caught things pulling this sort works keep sippy spout clean , serves purpose far containing liquid want put sippy diaper bag i really hope would redesign lid ! 
-1	i bought cover thinking `` great deal '' i got so disappointed it small , 're baby moves wiggles even little bit end flashing everyone anyway not , 's struggle get , adjust baby , stay covered i found 's easier use receiving blanket hassle darn cover the stiff collar let see 're baby 're nursing struggle ! it flops falls whole thing mess knowing i know , i would 've picked cover i knew sure larger collar better design 
-1	it n't look cute i see picture my daughter n't really the design expectation 
-1	baby n't like , n't like sounds n't good forest mobile one idk worth invest another one 'm thinking not but easy assemble , works , long battery life ( given barely use ; ) ) wish octopus would look instead side , since baby staring well bottom legs missing legs n't think 's great think much mobile n't make sense , ha-ha 
-1	the product ok it fairly easy assemble the finish seems mark easily the item received slightly damaged a piece trim , normally stapled , come we able nail glue part back place without obvious repair since damage minor not discover product nearly assembled not bother return it i purchased product i bought matching crib the finish nearly identical crib set looks good nursery update- months starting using dresser handles started pull glued the drawers not slide well pulled slightly crooked also beware dragging dresser along light colored carpet mark carpet its still functional dresser i would n't buy unless good sale otherwise spend money something higher quality 
-1	this is not for large nipple women seeking increased milk stimulation i purchased b/c i need increase milk production description not complete it not explain not soft small nipples 
-1	i really hoping would make horns fit better , kill supply after using couple times ( hoping user error ) i gave thankfully , i also got hard plastic reducing flanges they work great i 've not issues since 
-1	i bought use pump style i found hard shields bit painful first i previously using thephilips avent bpa free manual breast pump , whitethat soft areola stimulator i found comfortable , i thought might help make pump style comfortable eh it slightly comfortable flexishields , i felt like suction really decreased plus , fit hard shields really weird way always falling not worth hassle so i used week shelved i eventually got used hard shields n't find uncomfortable anymore 
-1	this gocrib fabulously durably i love packaged nicely gocrib backpack it also comes sheet pad really cons product ease set i anticipated much easier set the pump fills relatively quickly laying everything , pumping blowing mattress little labor intensive setting pack n ' play the pack n ' play n't nearly portable lightweight 's trade make i suppose update : after handful uses pump completely broken very disappointed durability 
-1	not soft muslin blanket i i 've washed probably 6-8 times hopes would relax bit , unfortunately screen-printed crunch i 'll stick aden & anais sure ! 
-1	too big bulky little ones , n't get totally clean wash the leg holes gathered collected poop folds even prewash etc 
-1	the squares velcro sewn inside diaper 's back pointy sharp plastic edges almost immediately curl poke baby 's lower back i 've found outcome velcro diapers it shame ca n't redesign part diaper cause otherwise solid product i find snaps infinitely preferable velcro fuzzi bunz knickernappies given us best performance your mileage may vary ! the performance cloth diapers varies not inherent quality also well particular diaper fits kid 's body shape we leaks , terrible leaks , knickernappies one day , n't leak anymore conclusion : child grew size shape perfect diaper 
-1	i 've loads loads leaks diapers surprisingly i high hopes since popular 
-1	i bought hopes finding gate would easy use well made this gate neither the gate sturdy metal good , however sides gates little pins cushions - ones hold wall poorly made the cushions pins slip every chance get - end get sharp pins going wall - resulting scratches wall apart , locking mechanism not easy use if put gate somewhere need walk point - meaning need take gate put back , issue lock in order lock gate position want , need put little plastic part top lock correct spot , reason , get plastic part spot nightmare it wo n't go go , turning part works tandem plastic part makes pressure gate times far , meaning readjust plastic part i not one problems locking mechanism , husband , mother , mother , father sister problems i would look elsewhere need easy use gate unlock lock many times day if looking gate put n't unlock long periods time , n't bad gate since would n't deal problems daily 
-1	after two weeks using , returned it 's heavy bulky us if going moving day , n't get may heavy i got bamboo plastic one thats half weight seems sturdy far 
-1	ultimate question does job ? yes suppose job however , believe others would better ! i bought go stairs ( going ) one safe large space twins go crazy without loosing mind my stairway pretty wide use extensions ( course know buying ) once installed correctly ( mom able without waiting husband ) it rattles babies grab and doesnt seem secure it seem fine two 10 month old babies age im not sure get older my biggest complaint walk through ! what the heck were they thinking ! ! im skinny ( ok not rail thin ) im 5'7 132 pound woman normal hips width i hate walking its way small ! my seven year old walks fine husband walk sideways get carrying two 23 pound babies walk makes interesting maneuvering get i would not buy thing too bad concept great 
-1	bought extra wide hallway the use extensions came make gate unstable bent trying tighten suction cups wall we tested 10 month old would leaned , question , would fallen this dangerous we found baseboards product not the bottom gate touch floor we tried install baseboard since baseboards grooved , leaving 2 inch gap bottom we screwed suction cups like video instructions stated not floor gate unstable even though found installed improperly , still concerning able bend metal extensions screwing suction cups this kinda leads us believe metal somewhat flimsy if strong toddler may hang gate , probably would n't good idea get one screws wall ! ! 
-1	i wanted block wider area leads kitchen i bought extra wide span gate i shorter regalo gate really liked this basically gate includes extensions the problem extensions n't work well they linked metal rods weak my toddler truck gate like incredible hulk 'll separate links regalo make larger one-piece gate needing wider solution 
-1	i excited purchase 's not stable id like i 'm still afraid daughter , continued force , knock bows look top 's kinda secure , 's really not something would recommend due width smaller gate i ( different make ) stable 
-1	there way i would ever put safety child safety gate with extensions , way possible get tight enough the tighter go , bows wobbles this returned immediately ! ! i two safety first tension mounted gates i happy lesson learned do n't ever sacrifice price child 's safety ! ! 
-1	i lot research baby gates settling one i wanted top stair gate i would not drill wood banisters we 've box open hours i several issues 1 ) poor quality - my husband installed tonight velcro broke trying tighten around banister does not make feel good safety product 2 ) annoying close - when i purchased i not realize door mechanism works you basically lift door lower pegs holes i hoping something little less labor intensive closing because banisters not perfectly vertical ( round parts square parts ) end pull top part back ( i assumed 'd locking width set not deal sliding back forth open ) this spacing issue illustrated slightly example photo - see gate latched vertical bar middle overlaps bottom slightly larger gap top ours even pronounced difference 3 ) does n't fit setup - the leg bottom pretty much useless us we two wooden banisters mounted top small wooden base if try lengthen foot using adjustments , comes unscrewed contacts floor 4 ) door opens ways - i thought doors top stairs not swing stairs this gate swings ways ! update : after several months using gate still drives us nuts people come home hard time closing proper since put bottom part pull top part i 've seen people close top pegs ( bottom parts not ) also seen people close without top part fully latched this really worries toddlers love shake gates we 've tried avail make off-limits activity i think 's bit like putting candy front child telling not eat that said n't disasters our regular babysitter told several occasions gate drives crazy too i called company broken velcro good sending replacement pieces charge 
-1	i looking non-bannister-drill stairtop gate wanted get kidco opted one instead , i regretted every since ! pinched fingers , pulled screws plenty curses later i tons holes wall inoperative gate i first thought i installed stud ( studfinder told ) screws pulled time a holes , anchors , find anchoring n't work well spacers molding i realize driven physical location installation operation gate frustrating enough after years using kidco pressure gate previous residence ( one story apartment ) i better appreciate easy , one hand , non-finger injuring operation kidco gate so frustrating ! 
-1	even gate lined properly , difficult open close one hand if lift handle , not lift easily i end sticking foot lift middle if i purchase another gate , i would get something i could swing closed like door without line holes that said , gate , fine it attaches wall screws , 's secure i used longer screws , provided ones not long enough hit studs 
-1	i would pass gate there vastly better gates many cost less this one example i would highly recomendhttp : //www amazon com/gp/product/b006umub92/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc ; =1i bought gate top stairs specs reviews seemed indicate would work well initially i impressed attached stairs i state prospros- the way attaches stairs actually among best i seen gate most friends jury rig gates 2x4 & # 8217 ; get work steps this gate attaches banisters easily snugly cons & # 8211 ; there lot- i unable open gate one hand i 6 & # 8217 ; 4 & # 8221 ; not i weak you unlatch gate lift , not put enough force gate latch you lift closer hinge - the instructions hard read not clear- the screws comes not nearly long enough , plan needing own - the way gate latches not work well you lift gate inch , carefully position hole , lower hole this seems easy , not it top bottom hole latch difficult get latch time other gates also able catch gate near latch making latching easily this gate not that - this one annoying the gate extends fit various size openings , way lock specific length so basically every time open gate end changing gate length resize again in end i duct tape gate keep one length , i broke part latch i could latch one hand , i broke bottom latch the gate still strong daughter not able open , it work this also 5th 6th gate install i know i doing i give two stars banister attachments quite good , everything else bad 
-1	first , n't come wall anchors come my 9 month old son pulled one side straight wall second , 's pain $ $ close one hand third , even closed red locking piece my son can open it ! this wo n't last 2-3 like listing says , i 'll lucky lasts 1 ! ! not pieces n't using ca n't used anything else they 're taking space closet somewhere , could used another space house honestly , biggest waste money ever the thing stops dog , even not long it would cheaper effective build baby gate 
-1	when first got instructions little confusing screws came way short went got longer ones it worked okay , fell apart easily months completely came apart the plastic connecting pieces completely came metal gate pieces so became totally unusable months i loved concept way worked n't falling apart , still not built well enough 
-1	this looks like cuddly lovey pic , say 's blankie , 's really closer dog toy the entire thing made noisy crinkly cellophane , snuggling startles baby it 's much smaller something like , center big squeaky button like dog toy the feet chewing made hard pvc like plastic rather softer silicon plastics usually see things have seen better versions idea 
-1	my little one must facing outward -- world exciting i somehow missed research ergo could n't outward-facing carrier , i bummed i thought i 'd give shot anyway , really wo n't work -- i attempted peanut started crying if i baby n't mind facing , 'd great 's well made , great back support ( 're coming baby bjorn , hell back ) , really high quality alas , 's not i return , 're trying cybex 2 go carrier next we 'll find one eventually work well ! ! : ) 
-1	we bought hoping carry 7 month old son everyone raved ergo carriers , decided give try upon receiving , i noted instruction manual recommends use front carrier 6 months old turns 's really good reason our 19 pound baby way heavy front carry carrier we uncomfortable so , i tried adjusting hip carry it 's horrible hip carrier the straps n't straight , 're angled they dug neck , put weight there i n't interested carrying baby young back , i return it as side note - i picked performance carrier i wanted carry summer , 's quite hot well , i opened , i realized n't going happen the material really thick , lining black there 's also lining baby , i knew 'd sweating ( like another carrier 'd tried ) 
-1	worst purchase yet amazon 9 mo old cosco walker grandparents flies place purchased home hates he knows get around walker , one frustrates end the back wheels not move ! how call walker wheels stiff move ? i tried remove rubber coating hoping would remedy no luck , wheels stiff turn now i stuck piece junk alot people reviewing , babies small use walker that review count looks favorable they wait child gets big enough use intended purpose this joke call walker truthful rating would 0 stars 
-1	the seat piece fabric cushion the adjustments minimal seams like barely moved the walker tall 3-4 month old i tall baby we returned item went babies r us bought cheapest babies r us brand way better one cost less 
-1	i n't happy product ending sending back the toys seemed cheap cost & # 34 ; set & # 34 ; actually not terribly competitive buying similar toys individually 
-1	i bought travel system daughter thinking i would save money getting stroller car seat combo , i wrong cons:1 there good head support newbies protection overall it comes headpiece moves place movement straps unlike car seats come head protection onthe sides , car seat not feature , although says does 2 it sooo bulky before bought minivan , honda civic would barely fit in fact , part cloth tore often 3 my daughter 8 months weighs 23 lbs outgrown car seat , although says hold 30 lbs the bottom fastener pinch thighs i use length straps so , i search convertible seat hence , travel system not save money 4 the front wheel , first , would jiggle little went fast eventually , became bad even normal striding pace , i stop wheel would shake 5 the lining stroller 's seat hard 's uncomfortable especially daughter trying fall asleep pros:1 the car seat well padded 2 variety colors3 lots storage space4 cup holders 
-1	if i n't lazy n't destroyed packing opening toys , i would returned i got one-year old loves push buttons the one toys & # 34 ; work & # 34 ; remote the two toys flat push buttons not - even three-year old difficulty very disappointed 
-1	i really looking forward using product transition 13 week old baby crib , received product , packaging old mobi yellow discoloration , packaging fell apart even touched i figured i would try anyway , put batteries didnt work so figured maybe batteries old , i tried brand new energizer batteries still didnt work i return product im think next time ill go rechargable mobi 
-1	i bought second sound machine 1 year old parents house piece garbage it 5-6 white noise sounds strange jarring there one sounds like rain one not horrible sounding it also not loud there button blue light super bright annoying ca n't turn i sending back i bought mybaby homedics soundspa - sleepy snail house i love 
-1	the idea product great this model opinion not good sound choices i would research get something relaxing sounds baby since hear i sleep sheep love wanted soemthing didnt turn 45min this bust 
-1	when i registered , i told essential item to blunt , 's not once transitioned son crib , increasingly mobile ( approx 3 months ) , whole idea using sheet saver kind went window in terms quality , looks pretty for us , using sheet saver ended not making sense logistically 
-1	these affordable , compared 100 % cotton bamboo ones i , i thought i would try they terrible water rolls , n't clean well they also seem rough compared natural fiber ones they n't much dry , wet , water beads makes mess do n't bother 
-1	they 're not soft also , pilled wash i n't like idea trying wipe baby 's bum pilly cloths now i use wash cloths bathroom 
-1	these wipes ultra soft perfect baby 's skin they absorb well , stay moist wipe warmer , plus cloth wipes however , i longer use wipes make laundry - simple task - complete hassle ! they seamed 3 times along outer edges , every wash seems come apart , leaving strings hanging loose dryer the first washes n't problem , i cut loose thread dried but every wash , threads become wrapped around inserts diaper liners point i end huge tangled mess i cut apart i put anything dryer if one wipe i would think mistake , seams every single wipe unthreaded washer caused nightmare it 's pretty ridiculous pay much wipes cheaply manufactured fall apart washes 
-1	i ordered thinking would replacement change pad ju ju be diaper bag , same/similar quality ones actually come bag instead basically piece fabric , way thin fabric i wanted another change pad i could wash one always one bag however , one not good enough there padding , thin fabric it also little smaller i expecting basically save money , skip purchase

-1	this would great product actually worked - features fantastic - great look - compact - long battery life - sensitivity setting etc but simple wont work - range terrible - cant even go 30ft apt - also says range apparent reason goes range beeps loudly wanted love - i hate product - not waste money 
-1	the audio unit n't work even used properly it would n't activate i next room even room baby wailing ! it scared i could hear baby crying ( finally ) monitor n't even register it happened many times i finally decided i must defective unit i 'm returning , i 'm looking another video monitor btw i happy video portion monitor it made baby look like bright eyes night vision actually helped know awake

-1	i purchased monitor summer infant slim & secure i using daily 3 years stopped working it terrible the reception insanely bad my daughter 's room 20 meters away mine i get signal beep least three times night also , absolutely not work bathroom , additional 5 meters away an additional con infrared & # 34 ; & # 34 ; lights bright i fan avent products purchased monitor due confidence brand i incredibly dissapointed i already purchased another summer infant monitor replace one 
-1	i purchased monitor reading reviews consumer reports figured would great fit loft home for first two half months n't really need child never slept sight/earshot , started going sleep staying asleep figured would put one floor away us we could not hear thing monitor started screaming ( never done usually grunts makes whimpering noises getting upset ) we heard grunting moving around ( things hear room ) the way heard near stairs the worst part noise going - breastpump ! now first i thought i crazy first time not room sleeping , but i tried ( time really attentive monitor stairs ) still volume terrible this is not worth it ! i hoping return since i used twice times not monitor 
-1	neither twins , 9 & 11lbs fit - small pity will stick bjorns 
-1	just received item today i purchased front-facing-out option , returning i generous rate 2 stars support baby 's legs much better popular carriers allow baby 's legs dangle however , still not even come close supporting daughter 's legs knee-to-knee , really recommended carrier , turned 6 mos today , 28 '' long , weighs 17 lbs- not abnormally large baby as others mentioned , fabric supports leg rigid tight struggle put finger leg carrier- , not chubby baby- left indentations thighs 10 min wear i ca n't imagine would hour ! also , 99th percentile length front facing position , face shoved front carrier , even folded , if smaller baby position , would face-first fabric , defeats purpose , not mention would uncomfortable possibly suffocation risk because fabric crossing cheeks , constantly looking get away , would get uncomfortable pretty quickly the dangling straps also fairly annoying i really hoping love carrier seemed like best option , sadly , returned 
-1	after literally 6 months research , looking forward receiving product i ordered metro black , receive luca black - 2 designs could not different so annoying i return amazon purchase new carrier not exactly want spending time last week pregnancy $ 130 product ! ! hopefully 'll get right 2nd time around 
-1	was big 5 month old 15lbs not able spread legs accomodate width carrier also clips way time consuming/difficult open/close quickly even oneself needs assistance returned : ( wanted like one badly 
-1	i followed instructions making written names & # 34 ; permanent & # 34 ; n't stay i n't even wash first time ! i still use bands cups , rewrite names periodically disappointed ! 
-1	these bibs strong chemical odor i not feel comfortable putting baby babies put everything mouths strong chemical odor , i imagine made 
-1	these bibs seemed like great idea , care instructions say not machine wash , wipe that n't get pocket clean strip fabric along edge and something interupts ca n't wipe bib soon meals 're super hard get clean baby food dried a regular cloth bib works much better 
-1	i bought bibs retailer i thought would work well , terrible first , plastic stiff not drape baby , means slides around time food gets around second , others said quite hard clean , especially around piping third , pocket pretty much flush bib therefore n't catch much fourth , bib relatively short , would n't problem pocket worked better fifth , although waterproof plastic may seem like good idea , fact liquids rolled straight bib onto baby 's lap for someone looking bib i would recommend soft cloth bib waterproof plasticized backing large size bib sleeves 
-1	let start saying every bottle i read reviews amazon complaints leaking i torn choosing classic glass bottles , playtex vent-air drop-ins , avent , mam i 've proven likely related `` operator error '' awake leak happens that said , i 'm not happy bottles i wanted i found avent bottles work better circumstance before baby 's arrival , lots reading reviews amazon , i sold mam nipple shape , especially i planning long term breastfeeding would send baby daycare i liked could take apart better easy cleaning , turns 's not easy the 'self-sanitizing ' feature another good idea part , n't work though , inside microwave short 9oz bottles another selling factor got cuteness shame me i regret buying mam bottles i learned easy avent bottles the mam bottles work intended , unnecessarily troublesome when came time send baby day care return work , i discovered frustrating mam bottles first , make sure bottom screwed **really** tight , otherwise water used heat mix contents bottle this turns pain - literally - comes time take bottle apart washing this extra thick , screw-on bottom makes warming contents extra long compared bottles , avent once finally get milk warmed take mam bottle hot water , careful not burn baby steaming water collected screw-on bottom vent holes banging n't get makes much noise night time feedings anytime matter using wash burp cloth protect baby yet another added hassle one thing maneuver trying feed baby none issues exist avent bottles an extra ring nothing compared base parts mam bottles popping lid avent bottles also another easy thing compared mam when 're juggling crying baby bottle , 's not convenient use counter-top edge pop bottle 's lid , 's something i 've resort , unfortunately avent 's lids secure enough prevent leaking without requiring 2-hand operation as added bonus , avent conversion kit allows pump using ameda purely yours electric breast pump directly avent bottle 
-1	i find much like cloth diapers effective potty learning as far i tell , 22 month old thinks cloth diapers pees freely she seem try hold underwear unfortunately , not enough like diapers , not fully waterproof one pee i usually changing , pants possibly wiping floor so 're good , either the one step ahead daytime trainers better waterproof trainers , though unless 're going sending daycare , i think waterproof trainers slowing potty learning on hand , 're better pull-ups 
-1	i hoped cost one package pull-ups i could greener solution night wetting , first night daughter wore leaked the fit good , must problem w/absorbency money drain & sheets wash 
-1	i using diapers almost year hated every minute ! the inserts not fit , bunch causes leak my daughters not heavy weters leak legs half hour i contacted fuzzibunz , adjusted leg elastic , used approved detergent , lines dryed , chemical rash cream , still junk i bought couple bumgenius horrible experience ready give awesome ! my kids go least three hours one diaper , leaks ! ! please not spend money i go waste p s snaps broke 24 50 total i bought junk diapers

-1	the description needs include fact item works outlets use one screw middle , two slots plugs most outlets house not allow screw middle -- use 2 screws , one top one bottom instead 
-1	i use 3 knives get dang thing open first time i n't one tried either - three adults could n't get dang thing apart of three plug covers i bought , one definitely keep baby , really frustrating getting apart first time i put knife two tabs pry open sides 
-1	i seriously hate i wonder i got dud - not single person ( 3 adults tried ) could get open even install outlet do favor get newer kind little pinch clips ! 
-1	this supposed & # 34 ; teach baby hold bottle & # 34 ; that 's good theory , straps not long enough even reach little guy 's mouth ! my son could hold bottle time big enough strap long enough bottle reach 
-1	it 's super cute now i n't worry temperature hot cold sometimes i n't realize water getting cold becuz i 'm occupied playing daughter , , i red really catches eye reminds bath time she loves turtle it 's soft cute doubles bath toy update- week 's usage i say i 'm really disappointed product the temperature gauge stopped working i returning : ( guess i listened reviews

-1	i really , truly not understand 5 star reviews this bag piece junk as another reviewer stated , looks much nicer pictures when i finally saw person , looked cheap the worst part zippers low quality not tough actually zip , main zipper already broke i 'd using bag 2 months ! the plus large storage space inside if thought diaper bag bargain good true , correct spend little get skip hop brand i using hand-me-down skip hop bag since one broke , quality much better especially zippers do n't waste money bag ! ! ! 
-1	i n't return lot items amazon , one i we first ordered bag black/avocado , two months saying would shipped , got word color longer available so ordered black/tuquoise , thinking would work the color ok , bag n't work us first , big when i opened delivery box , i could n't believe big i 'm spacious bags , one n't even spacious ; big flat , leads second complaint bag it n't seem practical i could n't imagine easy access things i would need long deep , skinny in end , bag not work we ended returning bag getting eddy bauer bag ten bucks great us 
-1	i 've cup month i think looks cute easy baby hold the flow seems right not leak however , valve smells strongly awful chemicals , point i felt like i giving poison child i washed valve smell always is bpa free ? i 'm looking something else i believe cup could detrimental child 's health long run 
-1	i used trainers older children decided go # 3 amazon great price i ordered three very disappointed morning open box see not cups featured the ones i received clear spout like bottles in picture , white spout like old trainer cups my little guy chew thru quickly teeth arrive surprised error , item came directly amazon 
-1	the `` variable nipple '' really nipple big hole pours like stream ! leaks everywhere unusable with sippy cup fluid comes fast daughter ( 9mo ) chokes though maybe would get better experience ? the good thing bottle/cup comes handle you use handle avent bottles well collar , seal , lid so i guess n't total loss but definitely leaks ! 
-1	my little one n't like using sippy cup spout ended using bottle twice b/c ebf oh well , least great price you might find success little one bottle often and/or likes harder spout 
-1	there ton parts first and , i n't see benefit products far cheaper plus , 's 4 ounces n't seem like enough i n't super impressed - especially not price 
-1	i really tried bottles daughter n't like they n't good flow gas issues for first trainer cups , i use pampers bottles really took well 
-1	these 2 pieces minky fabric sewn together no padding the velcro sides stretched longer rest cover this causes edge velcro stick scratchy 
-1	i purchased daughter 's car seat straps would not rub bare neck unfortunately others stated , velcro scratches neck causes harm straps this product cheaply made i immediately returned 
-1	i wish i bought jjcole 's instead these thin velcro strap always turns inward towards sons face 
-1	this product seemed like a good idea but it was really not i did not like how the baby was pressed against my sister 's chest it seemed like there was not enough space for the 28 pound she is an average size baby so fatness was not an issue and the product is recommended for 8-35 pounds it has too many straps and the material seems very basic ( cheap ) we discarded this product because the baby was not very comfortable in it 
-1	as product reviewer & active parent , tried 25 different brands carriers we lots say carriers - first , two general comments : ( 1 ) you *definitely* need carrier want baby excel development ( motor skills , emotional maturity , immunity/health , etc ) studies show children body-contact parents excel every area ( this especially important fathers - make sure find comfortable carrier fits well , *enjoy* bonding time ! ) ( 2 ) if active person ( committed lot contact baby ) , single carrier meet needs i personally 3 carriers - one around house , one super-portable light errands , boba hiking , camping , long outings that said , infantino lands bottom half list it copy-cat boba , cheaper every way : * cheap fasteners & hardware* fabric frays , loose stitching* low quality parts* not enough fabric counts* straps bit short truly comfortablekeep mind , 've never tried another carrier , may not notice things but i *comparing* 25 carriers , find infantino products almost always inferior for heavy-duty carrier , important feature *hip belt* ( like high quality camping backpack ) distributes weight hips most carriers put weight back neck - gets old really fast this infantino knock-off boba , quality hip belt the problem , infantino belt short ( skimped fabric counts ) , n't rest hips correctly unless 24 '' waist i realize boba twice price in opinion 's worth ( really put price tag back pain ? ) anyway , others consider : the maya sling one favorites they versatile ( baby lays , sits upright , sits side , etc ) amazon sells ( maya wrap lightly padded ring sling-new 2010 colors ( medium , pool ) ) find $ 30 , make - 's fun ! just buy set maya rings , pick favorite fabric even novice make one themselves the moby similar maya , moby wrap baby carrier , many advantages , little bulkier it 's difficult wear baby side moby i still give moby high ratings , like maya better the side-carriers nice ( baby side , almost arm ) much comfortable sounds you nurse standing , great dad , comfortable baby i keep side carrier use around house ( cooking , washing dishes , even light yard work ) but weight neck/back , 's not versatile `` outings '' i use around house , takes 2 seconds slip on/off , i end using 2 hours day scootababy baby carrierbaby bjorn definitely top 5 choice this use light outings ( farmer 's market , mall , etc ) it 's padded comfortable , light weight , somewhat versatile ( baby faces ) , one easiest loading carriers much lighter/thinner/sleeker boba good mom dad babybj & ouml ; rn baby carrier originalplease n't confuse boba `` balboa '' if 're dr sears fan ( i not ) 've seen endorsements balboa ( available target stores ) however , similar design got recalled january 2010 ( suffocation issues ) they made adjustments 's probably safer , bottom line any sling-style carrier `` cinches '' sides ( elastic , etc ) keeps baby hidden risks smothering i 'm sure 99 % people never problem , i n't like and i n't find comfortable anyway : balboa baby adjustable sling dr searsfinally , ergoergo baby carrieris well constructed , comfortable , distributes weight intelligently ( hips ) i also give high ratings - i also find bit bulkier , since need two carriers design , i prefer boba i hope information helps have fun traveling around baby , & introducing him/her world !

-1	i 4 different styles baby carriers baby bjorn sport , infantino standard , evenflo , infantino ecosash except product , i actually double carriers carry twin infants once because product , infantino ecosash featured back carrying , i hoping able carry one infants back one front however , n't quite possible w/ way 's positioned for twin usage , n't work either front back with positioning front , carrier infant center chest from back , straps way on individual basis , baby bjorn active sport remains best baby carriers i 've used 's great back support ease use this product extremely cumbersome install infant whether back front my babies roughly 14 lbs , arms kept shifting inward getting stuck at home , sit handle baby front back but using product go , would extremely difficult get baby w/o another person helping not mention sash straps would drag ground while front carry position ok load , n't back support like baby bjorn in addition , carrying back , straps kept slipping shoulders to prevent straps slpping shoulders , i criss cross sash straps like would carry front it prevented straps falling , far comortable straps positioned i actually n't recommend using product back , seemed little unsafe infants whether using back front option , extra sash tie quite long tie several times prevent dangling strangely you overall , i ca n't quite recommend product 
-1	i find carrier beautiful , i actually n't mind long straps carrier fits wide variety body types i , example , 5 feet tall 115 pounds my husband 5 foot 10 170 pounds we liked idea able switch baby back forth us without readjusting different clips found carriers i excited try carrier , i first used em month old she curled , ball , i n't bother making put legs legholes , obviously way wide her fast forward today-my daughter 4 months old , screams every time i try put carrier the leg holes way far apart , i ca n't figure make comfortable she basically splits order ride carrier ! i wish i returned gotten something else if anyone suggestions alternate configurations leg holes , would greatly appreciated otherwise , cut losses buy new carrier use i strongly disagree 8-35 lb weight guideline , obviously mistake unless , course , i missing something ?

-1	my son 4 months old 15 lbs this bulky diaper looks akward i love print , said i not like diaper boils the mesh inside pointless snap diaper you use needs washed since mesh pee i change son every feeding last night slept three hours , i wake literally drenched pee his onsie , bedding soaked 's 4 months so upset cause not i wake sleep , i also clean bedding i could nurse put back sleep i tried nap time make sure n't user error late night pee everywhere i laying next happened the super absorbancy pads suck opinion 
-1	my baby 's skin reacts fabric hook loop part diaper i bunch diapers i need sell give away i prepped first : -/soooo n't prep 1 know baby reacts ! 
-1	these nice size , unfortunately fabric not soft i 'm going look something else use baby 
-1	material rough cheap after seeing i n't even use baby 's skin coz felt harsh rough touching i worried would cause rash i n't expecting lot considering price softer cloth huge disappointment i kept cleaning toys 
-1	dont use wash clothes , bought use place kleenexes im feeding baby girl , almost like bib/rag wipe little spillage after/during feedings , work great purpose know super cheap affordable alternative tissues ( still waste ton ) arent soft good quality : ) 
-1	not big fan these wash clothes quantity quality i bought 3 packs crayola wash clothescrayola washcloth setcrayola crayola 7 pack beginnings washcloth setthat sooo much better the crayola kind think terry cloth like texture one side cloth border around edge these border like cut squares thin cloth these washclothes relegated second bathroom status `` go '' wipe up if need thin mobile washcloth - product want something last actually gentle soft baby 's face ( places ) crayola gig as bonus - crayola 's also embroidered name color - good learning tool ! 
-1	we one advocate child seats function designed , easy toddler pull cupholder , 's two little arms n't quite long enough grab cup easily also sticks pretty far , whoever sitting next carseat going cupholder lap 
-1	this cup holder placed far toward bottom carseat daughter could n't reach then broke month use ! 
-1	not fit properly 
-1	just got cup holder today came free new advocate 70cs purchased do n't advocate yet i thought i would try 6 month old boulevard 70cs previous reviewers indicated cutouts plastic fabric allow holder snap place i somewhat astonished britax , especially since box indicates holder good boulevard i hopeful new advocate cutouts otherwise cup holder worth i paid worthless before dropping one penny thing please check seat cutouts fabric cover plastic beneath outer edge i would guess childs knees might n't cutouts n't buy goofy mistep normally good company 
-1	we received cup hanger ordered amazon had return refunded money can not rate product never got install car seat its funny britax not include car seats standard brands ******update may 2013****so i cup holder i ordered another one not impressed i received firs sticks way much car seat easily damaged time passengers regularly seat next car seat shame britax not inbuilt cup holder spending close $ 300 quality car seat because 2nd car seat not britax updating 1 2 stars time i actually got complete product i think missing component issue britax issue not amazon issue i seen lot reviews complaining missing components various retailer websites 
-1	let start saying , i love britax car seats i suppose cup holder better nothing however , i think several design flaws we two britax marathon car seats side side back seat yukon the cup holder not fit forward facing car seat door , door would not close so put side next sisters rear facing car seat it literally wedged leans forward therefore half time , daughter not get drink b/c cup holder leaning far forward reach on rear facing seat works ok , still far reach opinion it convenience my husband wants know world car seat expensive not come sort cup holder built it seems like could little better theit cup holder design 
-1	constantly gets knocked 
-1	i got free i purchased britax boulevard 70 , not use i 'm usually driving would useless cupholder attached carseat back i use valco baby tri-mode ex stroller not stay well any time i drink , i keep hand i pushed stroller granted , not made use valco baby stroller , 's sense getting cupholder use carseat ? it 's not i 'm going push huge convertible carseat round ! i 've since gotten valco baby universal cupholder , works much better ! update september 2012 -- -- i n't usually reply negative comments remarks ( anyone , not ) i feel need time , especially since first time i 've gotten negative remarks to folks commented review-you 're right , cup holder meant car seat , not i still sleep-deprived mama moreover , i wrote review , daughter discharged hospital second open heart surgery subsequent re-admittance severe dehydration resulting medications 'd given i not paying attention name/intended purpose product as daughter never got bottle cup whilst sitting car seat ( always weak ) , never occurred that purpose cup holder therefore , let rephrase review : this cup holder not useful , sole user product however , works fine car seat , offers another cup holder passenger sitting next 
-1	this n't fit onto either models cup huge n't work drinks save money 
-1	got holder along car seat flimsy cup holder tilts outward away seat falls easily not impressed 
-1	i recently purchased four different cloth diapers see brand i liked best : charlie banana , alva , hero , bumgenius unfortunately , least favorite i really wanted love i think option disposable insert great the fit n't ideal 5 5 month old in order get fit snuggly around thighs , i use tightest setting ( chubby thighs ) , get fit waist snuggly i used mid snap setting this caused fabric not lay flat the snaps n't proportional 
-1	bought one try-must admit least favorite stash ( i might minority opinion ) it stay fairly dry two inserts washes ok- began pill quickly the inserts n't best- i use i not like pocket front- 's always wet kinda gross it 's difficult get insert pul material almost sticky it n't fit baby well the size waist tight thighs 
-1	i love idea eco-friendly products unfortunately , little mask smell soiled diapers i found pointless use smell whether 're one bags not they stick together 's hard pull one apart one-handed 
-1	typically i use sassy disposable diaper sacks ( blue , come box 200 ) price rose i decided try summer infant ones they half size blue sassy ones ( would fit 3-4 pee diapers i 'd toss ) hold one , maybe two , diapers they also thin finger went right one i tried slip finger two sides open bag i 'll go back sassy 's soon i use summer infant ones - n't take long considering use new one diaper change fit one diaper wipe ! 
-1	i understand people love ergo , 's big i could never get tight enough always felt like baby falling i 'm 5 ' 105lbs i could not get shoulder straps buckled without strain husband could n't get buckle 's yogi reverse prayer we returning today i got nice padded mai tai instead 's fully adjustable perfect build 
-1	i wish mine counterfeit that way i could return torture device unfortunately authentic i 'm stuck it i registered item baby registry received shower when time came try baby , late return it the product high quality item the problem n't fit ( average height weight ) body all baby 's weight either bladder low back , depending i adjust straps while things super fun reminders pregnant , 's not i 'm looking baby carrier i 'm holding hope baby bit bigger back-carry option good us also , side-carry feature joke ? the strap goes exactly across throat ! 
-1	we brought ergo options carrier everyone raved ergo 's much better baby 's backs we brought options version wanted one black we 've since baby born , 's 8 months old hate it pros:1 ) back support it support back really well 2 ) head cover we like cover goes head give shade sun create darkness help get sleep cons:1 ) it 's extremely awkward put you put waist band first , put baby fold front baby putting arms straps now tough part clip shoulder blades unless 're ultra flexible huge fight every time then use infant insert well , makes trickier 2 ) it 's ridiculously hot using warm day ( 75'f+ ) unbearable the baby gets hot sweaty , pushing , arching back crying get plus get unbearably hot 's not pleasant experience please note : small people ( i 'm 115lbs ) , size not factor here 3 ) the material digs baby 's skin our baby 8 months weighs 16lbs we live nyc weather heating , plus carrier creating much heat 've short sleeved onesie legs bare the material legs stick digs thighs creating red indent skin 4 ) baby ca n't face outwards since son lot alert hates not able see tries twist around time maybe 've using wrong everyone seems love , 're going try sell buy baby bjorn instead i trialed friend 's one 's million times better ! 
-1	november 25 , 2011 update : i dropped review original 5-star last january , today 's 2-star after 10 months use , things monitor horribly wrong first , battery included monitor quit us 4 months ago wo n't hold charge anymore the instruction manual said contact motorola replacement so i the battery is unavailable for purchase so motorola sells baby monitor rechargeable , replaceable battery longer carry actual battery i even googled battery i ca n't find even 3rd party selling it second , i commented originally parents ' monitor needed larger footprint this become annoyance even light , even us awake , monitor nearly impossible stand it invariably back onto front back it nearly impossible stand upright why still 2-stars instead one ? while remain plugged , monitor awesome monitor clear , snaps pops we get incredible range within home it still handy used daily january 2011 reviewi surprised find motorola making monitor you n't see stores but knowing motorola 's rep regards handheld radios , i figured motorola making monitor , must pretty good it we get good distance unit importantly get loud operation annoying blinky lights going master bedroom sleep good looking monitor my drawback minor , parents ' monitor needs larger footprint it tall unit size base 
-1	our 4 month old breaking halo sleep sack swaddle every night decided get something could n't break we heard binding legs tight cause hip problems , seemed ideal , however i disappointed going try return it these problems i : she falls asleep feeding 's difficult get without waking with halo swaddle , put arm flaps open feed , put sleeping closed flaps easily without waking with , fuss lot get closed also , 3-6 mo length much long 50th percentile 4 month old finally , legs free , 's much easier move around , kept lifting legs shifting weight side looked like close rolling belly never done , would dangerous would n't hands free push could move head side 
-1	i bought grey one paid money i i received lime green one 
-1	this item ridiculous i actually bought amazon prime feature i n't slept 8 months since son born mind n't functioning properly once i got , i realized i extra table spoon drawer n't need , n't worth money time return so , i still the photo shows green item grey ( again , something mind missed ) it good quality i ca n't believe i spent almost $ 8 piece plastic seriously n't waste money do n't let sleep deprivation think twice 
-1	i received today i rather disappointed different existing one home bought extra daycare differences obvious really make wonder could come manufacturer if something going products manufactured differently originals , amazon disclose information , yet mention description i truly puzzled - smaller vulli completely different weight alone , density flimsy definitely not one got originally nordstrom subsequently 6 month old daughter seems much less interested chewing kept throwing floor whereas absolutely loves one nordstrom i would caution considering buying amazon not let price make decision , end two useless tethers questionably made makes little concerned materials going daughter 's mouth i ca n't even return i washed right box gave daughter this priced well compared price stores , definitely money wasted us 
-1	this product really n't seem safe our 10 day old daughter not strong yet managed pull face within minutes we tried tucking neckline bit wa able squirm arms much fabric hardly seemed worth , able wake and get mad contained too bad , zipper seemed like nice , easy alternative bulky blankets 
-1	ordered britax foot muff 8 months old since winter coming this nicely fits britax b-agile stroller agood material ( looks great ) only , yet big , issue small my daughter fits right now fall when winter , doubt use it far shorter stroller even difficult zip wearing shoe just wondering britax make little longer roomy or put product size it surely not one size product 
-1	when i got cup holder not come right nuts bolts i call britax directly get resolved eventually several emails i finally called directly once sent new cup holder i found i never even used i slide rail attached weight drink i would not recommend cup holder 
-1	ended returning item my 5-mo old looked uncomfortable constricted she 's big age ( 19 lbs first tried ) center white piece easily pops , revealing parts could easily hurt fingers 
-1	i really n't like swaddleme neither daughter i ended giving away it worked better swaddle daughter receiving blanket 
-1	this tub seems like good idea last stages however , infant seat awful ! ! for starters , `` gripper feet '' n't grip anything thing slides place not good 're dealing slippery , floppy baby ! second , thing sits far , baby slides right bottom , little knobby thing meant keep sliding end pressing uncomfortably baby 's perineum both son daughter ( twins ) obviously uncomfortable seat third , infant seat narrow one rolling motion baby might go right edge finally , `` machine washable pad '' takes sour smell let air dry you wash every time bathe baby else live smell i wish i not spent much money tub i would much rather one sling ones i know baby not slide roll 
-1	we purchased item last year son baby # 2 started using , noticed two chargers wires exposed ( 's awesome considering could caused fire ) noticed second monitor wo n't even turn like i said item worked great us first i would n't recommend friend 
-1	if i could give product zero stars , i would although excellent features , monitor n't work it consistently would lose signal beep with new born baby , i n't need reasons not sleep not mention nights completely stopped working , way knowing wake baby crying not hearing monitor luckily small enough house i could hear anyway which another reason monitor never lost signal small house 
-1	the reason i n't rate 1 star not stopped working 6 months ( monitors purchased ) i like feature push button talk child i also like unlike analog models , n't interfere cell phone usage we use 2 year old full volume , hear crying yelling something we hear talking ca n't make saying it certainly not range specified we live average sized one story home neighborhood reach across house careful put even issues , sony baby call much better bet , especially newborns babies want hear breathing 
-1	the monitors advertise 2000 foot range we lot camping , i thought would great use child slept camp trailer however , even standing directly outside trailer door open signal drops i ca n't even use home outside bedroom window worst monitor ever ! 
-1	the monitor works great 's working , time lot trouble last night last straw : husband i asleep i woke suddenly realizing i n't heard baby cry way past feeding time i looked monitor make sure everything looked normal screen , reading temperature , said signal however i still got check baby case imagine surprise i walked bedroom realize baby screaming ! both units , yet n't picking noise nursery i immediately lost trust product ! in addition scare , several reasons i would not recommend product : battery not stay charged long ( not even night ) , screen not light hard see night , i wish flashing light top option do not purchase this product 
-1	i got gift back january third child born march , thankfully replacement warranty getting sent back i iffy since reviews husband really thought would great due features especially distance well , let tell worked awhile time went got worse worse the distance 're lucky reaches 2 feet battery life joke this monitor constantly loses reception turn shows sound , units plugged you buy monitor safely monitor child sleeping , not happen piece junk lucky truly stay away not take even free 
-1	one specific music clip irritates bouncing n't work well swinging baby a safer bet buy swinging set cuz babies like swinging motions better i got baby shower should put swinging set baby registry well people may choices eventually return items n't like 
-1	my husband i bought 2 jumperoos - one baby einstein one called luv u zoo fisher-price we % 95 baby 's toys made fisher price , thought would sure like we wrong the 2 good things jumperoo baby einstein lacking , 2 features:1 the fisher price jumperoo motion activated music , option leave music playing 20 minutes baby einstein works pressed piano 's keys ( plays cute classic music 10-15 seconds , select say colors shapes 3 different languages ) 2 fisher price rest area arms swivel seat , great younger babies although baby einstein 's jumperoo assembly took longer , base a lot ( ! ! ! ! ! ) sturdy n't giggle side side fisher price wobbly , truly felt like safety hazard put baby the wobbly part 2 arms sides , felt like could snap base this fisher price jumperoo disappointing , returned next day 
-1	i gotten two amazon neither work ! the lights sound not work , i double checked batteries installed correctly the first one i bought i already completely assembled i found n't work i exchanged one replacement amazon learned lesson ; i put batteries lights sound component assembling sure enough , n't work i getting obviously used jumpers amazon i 'm paying & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; price i tell used gross smudges parts little slimy fingers i 'm not sure problem manufacturer defect , fact amazon selling used items new prices also , i get first one fully assembled , wobbly seat not seem fit place correctly , spin easily 
-1	looks like toy we thought much bigger actually the rubber not softest ratteler inside could get annoying not bendy thought for price not worth least give dog cheaper buying dog toy 
-1	if i give stars i would i given two swings mom gift for twins sleep nothing swings i would let sleep nite durring day could nap i would not turn didnt last long one mine went motor would sound like working swing would not move back forth i contacted maker swings welcome send new motor houseing they back order witch told swing crap swing went begining august i didnt get motor till begining october i contacted durring time said could send new swing i i would pay send old one back i waited two long months sleepless nites getting use 8 hours sleep nite and first november swing stopped working and im told i pay new motor i receved first free so end thing good swing i went toss old motor i cut animals mobile 
-1	this swing nice features the music , different swing positions , mobile unfortunately swing loud sometimes it sounds like working really hard it wakes baby gets loud my husband going see use silicone lubricant make quieter 
-1	odd , product seems high quality except motor ! it plays nice music ( i 'm easily annoyed ) , deep , well padded there n't much low setting swinging when i first put little one 9lbs seemed hate swung hard but i tried desperation one night i needed eat ( slightly colicky ) went right sleep so , mommy ate , dinner nap spot after two months use , started squeek ( annoying ) then shortly thereafter , stopped swinging she 13lbs 3 months n't weight n't use much after i looked reviews i saw many bad issues snuggabunny , even one electrical fire ! ! ! i would buy something reliable sad , i thought fisher-price decent company 
-1	i got second hand friend her baby loved grew fast my daughter 5 weeks 11 lbs first used there 's absolutely noticeable difference speeds , also swings very wide my baby girl loves wide swing , especially 's fussy car seat - relaxes instantly , slow one i long enough quick makeup pack diaper bag i nursed burped 30-45 minutes prior putting swing she swinging 10-15 minutes i heard fussing woke i went soothe see needed nurse started spitting tons milk it literally gushing mouth now , diet consistent , exclusively breastfeeds , 's never bottle , 's never bad gas , 's spit total 3 times trace , dime sized amounts there 's reason would spit much thank god i room looking happened could choked much i never use power swing which shame i looking forward enjoying if want something baby nap try fisher price newborn napper it 's takes less space , folds away , portable , rocks gently either baby 's movement 
-1	i surprised good reviews swing ! i think 's terrible first , 's huge easy way move around so wo n't moving quieter room taking grandma 's second , mobile bland baby see enjoy , 's reason baby toys neon plastic , neutral colors not excite baby no baby entertained three brown birdies mobile , mirror helps , bright contrasting colors really keep baby happy third , 's hard get baby ! the giant mobile controls sit right cradle maneuver sleeping baby cradle often wakes you get compact portable swing thing baby like 
-1	way big tastes i 'm sure 's fun lots babies baby not like she cried every time i put ! i think way overstimulating i & # 34 ; not sure i understand many & # 34 ; bells whistles & # 34 ; something supposed calming intended lull baby sleep there 's giant dome mirror right face bit mucho i happy return get small house ! it 's really cute i 'm sure people would love baby swing type , n't take i thought obnoxiously big 
-1	our daughter massive colic i would pop swing sooth at first loved ! after two months started slow three months use motor perished we returned another one would not even turn ! then returned another missing pieces ! ugh we gave customer service motor back order not helpful we ended exchanging swing baby items we never get item 
-1	we bought swing month son born one month later swing # 2 need return one the motor keeps dying it 's great swing sturdy plus interior son loves snuggle the mirror birds hang also starting entertain the problem motor the first swing worked great three positions 3 weeks slowly lost ability move we would push get going would slowly come graceful stop maybe 10 minutes it disappointing we loved swing i made return first swing obviously defective purchased second one same swing after first week , motion keep swinging front back the side side gradually comes stop 5 minutes i 'm astonished a really solid swing nicely made why ca n't company invest better motor ? you pay $ 100 piece value not main component we love swing much holding onto bit longer we going see long front back swinging motion lasts if dies , i return get another one ? i 'm tempted really tempted since i really like swing baby fits i love mirror different swinging motions the different positions put seat also great i even love colors it 's not bright cartoon-like it blends home really well hard say swings there i not get swing though sadly , i find another option we may end bright , rainbow swing corner living room i likely hate colors works son loves , two thumbs quality priority shame fisher price jipping consumer 
-1	this swing great son loved stopped swinging my son 10 weeks motor already broken fp sending new motor , swing expensive n't broken 2 months 
-1	my son loved swing , thing would take nap then 4 months motor died this frustrating us since i really n't want call get new motor - i n't at $ 139 , thing work , least one baby i definitely wo n't buying another 
-1	this cute aesthetically everything fisher price , must not market tested baby hates thing she newborn likes motion vibration , frogs croaking tinty rain sounds not soothing large 
-1	our swing lasted eight months i 'm totally bummed my baby loved swing much without boo ! 
-1	my swing 2 5 months old the baby loves however , last week , developed horrible squeak like tell-tale heart makes nervous 's longer safe baby i called fisher price order return , i mail not top part , two foot long middle section legs , requires rather large box , type i n't really want go find i 'm lugging around 11 week old middle winter no thank buy something better made buy store walk back return 
-1	this nice swing i 1 huge problem the music shuts automatically every 20 minutes this is frustrating pointless feature i ever seen my daughter naps beautifully until music shuts then wakes almost immediately , therefore someone must listening ( awake equals nap ) restart stupid thing every time the swing continues rock plugged saving battery life not reason feature extremely frustrating say least ! ! ! 
-1	this swing amazing newborns ! but daughter 3 months old 12 lbs motor longer works well speed 6 , highest go barely moves sooo frustrating since use naps time so i supposed buy `` seat '' swing post 3 months ? this expensive work 3 months 
-1	we fisher-price snug monkey bouncer absolutely love little one we purchased keep relatives house , 's not even remotely the size , shape , height , volume , everything different we ended returning found another bouncer version house 
-1	cute easy put together , light sound bar not work i received item i would returned , honestly , n't worth time newborn it serve purpose , i would n't recommend item 
-1	i put together rainforest friends bouncer unfortunately toy bar 's on/volume button defective not work the music stuck loud mode i contacted amazon replacement item hope next one not defective whether not deal defective product not , amazon used frustration free shipping ( typically i love ) ; however , chose put cloth item box without plastic bag covering box arrived 2 ' 6 ' hole there also small stain cloth makes think returned past sent me if next one arrives works i update change star rating i like looks product ; however , not justify giving good rating defective product 
-1	update 9/24/11 : i exchange item twice since starting use early july the bouncer seems work month , , suddenly , vibration stops working approximately 30 seconds turning i loved bouncer , given exchanging item i returned last time purchasing different bouner 5/16/11 : they 2 bouncenetts look similar , neither one bounce seat ( virbation ) make sure pay close attention seat purchasing order make ensure get seat want this exactly wanted vibrate baby young bounce bounce baby acquires ability additionally , mobile detachable , depending situation age baby very soft material , detachable seat cover washing , not large overall complaint : assembly directions n't great respect step # 6 there small latch-like items attach metal frame ( i assume keep bouncer tact ) , directions attaching picture follow horrible i really good assembly step horribly explained since every step baby items crucial , making sure customer understands assembly top priority 
-1	we ordered one discovered lights sounds n't work they sent replacement , guess ? same problem we tried energizer duracell batteries fortunately , i first ordered month baby due now , 's 3 days late , i guess i time order another one i miss ocean lights sounds version n't made it lasted 3 babies would , 4th , one big kids n't gotten broken it sounds cliche , really n't make things like used ! 
-1	loved overall look , idea , features chair 3 exceptions first , 2 wheels front chair none back , 2 year old able walk right chair push around dining room floor without problem i 'm sure carpet would n't issue , older pergo flooring n't present much challenge we bought newborn , certainly n't want sister sliding around room secondly , regardless reviewers said , t-bar absolutely closer back seat high chairs we even went babies r us compared chair ones aisle , solid 2 inches less space others lastly , tray loudest snap i 've ever heard maybe seems like weak complaint , sounds like thing breaking take 's way loud 's newborn ( 2 year old ) sitting right front in end , returned soon i could box get ups 
-1	i saw chair thought , `` wow fisher-price made world 's greatest high chair '' unfortunately i n't realize crotch post thing close seat back i barely cram 7-month-old , 30th percentile weight , skinny little baby behind it everything parent could wish except enough room put baby : ( 
-1	like another reviewer , i felt elated i saw high chair , thinking going surpass others `` ez clean '' styling then i got chair put 8-month old ( 50th percentile weight/height ) i could n't believe little room bottom seat ! the divider comes crotch huge provides mere 3 1/4 '' depth back seat opening provided strap even extend crotch strap farther , looping opening front/back ( depending perspective ) divider opposed cut-out , get 4 1/2 '' depth compare measurements graco contempo high chair ( happens chair i trying replace difficulty cleaning straps ) get 4 1/2 '' depth cut-out strap additional 2 '' , making 6 1/2 '' total , loop crotch strap opening divider i n't know fisher price thinking designed seat chair , , i extremely annoyed company 's lack foresight yet another great concept ; poor execution i felt kind frustration space-saving high chair replete impossible clean crevices perhaps fp believes parents make buying decisions based solely price , purposely n't spend extra bucks get product right order keep price product relatively low i 'm sure many parents like would gladly pay another $ 10 high chair meant got perfect high chair least something close you could real winner , fisher price , , blew i 'm returning chair amazon 
-1	what waste money ! ! ! this cover not keep baby warm considering costs almost half price ergo made better material the snap cover ripped first time tried put on although , customer service really good the quality product terrible made china

-1	like everyone else , i bought activity gym 's cutest one market however , mat thin use directly hardwood floors my baby liked grabbing toys short periods time , n't keep entertained 5-10 minutes once baby outgrew activity gym , i detached toys use playpen stroller toys today , sitting bumbo hardwood floor playing bird toy wooden ring she tapping ground , not even much force , wooden ring broke luckily , i saw happen could remove broken pieces tried put mouth i imagine could potentially dangerous wanted warn parents if purchase activity gym , i would strongly recommend removing discarding wooden ring least not detaching toy overhead bar i read reviews happening stroller toys similar-looking wooden rings , i would careful products rings i posted photo broken toy reference 
-1	i ordered mirror thinking i could use rear view mirror see son driving car , 's not real mirror 's like fun house mirror haunted house something it 's actually bit scary nothing recognizable also , stand flimsy , straps , making hard even use wanted i 'm returning 
-1	i bought i could see baby backseat driving mirror made sort cheap plastic not reflect anything in fact , not even reflective enough baby use fun the criters cute design nice not call mirror i ended buying cute backseat headrest mirror target trick fine 
-1	the item cute looking , little figures squeek mirror looks distorted definitely not like pictured baby see clearly but i noticed pretty much baby mirror toys it definitely not sturdy i hoped would just little fingerpush collapses the straps hold bedrail etc could bit longer well keeps coming due pull velcro i probably would not buy my baby not even shown interest and since 6 months ( she almost 12 months ) there definitely better toys entertain much better but want buy looks , definitely worth money - lol

-1	this fan ok i like blades foam , safe , case baby wants grab , pretty much get blades feel any breeze she likes look that 's plus , drains batteries quickly i probably would n't buy 
-1	i read reviews still thought might okay i wrong # 1 - save money these available wal-mart $ 5 97 , price high # 2 - the blades rip super easy when i say super easy i mean ! we bought water fan disney $ 18 , type blades sprays water blades better attached held together these blades ripped regular use i 'm typically pretty easy going stuff not worth , much i threw away park 
-1	this excellent regards child the fan soft little hands grab ( happened right away ) n't hurt she actually thought fun the side n't clip stroller properly part battery area keeps getting proper hold slids around n't stay `` aim '' it also glossy plastic grip we ended clipping onto canopy place stay while n't disappointed , wish gone different option defintely would not recommend someone else 
-1	seemed work fine clip would n't attach convenient part baby trend jogging stroller clipped shade keep 13 month old cool i worked outside texas summer he tore two blades within 30 minutes waste money too bad 
-1	maybe got unlucky , ordered three triplets ' strollers two switches stopped working day use third fritz we returned from reviews , seems like got lemons 
-1	i purchased third fan many years it job direct air daughter car seat ac cools car enough it 's enough keep roasting it 's made cheaply looks , however you may get season , wo n't survive one summer from i see , 's better worse stroller fans 
-1	son got hold clipped stroller well end foam blades

-1	blanket soft every time i use get thefuzz baby it sheds everything ! 
-1	only received blanket i ca n't comment holds i think 's safe assume wo n't last long the seams already falling apart upon receiving package i gave 2 stars 9 99 really soft i really unhappy silky material color it 's yellow i expecting ivory tan the yellow n't match well tan cream fluffy side but cheap least work little i n't think i ordering anything company lesson learned 
-1	new born baby couldnt use blanket everytime would sleep shed wake fuzz ive washed cant get quit fuzzing every 
-1	this product n't fit sinks it n't fit mine i could n't use i dont know well works 
-1	it works ok using top opening n't keep extender attached water running back opening causes pool water collect use when use back opening , angle extender points rather towards bottom sink 
-1	like another reviewer said when 14 month old drinks spout , collapses not sure quite aggravating i 've thought puncturing hole spout bigger i afraid flow fast choke water the bottle great agree another reviewer paint perhaps silicone holder something instead painting again , every time i try , spout collapses just not working us ! ! ! 
-1	when i started making baby food , i thought i would appreciate small serving size unfortunately , one ounce small anything really they quickly ended bottom baby food container options 
-1	once frozen , nearly impossible get open they little get good grip bottom lip lid small use leverage i spent five minutes trying get one open last night i decided enough enough they slightly easier open not frozen , still struggle i ca n't say bigger sizes frustrating since may give grip making easier pry lid , i not going spend money find i purchased screw top containers munchkin also flexible bottoms push food frozen i love they much easier open also microwave dishwasher safe : [ ] 
-1	but honestly , small mini freezer pots not pop easily i would liked product definitely not durable a short-term purchase 
-1	it leaks , 's great dry snacks , i using homemade baby food so not good fridge ends not perfectly straight maybe i not washed dishwasher 
-1	i 'm not experienced world toddler cups first straw cup 've used i gave daughter ( 12 5 months ) yesterday loved she thought flip cap pretty awesome got hang straw n't want put down until dropped broke the cup got fracture line near bottom 's totally useless if toddler cup ca n't withstand drop highchair , i n't know point just sent email customer service see typical product just disappointing update 1 : customer service replied within 24 hours said breaking like not typical sending new cup hope new one lasts lot longer 
-1	after reading great reviews straw sippy cup i thought i finally found `` the '' sippy cup beat sippy cups and fact $ 5 good true turns the sippy cup worked advertised - straw get liquid as reviewers mentioned , 's bit hard get liquid straw not that hard my 10 month old managed drink right away without issues the reason giving 1 star fact i 3 days cracked bottom dropped , i n't notice hours later i found huge puddle water table i really wanted like sippy cup i disappointed broke quickly i 've lot sippy cups one definitely took record shortest time entering house exiting house ( trash ) too bad 
-1	this cup broke within 2 weeks ownership thats i needed know not buy another i like attached cap cover straw , simply wasnt spil proff broke i 'll pass 
-1	my 1 5 yr old son loves cup for whatever reason , sees always wants drink but takes 3x much time effort get anything eventually gets sick quits it 's leakproof good 
-1	when i first got cup i washed well put water son drink making sure straw working ( sons first time 'straw ' i n't want discouraged ) i took sip wreaked of chemicals i soak overnight dawn my natural method soap usually works everything not smell then i try next day learned use straw ( got hang right away ) also leaked shirt when tighten lid tighter 's pain get when hold cup i see watch spill 's flowing i 'm disappointed get pay , right ? 
-1	i bought cup reading great reviews i listened negative reviews difficult suck i tried cup , i could not get liquid without sucking really hard ! no way could toddler get anything cup threw trash we use oxo tot straw cup perfect ! 
-1	milk spouts back straw all the time left milk stains place i thought maybe i faulty one , i bought two , cups leak straw it highly inconvenient ! my daughter likes 's easy clean , i 've also got one : [ ] much better 're looking sippy cup straw 
-1	too many nooks , crannies , parts clean ! milk also got trapped lid/straw area , way open area wash my toddler trouble opening cap , i always help i even trouble opening lid times it also difficult sip liquid straw i ended remove plastic covering valve get liquid i like size shape cup , many design flaws 
-1	i used straw cup put toddler 's water juice it leaks quite bit especially n't screw tight enough the unit also difficult clean many parts take apart so not toddler friendly afterall recommend skip hop zoo straw bottle 
-1	hip-looking , like something virgin atlantic would design , but ca n't take anywhere lid loose ca n't put freezer lid loose ( would result freezer burn ) i never put dishwasher , washed hand spoon okay i actually prefer munchkin 6-pack spoons stain less , comfortable grip , deeper basin food do n't waste time product - get glass containers snapping / spillproof lids instead 
-1	bought two n't work ca n't get stick either highchair trays granite counter tops reliably tried slightly wet , completely dry , tried cleaning surface suction use nothing worked sometimes would n't stick other times 'd stick countertop not hold place well enough twist bowl or i 'd get bowl halfway would detach i could n't get bowl separated suction so use bowls bowls pick floor 're thrown just like 2 dollar bowls 
-1	this cup looks like great product glace , not this cup anti-leak component , make hard suck essentially cup 3 pieces : rubbery straw part cap , anti-leak plastic component , removable straight straw the anti-leak component make hard suck if remove anti-leak component , straight staw way attach rubbery staw , cup point function sippy cup leaks the plastic covering cap good keeping rubbery straw clean , not designed prevent leaking if strictly looking straw cup hard suck wo n't leak or looking sippy cup leak , may you on positive note , rubbery material straw nice try seems gentle little one 
-1	loved design feel cup however , simply difficult 15m old son suck fluid quickly gave gave try see problem , sure enough even work really hard get little liquid come definitely not good cup use training child use straw as n't end using cup much n't go vigorous road testing appear pretty good leak proof everything aligned correctly 
-1	i bought great deliberation scrutiny well , disappoint the lid tricky ensure closed i bought pack 12 4oz mason jars walmart $ 7 98 i love , glass 
-1	these containers allow pop frozen baby food little bit effort the lids little tempermental though i never put microwave dishwasher one lids barely stays not want planned carrying daycare diaper bag will not purchase 
-1	of bath toys bought son , set susceptible develop mold reason it also feels not well-made 
-1	got 1 year old play bath tub they float face bath , small size , fill bath water 's impossible clean 
-1	so i loved spoons first time i used ( hand-washing package ) , i used feed little one cleaned dishwasher , warped i thought i put two spoons i used utensil rack dishwasher ( bottom shelf ) , i used two new spoons put top rack , also warped and not little , lot the spoon part ( food rests ) melted , handles became twisted bent so disappointed really worked great otherwise i debating whether i get another set hand-wash , i 'll vigilant ( husband ) little one , 's hard remember small details like that i also annoyed n't say package hand wash ( , i n't super duty dishwasher , heat sterilizing one - fact , pretty much n't clean dishes - dries i wash sink put ) i would call dishdryer instead dishwasher point : ) 
-1	i bought positive experience similar product 2010 i wish i could find product this not nearly good i bought lot , thinking would like product i liked 2010 , i made twelve ornaments product spite significant problems , not one time bad experience i experimented different kneading times different amounts pressure make print regardless , i not able create attractive product here problems i encountered ( 1 ) it requires a lot pressure make imprint -- pressure babies , adults make naturally , , firmly press child 's hand ( foot ) ornament make when daughter newborn , impossible i another kit saved later seven months it still hard i lot footprints , puts weight feet naturally hands ( 2 ) the finished product n't look great from distance christmas tree , would hard pressed ( pun intended ) make shape baby 's hand foot it looks like white circle get close and keep mind , considerable work get firm imprint infant even disappointingly , not make adorable , distinctive wrinkles foot hand it primarily outline shape pressed both clay product i used , ink pad prints preserve adorable wrinkles ( 3 ) the circle cut-out n't sharp enough cut edges cleanly at least problem easy fix exact-o knife scissors , irksome i sincerely doubt examples product box made kit alone ( 4 ) the circle shape 4 inches diameter my daughter 's foot nearly fills , tiny age seven months ( 14 lbs ) the average one year old 's hand not fit comfortable circle you could lose cut-out make , , irksome use products buy & # 34 ; kit & # 34 ; i recommend saving trouble if ca n't find better clay kit , buy ink pad preserve precious prints make crafts it look much better less hassle 
-1	i 'm sad chair n't work i hope product designers keekaroo read review make changes othe goodonce put chair together , 'll think , wow nice sturdy chair , lovely color/ overall aesthetic infant seat super comfy all true howeveronce put actual child chair , 'll wonder keekaroo tested product real babies/ toddlers parents here i mean : problems with the tray1 ) size the tray half size trays market sure ok look but imagine moment dinner plate not 10 '' 5 '' , eat pushed chest this like toddler dine keekaroo in baby 's old chair ( chico 360 ) i could place small bowl blueberries , small plate cheese sippy cup special circle indent on keekaroo , room , accidentally knocks bowls , plates without circle indent , cup goes flying ground , ends tears so i abandoned giving anything food directly tray , yet tray small gets forearms elbows covered food 2 ) this tray i seen requires two adult hands remove so probably thinking , need two hands remove tray , seconds put tray somewhere , baby safe ? the answer no the infant insert seat attached flimsy piece velcro this nice easy cleaning , i take tray hands , 13 month old starts wriggle get , seat pops resistance falls the 3 point harness , amazon reviewers mentioned , flimsy it snaps together low baby 's hips , not stop falling infant insert seat detaches this extremely dangerous problems with the footresti glad footrest baby 's legs would n't dangle however , big heavy wooden tray barely fits loose slots it 's wobbly baby rests feet , entire thing comes crashing now i one sitting close baby feed , one occasion crashed feet , leaving toes bruised i another baby way i could picture crashing we since removed footrest dangerous suggestions for keekaroohere needs happen make lovely chair functional safe:1 ) infant insert seat needs properly attach an inch velcro not good enough 2 ) the 3 point harness needs replaced 5 point harness 3 ) tray size needs double , special circle indent bottles cups heck , sell `` xl deluxe tray '' accessory another $ 80 i 'll buy ! 4 ) tray needs detach one hand ( examine plastic high chairs babies r us yes hideous look , 'll notice trays detach middle , leaving adult one hand free keep baby ) 5 ) foot rest needs secured screw mechanism 
-1	i really wanted like chair , n't functional , user friendly well made the problems design bother way seat belt goes infant insert leaves big holes perfectly placed food accumulate beneath seat then seat attached via weak velcro , getting weaker since remove seat every meal clean accumulated food the tray much give slide , ever 'locked ' position , 'clear protectant ' tape suppose keep tray getting chewed sliding locking mechanism already wearing tray showing wear slide locking part plus , two hands release locking mechanism taking tray , lame holding baby trying get chair dinner it scratching chipping finish also , i expected n't care much , overall disappointed did i mention using 2 months lame if i n't live alaska better looking alternatives functionality , i 'd return i pretty much keeping i saw , safest bet something coordinated dining room set wood pretty much form function , expensive 
-1	i loved chair first , even though tray n't sit tight ( time ) 6 month old causing change clothes completely nearly every meal stuff always slid bib , despite pocket landed lap i made mistake early spraying tray clean caused small spots corners wear puff up- 's particle board , la sauder brand , not solid wood i 've also trouble screws sides coming loose causing foot rest slide fall repeatedly- usually dog trying lick lol now i 've owned year numerous nicks tray , edge top surface the worst part though 18 month old figured undo restraint- simple push button tries climb even onto tray i 've looked several times see standing chair foot tray ready fall not safe ! ! if secure buckle , i would given 3 stars- look nice but i n't think 's going hold use grows , i hoping i previously fisher price healthy care booster i wish i kept 
-1	i guess i might like chair son 2 years old i want something sit 's scale regular dining chair i hope paid because 9 month old infant fails without cushions baby slides around straps almost nothing hold and clips cheap difficult somebody else said you could never walk away even moment infant chair then using cushions straps short ; 's bad design , straps go cushion not around sides i called company ask , nobody bothered return call email , put straps mail i n't know 're length straps chair already gee thanks i also agree matt 's review tray very flimsy attachment chair i n't know positive reviews come i 'm wondering employees post if i could go back time i would buy get free craigs list ugly plastic comfy cushioned graco high chair perfect babies , cares looks like , maybe get chair later use age 2-5 meanwhile i 'm feeling like fool put modern hipster aesthetics functionality hello , safety right 
-1	i bought kid 1 years old giving bottle i thought nifty little thing she 's 2 still ca n't seem get right she tries drink wrong side spills she perfectly fine regular lidless cup given using product i 'm saving 's older , maybe 'll useful car 's rambunctious preschooler 
-1	let start saying : idea genius too many kids using sippy cups way long it 's nasty habit gross see 4 year old walking around sipping milk sippy milk juice beverages drank table , not wandering house that said , helps kick habit offers little extra security lid the bad : leaks leaks leaks mason jars cheap non toxic no chemicals stinky plastic my kids n't throw cups i 'm not concerned breakage , 're also durable case fall but lid ? leaking disaster what waste $ 11 ! ! ! i mean cheap plastic lid n't cost much i willing fork extra cash something good nope bad idea i end , serve kids drinks table , lid , mason jar ( small 8oz size ) it 's less mess without eio lid the lid makes dribbling mess everywhere do n't waste money just teach little ones drink cup old fashioned way whenyoufeel 're ready 
-1	i figured since dresser pretty cheap reading given info could n't much opinion price dresser still way high if looking buying dresser i give fair warning might getting : most parts made pressed wood laminate the back dresser thin piece cardboard attach hammering bunch nails the drawer slides made plastic top board made pressed wood even cheapest ikea product seems like high quality furniture compared piece 
-1	i recently ordered three diaper bags , hoping one would work unfortunately ( fortunately ? ) bag knocked briefest look ** pros **1 it 's cute 2 i like strap options ** cons **1 it 's deep , side zippers n't open way 's hard reach stuff inside bag stuff in 2 it pockets the pockets decent , i need way organization inside bag 3 the `` four bottle pockets '' laughable -- opposite sides/end put bottle one ( say outside pocket ) 's no way 're getting bottle inside pocket you might able slip phone packet kleenex 's i even struggle get sippy cup pocket -- thank you when i figured con # 3 , i knew bag going back especially combined deep cost 
-1	not sure product ought buy a couple things know:1 the bumblebee lights sings song punch seriously , punch get anything unless 're training 3 month old box , 's not going able activate own 2 the flex rods hold structure similar kind used backpacking tents , except not sturdy after two months , one rods broke this causes entire thing precariously balance minute two come crashing son we 've got splinted chopstick duct tape , i n't think 's really working and five month-old angry toy broken i ca n't fix right i think 's going punch 
-1	i registered received item baby gift i could give stars i would ! i loved bright colors theme thought would good not great product given well-known loved brand wrong ! once set realized lights music not work despite yanking pretty aggressively previous reviews suggested it n't fact received defective item made dislike product , cheap toys materials used ( 1 ) the toys sparse not dangle low enough baby able grab holes toys allow use links address ( 2 ) the arches pretty flimsy easily taken boisterous baby ( 3 ) the mini boppy pillow provided made slippery polyester fabric made baby slide right - completely useless intended ! ! ( 4 ) the price outrageous if company going charge amount money activity mat , better spun gold least able deliver basic functions advertises ! i happy amazon accepted return i able get activity mat ( tiny love ) nearly half price daughter loves still using bonus ? besides fact works also folds nicely easy transport grandma grandpa 's house ! 
-1	i got i love boppy products quite frankly cute i six children i around block items like what i like it 's cute what i n't like , slick i prop baby pillow tummy time slides they may done wipeable not sure n't work us , sent back if want blanket lay baby work i one 50 blankets already : ) 
-1	we got one hospital i guess explains quality product right away awful design , horrible look , hard ugly pacifier , baby hates take ones 
-1	these terrible , n't stay babies mouth try mam brand , sooo much better ! i think anyone gives positive review n't tried mam 
-1	my son 10 months old now he loves 0-3 month green soothie - falls asleep one the 3m+ pacifier thicker harder- baby not able keep mouth he ca n't fall asleep 3m+ pacifier , slides mouth easily so got 0-3 month pacies and son never seemed want able fit 0-3 month soothie completely mouth chew piece 
-1	i see babies pacifiers im not sure able hold them my three months old difficult time holding it the pacifier extremely heawy ! ! ! ! may work older ? ! 
-1	my newborn ca n't keep mouth well it keeps falling he latch onto nuk ones lot better actually keep mouth would not recommend 
-1	i bought pacifiers 're popular everyone raves as soon i opened package , i noticed smell i looked package ( already open , late return ) said vanilla scented appeal babies yuck ! they smell awful plus knows chemicals used make plastic smell like fake vanilla i not give baby 
-1	my son looooves soothie pacifiers these , however not first years brand his one hospital still intact months later , advent ones cracked couple weeks ! i heard squealing noise sucking , i took mouth little cracks way around nipple part i pulled started tear i 'm glad n't choke ! i not buying brand save money get real one toysrus $ 4 
-1	i bought green , blue , yellow they fine except green ones said 3m+ , others 0-3m my ( 8m old ) son hates ! he thinks 's tricked he looks , sucks twice , gets angry throws i wish i n't tossed package even though 're $ 3 i would sent back if baby fan soft , squishy 0-3m pacifiers wo n't like the 3m+ ones hard , 're bit firm gumdrop ones also dislikes 
-1	1 piece silicone = easy clean however , shape not contour baby 's face shape nipple unnatural why everyone use ? they fall mouth even trying keep waste silicone 
-1	maybe 's matter preference , neither babies took pacifiers i see lots places though gave hospital babies n't work us 
-1	neither babies liked my toddler never liked paci my baby likes mam brand i hoping would use brand wubbies , luck 
-1	the real thing n't look good picture the fabric flimsy should bought halo wearable blanket 
-1	it not work either big little infant , baby big enough , baby n't need anymore never really used it waste money 
-1	waste money kid old enough hold heavy thing old enough eat fruits/veggies- cut small/ mash 
-1	the backing thin not padded it n't seem comfortable squished stroller my son miserable we ended getting baby bee comfort cushion supporting body rolled burp cloths he much comfortable happy 
-1	the product seems like good idea n't following two cons : - makes baby 's head torso hot sweaty- the velcro left rash back baby 's neck rubbingi returned mine 
-1	i received shower gift someone raved , installed car seat take premie home hospital it looks cozy , soft i 'd love one however , babies not car seats ! despite reviewers say ! despite fact say 's safe ! i baby 5 weeks early , premie , pass car seat test released , monitored o2 levels heart rate car seat 90 minutes , make n't drop low i put son car seat , gave nurses test he failed ( o2 levels went slightly lower considered passing ) we redid test next day , failed on third day , i took everything car seat ( except course straps ! ) , looked like kid squished ( point snuzzler i think ? ) , passed of course , 3 days older ( i recognize confound ) but , made wonder i contacted people safety types after-market add ons car seats , like , head supports , asked specifically one , claims safe despite others like not safe basically , nothing car seat straps even head stabilizer comes infant seats not completely safe the snuzzler does fabric 's behind baby ( least one i got ) , albeit 's not thick i agree i not think would push baby 's head forward , heeded warnings people i talked ( nurses , carseat lady ( google ) ) , also padding around baby push arms anyways , might ok keep baby comfy lying flat surface , maybe reclining jogging stroller ? i 'm not sure but 's not safe car seat ( car seat 's warranty voided anything added , certainly not special clause allow use snuzzler despite 's claim tested safe ) 
-1	head rest shallow not way could hold baby 's head not go top shoulders like picture shows shallow body support nice main part needs support head ! i sent back i not reccomend , especially small babies 
-1	its material thin the attach part neck area n't smooth i put couple napkin cover wo n't feel lays this product n't give good neck support newborn 
-1	the snuzzler pretty decent job providing head support supporting baby sides , flaws : - head support side ( shoulder , arm support/enclosure parts ) thick soft , back snuzzler really thin provides cushioning whatsoever i expected soft around i ended putting extra blanket stoller , then snuzzler make this - head body support held together velcro point attachment hard rock - happens right baby 's neck ! feels uncomfortable - if choosing use body support detach head support - exposed super sharp velco back baby 's head ! 
-1	my newborn n't find comfortable we britax b-safe carseat maybe n't fit well in case , hardly used 
-1	it takes much space make feel baby squeezed i n't use maybe good little baby 
-1	quality sub par n't match ones sold stores it 's i got fake version 
-1	personally i n't like quality towel feel it the treads distant felt really cheap on hand , friend bought one loved so depends really like try see 
-1	well , honest , i love-hate relationship glider i loved comfy suggly but i hated head could not rest back ( i 'm 5'4 ) seated semi good posture , could i scrunched kinda low snuggly legs bent seat but reason i disliked horrible creaks clicks gliding mechanism would make i tried rock/glide i even found metal piece fallen mechanism and make worse , noises inhibited process trying get baby fall asleep i honestly trying forget negative aspects , thought nursing second child chair made contact amazon refund i 'm thankful good return policy ! ! ! 
-1	this one 3 bags use cloth diapers this one not even 2 years old pul ripping separating despite fact 's never put drier i n't recommend product want something last 
-1	i 'm really sad i normally love sassy products one not high quality i come expect brand the ring shapes cute , plastic really lightweight , means 's difficult younger child hold pieces get ring everything always falling slightest touch at least , bottom weighted n't get knocked easily the really annoying thing middle bar not tall enough it not even tall enough rings fit - falls inside top ring , whereas slightly taller makes really hard get top ring remember , 're talking babies toddlers - n't greatest dexterity world , makes really difficult play toy overall , i regret buying toy would not recommend i going get better sturdy ring stacker baby 
-1	my baby loves swing lights stars , motor terrible , barely moves i 've used swing little month very disappointed , its also bulky 
-1	had given hand pack n play graaco , trouble setting we chalked old , decided invest another play pen travel did n't need bassinet diaper changing station , looking simple , light , quality product after reading pack play reviews graaco , joovy , aprica , decided go joovy ultralight we realized reviews people trouble putting together , reviewers discounted experiences saying `` must not read directions well really easy '' so initial setup joovy ultralight , read directions several times even attempting set it took us 30 minutes get top bars `` locked '' ( broken sweat time done ) , locked place , buttons seemed jammed would not unlock we not stupid pretty handy do n't know got `` bad '' one , not user friendly one would like we returned ! we went aprica haven open play yard the reason n't originally go reviews heavier ( i believe 5-7 lbs heavier joovy ultralight ) less square rectangular well , sooooooo pleased received aprica version ! it took literally less 5 minutes set weight difference not seem appreciable the ease set made way worth the breakdown play yard also way easier after graaco joovy , i ca n't believe could easy i would highly recommend aprica haven it high quality , sturdy , super easy ! good luck ! 
-1	i wish tray easier put it put baby already chair of course wants grab i 'm trying slide i get nervous i going pinch fingers plus remove pommel chair first it seems like 's easy scratch legs without pommel 
-1	for past weeks , i sleep pillow knees relieve pregnancy-related hip pain a regular pillow n't always stay place , growing belly i thought extra belly support would also nice however , pillow not helpful all the part goes legs small high -- i need knees help relieve hip pain also , loft poor the pillow flatted inch legs ( not lot use , right package ) despite 's price , feels like cheap pillow not supportive i gave two starts ( instead one ) i looking little extra belly support would probably fine 
-1	these pads not absorbent not useful night time use unfortunately , even though i not fan disposable things , best use disposable pads night time use however , even want use cloth/ reusable pads day , not absorbent start feel wet pretty easily 
-1	i forceful letdown , i always leak right till shirt soaked : ( they also show shirts 
-1	not sure product popular i 'm 5 7 '' 140 pre pregnancy 165 week 35 laying belly pillow makes hurt , baby hates squishes starts punching violently if like memory foam softer foam maybe 'd better another thing 's wrong incline wedge steep , gradual better comfort i tried behind back back support 's even worse , actually makes back hurt between knees 's useless 's hard wedge shaped it 's like brick just n't work 
-1	in theory great item however , 100 pounds 4 feet , thing useless i n't huge , come ! this needs double size support pregnant belly back do n't waste money 
-1	the pillow seems like would comfortable , i would n't know i never used once i took package , i noticed overpowering chemically odor i realize sense smell heightened pregnancy , odor reminded smell just-varnished floors , smell i came across pre-pregnancy i looked low-voc hardwood stain topcoat products this makes sense , tag pillow lists foam insert made 100 % polyurethane yes , polyurethane also used clear topcoat floors known emit toxic fumes liquid foam forms while i n't time look extensively science pu emissions , quick search came statement seemingly reliable source : `` levels pbdes polyurethane foam pillows among highest house direct exposure lead liver damage affect thyroid function '' further investigation n't necessary decide pillow go back - odor repellant enough also , cotton cover low quality , fairly flimsy rough the weave definitely n't contain odor/fumes 
-1	this thing lost rivet/connector broke first time used sent back n't get another one did n't really seem durable then kids pros destroying things made kids might fine little sissies 
-1	we ordered thinking would great seat boy camping around house ( know could sneak shower ) it came 3 4 plastic sheaths legs cracked worse cup holders/ place toys razor sharp edges crazy passed sort inspection would not recommend anyone the complaint people seem seat sits deep true well smaller torsoed babies may not really option anyway 
-1	by time baby fit well , mobile ready roam it 's neat idea not practical it needs shorter seat needs snug i also really annoyed surrounding & # 34 ; table & # 34 ; it sinks toys/food slide seat making baby uncomfortable fyi : i bought son he 's busy boy not want contained long this would great mellow daughter know time i recommend tall baby wants sit observe 
-1	i use go pod 're soccer game i bought i looking chair place 5 month old i washed dishes it turns baby sits , go pod sinks another thing i n't like material falling apart corners 
-1	bottle looks cute , n't work like advertised first , cap n't stay the nipple concept genius , one piece rim , plastic n't soft nipples you would think would softer , like nipple breast not much my baby could n't latch onto my suggestion , n't buy , 's waste money especially charging 
-1	my daughter interest bottle , even pushed away aggressively the cap n't stay , awkward hold definitely not worth price wish i could returned we ended simply buying latex nipples address bottle-refusal , worked like charm 
-1	our baby breastfed , supplement bottles twice day she 's currently 3 months old introduced bottles week old when i saw bottle , i thought , & # 34 ; wow , great idea , bottle actually mimics breast ! & # 34 ; it great idea , baby refuses drink ! she takes sucks stops so us , bottle waste $ 12 99 the bottle works best lansinoh momma bottle , also happen less half cost mimijumi bottles 
-1	this much better fact touch , seems like skin but flow way fast turn made baby eat fast made lo vomit every time used sham bought 5 , not cheep not worth money loss bm , liquid gold way important give baby bottles vomit everything 
-1	cap never stays 's always loose thought defect item got replacement 's issue tried putting cap different angle one point thought worked minutes later toss bag cap came off leaked bag messy would prefer tommee 
-1	the print place n't soft 
-1	i want throw containers not stack well save space the lids hard get i frequently use teeth i love cooler , wish ice pack hard plastic we n't freezer space lay flat usually 's frozen funny shape limits space cooler we use cooler containers silicone seal easier open

-1	i 3 months already broken it cute came mail but fell apart easy ! not worth money 
-1	i loved idea place hold teether able chew thing huge heavy she ends dropping going something smaller chew 
-1	on first glance , i liked item , color goes well decor but n't fit quite right there velcro attachments go railings n't fit convertible crib well advertised picture as result , bulge cloth middle it n't look great , job providing soft space teething however , soon son noticed previously hard wooden crib rail n't available gnaw anymore , n't use soft cloth teether , went side rails chewed ! i thinking purchasing side rail covers , go back rail , i 'd purchase whole system protect sides crib , 's getting expensive i think product would better made different material , soft not something kid likes sink teeth 
-1	after reading reviews , i excited diaper bought 2 try i wish i n't spent money while super trim , leak the leg gussets never fully fit around sons thighs , always left gap my son rather large age ( 3 mo ) , proportional he 97th percentile height , 96th weight he not chubby , skinny gussets never able enclose entire thigh area matter setting diaper set gaps gussets = leaks ! ! ! i never put diaper son n't leak i kept trying thinking would fit differently bigger got n't happened , i doubt , unless gains weight thighs on bright side , hemp insert seems absorbent put another diaper 
-1	i 'm new cloth diapering decided go big variety styles brands ( diaper cover insert , pocket all-in-one diapers ) i 'm satisfied diapers i bought except one after two washes diaper started pilling 's not soft anymore the insert even worse i 'm afraid ten washes turn brick also , sides disappear underneath front part counterintuitive makes closing snaps difficult the reason i gave two stars i n't leaks two times i 've used , however i would not recommend product 
-1	i excited get i carefully followed instructions , running hot water cubes loosen ( food never seems want come without little help ) they n't easy use supposed i found lids n't really offer good seal ( ) well , less week getting i made mistake asking husband prepare son 's food he another reviewer pressed really hard one end frozen food instead food popping , tray shattered now i hole right middle tray if buy , use hot water , n't try get cube pressing when use hot water , careful not get trays the lids completely worthless they n't keep water n't airtight i highly doubt keep freezer odors baby food tell n't prevent freezer burn - 'd airtight that i 've gotten silicone ice cube trays sure , n't lids , 's not like lids things actually seal well enough prevent freezer burn anyway 
-1	i 'm making baby food looking bpa free freezer tray , seems difficult find i saw one i made batch pur & eacute ; ed food froze tray i not get any cubes , not one ! i defrosting entire tray : ( not happy returning ! 
-1	i love concept , bad product n't durable unfortunately , tray cracked two weeks use i moved silicone n't looked back since 
-1	con : first , expensive price item phenomenal , , not the lid not `` seal '' ( nothing like standard tupperware seal ) food easily develop ice/be exposed air , etc also , let tray sit minute two slightly warm order remove food , i still forcefully pushing handle metal spoon side doing probably n't good food preservation sometimes hurts hand pro : i like small portion size allows easy portion control meal i 'm not sure anything else comparable convenience 
-1	after much consideration i chose baby food trays i followed manufacturers directions care plastic reading reviews i knew not twist trays would regular ice cube tray and fine , i not mind i liked capacity & clean looking cubes produced the last time i took tray cabinet ( empty room temp ) , slipped hand dropped floor broke for plastic baby product , not durable i would given 5 stars happened 
-1	i bought thinking would easier hand nasal aspirator not you use hands hold not hold baby hand , making much harder use mucus gone mouth pretty awful use would not recommend

-1	i thought would great bring along restaurants etc suction really works completely smooth surfaces ( like mirror ) not restaurant table i 've tried far top heavy ends floor 30 seconds 
-1	this really capture 's baby 's attention , especially falls onto floor makes crashing noise would great suction held 
-1	this really fun toy daughter loves , however suction cup not work well within minutes ( sometimes seconds ) daughter pulls right she strong , i would bet n't take infants much remove either 
-1	for reviewers mentioned item able stick well highchairs surfaces , please provide us secret trick ! i bought little toy excitement able stick highchair entertain little one meal times however , trying various tricks , toy still refuses hold highchair i tried moistening end water , simply pressing toy firmly , none tricks work also , i would n't call engaging toy it merely spins around , little beads make sound like rattle , little things inside wheel would turn i got baby girl 7 month old n't intrigued even , 15 month old , would play 5 minutes throwing back toy box with price , i believe i get better toys baby einsteins toys would play songs better engage baby 
-1	my son enjoys toy excellent suction i hesitant reviews i read , however , suction super strong i issues make fun noise too update : 4/17/14i ended throwing toy away son got older kept getting finger stuck somehow turning would start scream cry

-1	not fun 7month old , reason not pay much attention specific toy 
-1	the idea good unfortunately toys n't close well it take lot adult effort put toys together together n't suck much water my kids use toys cups least dry fully 
-1	at first happy using really rely accurate reading sick 3 month old useless the readings never right take temp spot seconds apart reading often degree different i not rely really useless point waste money 
-1	i 'd give zero stars-but not option i 'd return , i guess return window really small this thing random number generator it gives different reading every time 's big difference every time does not match readings type thermometer i loved idea , not product 
-1	i beaba pro 2x not fit the rice cooker/insert big fit beaba pro 2x i return it would 've nice seller made clear not fit pro 2x

-1	good idea , glue use less it n't stick plus i manage glue another adhesive , n't work waste money 
-1	could not get stay edited add - i using sliding glass closet doors , indoors , pre-cleaned glass , etc no paint , nothing interfere adhesive no matter i - fell i got really sick picking trying re-stick them if would stick , would nice product ! but , gracing local landfill 
-1	at first i loved worked , preventing two year old getting closet i 'm not sure 's design flaw son push door hard enough wings flatten door slide open they still stuck 's good maybe would better younger child 
-1	function latch works perfect the trouble adhesive n't sturdy enough latch falls door slightest pressure not recommended 
-1	these crap great `` concept '' tape n't stay put i pushed door ( pretty lightly ) popped right off- giving 24hrs `` dry '' - lol so popped took paint friends 2yr old could opened door issue thing installed ( 's great trial knowing need baby proof ! ) i knew risk- seemed good true- figured worth shot something cheap have find another product oh well live learn ; ) there not way install- could drill hole , n't really want hole closet door- besides , 's hallow door would n't work anyway and could maybe super glue long would last ? 
-1	a great idea , adhesive weak falls easily i stopped using month 
-1	does not stick doors we standard glossy finish sliding doors this product waste money 
-1	this first-aid kit joke a random variety cheap ugly bandages gauges , 2 3 drops either ointment vaseline , cheap ugly stickers , comes box probably manufactured store reading glasses if small kit need , i suggest buying little plastic box storing good quality bandages designs child actually likes , maybe travel size tube neosporin hand sanitizer you get use price , not cheaper 
-1	detour smaller toddler purpose stronger arm easily open door our son 2 actually able break first one get sister 's room i would n't dare put door i needed child 's physical safety ( although getting 11 year old sister 's room might considered safety risk ! 
-1	may good enough crib , wo n't give full picture twin bed unless 's across room but picture pixalated ( sp ? ) , ca n't make 's bed bottom line picture horrible if need one crib , try motorolla if 'd like one crystal-clear picture , get sharx it 's hard install , worth headache end 
-1	i older model summer video/audio monitor , video quality old model good , however i wanted upgrade model b/c move camera 's i liked added features however spending extra money getting setup house , i disappointed b/c video quality terrible - i could n't make details babies crib , could n't see binkie 's example - old model clear day , could see everything , even night lights - model not worth extra money i ca n't even see babies eye 's open closed - i returned ended going motorola mbp 36 model features video touch screen model/same price , however motorola room temp display , 5 lullabies play , big selling feature built data encryption added security compare day day use - summer better touch screen buttons easier see night , sound quality good , picture slightly better motorola - n't ton better summer video touch - neither worked great first model summer video - one new features older video quality , however n't exist yet so overall first summer video lasted 2 years i started problems sound cutting - price i paid , i ok at price new ones , i hope lasts longer 2 years 'll see , i think motorola better overall 
-1	we purchased additional camera monitor 2 kids rooms after awhile starting randomly shutting every days this happens charging charger ( showing 80 % charge ) called summer sent new one questions asked same thing happened new one called again- sending another one we 'll see third time charm if i 'll increase stars currently i give 2 instead 1 i appreciate willing replace , n't shut wonderful- good quality pictures sounds 
-1	not sure monitor companies make monitors n't provide clear video dark is n't need ? do n't fooled daylight pictures the night vision picture quality truly awful skip 
-1	i 'm second unit ( three months ) one starting die im simply going list short comings make mind -the unit turns twice every night , wake child screaming across house , not weeping monitor help 10 month old cant figure not him -the battery life changes day day i 'd say average battery lasts four hours so -the microphone occasionally turns daughter tells hear conversations -the range changes day day somedays go across house somedays barely across room -- every fourth fifth time turn monitor either displays dozen random colors , wo n't turn displays garbled mess two cameras accompanied large popping noise ! yippee ! so ask id buy thing , i 'd say absolutely not i 'd expect problems like five year old monitor 's since taken box , not month old second unit used 8 hours day -cheap chinese crap- ccc 
-1	the good thing i say unit allow hear see baby most time unless broken or battery power ( case alarm let know battery worn , point i get later ) so i third unit thank goodness i bought reputable retail store exchanged broken one new unit ( unfortunately would n't allow get different monitor i get one ) both times , handheld unit stopped charging i would plug wall charge ( use base ) would n't charge so i n't think i got lemon i think 's problem product the major design flaw battery runs handheld turns , alarm nothing let know monitor turned this also issue unit loses signal ( happens frequently , n't large house ) the monitor longer `` monitoring '' nothing let know in view , major problem ! ! ! ! the second time unit broke , stopped charging middle night eventually battery power went way when i woke , what point monitor shut without letting know ? ? ? i n't understand gotten many positive reviews please do not buy this monitor ! ! 
-1	this monitor great lasted we set three cameras watch three kiddos wherever sleeping , one camera main monitor stopping working two years the warranty one year something n't think need the customer service n't quick respond either days contact ( resolution far ) 
-1	i disappointed cart cover , friend buggy bagg amazingly padded , i ordered one , i thought i would getting quality , ! cart cover sufficient padding ! ! the package also n't look new for $ 50 i expected ! should bought one i saw ross $ 15 ! ! ! i 'm sure would quality update : i went buggy bagg website - product jr bag , pillows , padding , cover fabric - cost $ 15 opinion in order get good one real padding seen in the picture by the seller and amazon - need order elite one original but , could i known ? i n't know types covers picture misleading ! ! ! ! ! there is no pillow or extra padding with the jr cover ! the cover in the picture is not what you are getting !

-1	too small , n't work cabinets i returned replaced better universal locks buy buy baby 
-1	my son figured get cabinets 10 months old i would suggest measuring distance knobs purchasing otherwise easily knocked 
-1	i bought 10 months old starting open cabinet doors drawers i tried using keep closed failed i even tried putting differently thinking maybe i wrong but nope nothing worked i got frustrated i wanted throw away first , hard get close tightly doors n't open even i almost broke fingers trying close tightly possible the doors would still open that good daughter end closing doors fingers hurt aside , very hard open/close to pull close kind easy open back hard there small button side press time , push little button order release allow pull open i n't fat fingers i actually tiny hands i found hard it 's positive thing means lo wo n't able open lock but , painful open when i trying lock doors hard me i tried possible ways would n't hard close doors tightly nothing worked i would n't recommend anyone i might give try future maybe but 're stored away eventually might even become garbage 
-1	came package tear seam i kept anyway its white also stickers package left mark top i think i get one pattern next time 
-1	i found silent , not & # 34 ; noisy & # 34 ; enough rattle taste ( daugther 's ) she uses suck moves arms ca n't hear n't motivate move 
-1	they cute make lots noise crunchy stuff , however lean fall stacked kinda defeats purpose 
-1	nice idea dangle front baby plays way i like idea 's elastic kicks legs go flying i like sassy 2 piece wrist rattles set amazon sells although colors may vary ended pink strawberry bumble bee ( boy 'd prefer every one strawberry 's cool ) 
-1	the high contrast design fascinates beyond i not recommend product it n't fit three months old they not shaped feet fit awkwardly they not rattle loudly either 
-1	i bought 2 month old try she n't seem thrilled as matter fact , hardly noticed i not thrilled n't fit well they tight elastic ankle part loose foot 
-1	ok , idea good , way 's made awful these supposed put baby 's feet - maybe baby never ever moves ? is not like real sock foot shape n't stay baby shake and material horrific 
-1	~background~i purchased set includes foot rattles , different colors -lamaze garden bug wrist rattle & foot finder setfor 2 month old son use aiding motor skill development ~pros~- cute colorful eye catching designs ~cons~- foot rattles hard put initially remain stretched big - foot rattles not designed like sock curve the merely tubes fabric perhaps contributes not stay well ? - foot rattles keep coming there minimal elasticity socks keep sliding even socks keep sliding when son starts moving feet around rattles hanging come altogether - rattles bit quiet - the foot rattles bit large side ~conclusion~i think great concept , definitely could executed better unfortunately , son not really pay attention rattles this strange loves looking touching similar looking toys i would not recommend would recommend spending money something else 
-1	like others mentioned , things not fit kids ' feet they pretty useless foot toys unless kid really tiny feet , skip 
-1	i bought based reviews specs said fit table , not the chair would n't attach safely we farmhouse style table apron the chair fit apron , would n't fasten/ clamp onto table correctly disappointed if table apron , skip one 
-1	i ran test -- i put new medela brand membrane one pump valve one membranes the suction side generic brand membrane much weaker i tossing purchasing name brand membranes i give two stars work , not well original not worth save bucks ! 
-1	these membranes not stay flush enough valve keep seal , means pump wo n't work i tried several , 1 consistently worked buy name brand version instead 
-1	thought getting great value discovered pumping taking twice long milk would n't let these inconsistent thickness performance 
-1	after wind , plays less two minutes wind it son 's crib viewing pleasure rather soothing device 
-1	i guess either bugs hawaii extremely resilient product n't work maybe after looking closely contents , i 'm convinced baby smells like flower eaten 
-1	received slow flow rate bottle , slow son description website telling us slow rate bottle opt buy new nipple , cost another 7 bucks total spend almost 20 bucks bottle believe ? 
-1	these bottles great beginning ! they soft seemed durable we willing tolerate fact tip really easily never leaked and tried avent , nuk , the first years , playtex leaked ! however , recently started leaking the seal green screw part nipple longer seats properly such shame since stocked thought going go-to bottles we since switched momma bottles , love n't leak n't tip 
-1	we purchased several bottles marketed breastfed baby , i going surgery wanted make sure n't go hunger strike this one highest price , design silly the bottom bottle almost completely rounded , made hard set flat surface without toppling plus & # 34 ; slow-flow & # 34 ; nipple actually quite fast overall , waste money - paying fashion function 
-1	good baby willing eat lying love idea , milk gets stuck side bottle tipped way get everything 
-1	solely breast fed baby i needed take bottle i went surgery 2 months old i spent close 50 dollars trying find bottle would work ! ultimately favorite design ( reason getting second star ) hated bottle ! the nipple way long caused gag puke ! 
-1	i like feel bottles however ever time little one tried eat nipple would collapse it 's bad bottles not cheap i n't use much 
-1	the bottles looked cute , cumbersome 1 bottle wide big steamer machines 2 bottom part really soft tends tip over 3 the nipple causes baby takes air somehow screams pain 4 expensive 
-1	pros-soft , squishy , easy clean resembles mothers breast cons-leaks milk ventilation holes , hard milk reach nipple oval design , releases milk slowly tires baby still gives baby gas i switched avent philips pleased i really wanted comotomo effective states , unfortunately not meet advertisement 
-1	the 1st 4 5 times used bottles worked perfect time feeding baby afterwards , breast milk began leak air holes top 
-1	these bottles great getting breastfeed infant started bottle we several different bottles stock , bottle infant preferred unfortunately months bottles quit venting so i bought two neither one vented brand new i called company got response i returned bottles i guess trying something else 
-1	i bought bottles cause 're waaaaay cute baby i problems latching i wanted use bottles open mouth wide it help practicing getting mouth wide open bouts gas increased switched dr brown 's comotomo bottles my mom hubby knew cute i thought bottles excited i getting felt sorry crying gassy baby waited till ( conspired ( depending 's telling story ! ) ) i asleep ( pain breastfeeding challenges ) bring back dr brown 's bottles i neatly put away i woke much happier baby family again , bottles waaaaaay cute , fun modern may even help latching but baby problems gas stick dr brown 's whatever proven work baby in fact i thought dr brown 's n't working baby still gas pains but crying increased stopped using dr brown 's ! maybe i 'll try comotomo baby much older gas pains oh ! one thing ! they 're kinda hard clean the milk sticks material the product videos recommend clean cloth probably users stick advice using bottle brush alone would not suffice 
-1	i used mp3 player like twice after n't work it randomly switch mp3 mode sometimes 's plugged not switch it 's annoying 's whole reason i bought 's late return ! i see others issue there songs n't good i would not recommend product 
-1	the material nice , soft , 2 washings , elastic completely torn away material i order new one very disappointing 
-1	terrible ! ! these replacement lids terrible in fact , terrible product together the cups leak really badly 
-1	these not spouts i thought although , picture looked one side spout larger , n't fit nuby 10oz cups ! 
-1	these got job done , others commented n't fit well original parts it 's probably better replace whole cup , i issue throwing away otherwise fine cups i tried when hey n't work well , moved sassy grow cups , love 
-1	i really wanted like monitor it seemed like better design others we wanted work badly actually returned first broken one second the first one stopped working week second broke days luckily still fit amazon 's 30 day window returns electronics i read breaks deal company directly takes super long time who wants go month without monitor wait ? the screen also lacks stand , prop something good view in end ordered samsung monitor extremely happy in opinion , want baby monitor actually work go company makes electronics , not one makes every baby product could ever imagine 
-1	the unit low-tech the camera works , seems stay time there little functionality , decent cam the sound monitor not good the battery hand unit died 2 months 'm still trying find replacment stick big name monitors 
-1	my husband surprised monitor i mentioned i wanted video monitor at first i overjoyed , nice able see baby however , reception horrible the sound video would shut i could even leave room baby , even monitor charging ( turned ) hours it n't seem battery problem i walked closer camera , turned monitor , tried turn back video audio still i waited minutes tried monitor finally came all room camera sleeping baby i turned wireless internet house hours i still problem i n't electronics , aside iphone i glad fiasco n't happened night i separate room child , i would horrified monitor turned without warning i sleeping i n't able hear crying baby after reading reviews several sites particular monitor , i decided try another video baby monitor together returned product amazon 
-1	the reviews baby monitor actually quite good beginning year i put together baby registry we got gift baby born , i really excited my husband i set nursery right away everything would ready little girl arrived at time , seemed work fine well , change plans we ended keeping baby room first six months instead nursery , never really used monitor we moved room last weekend , guessed : the monitor dead door nail and never used beyond initial mounting set ! levana customer service useless we would pay return shipping buy another levana monitor replace one look decide want reimburse us ( insinuating 're idiots n't even know work baby monitor ) at point , i zero faith replacement monitor work better piece junk i originally received i 'm washing hands levana replacing broken unit motorola monitor instead 
-1	i box ready go back amazon pros : has voice activation ( vox ) has charging cradlecons : the video unacceptable - black white , blurry , choppy pixelated shame on levana showing clear color photo advertising packaging vox wonky it activates baby silent ( thus waking reason least six times night ) sometimes not activate baby screaming time battery lasts 45minutes 1 hour max , not beep warn powering so sit thinking everything ok not customer service - non existent your option return crappy monitor levana , 6 weeks repair what supposed 6 weeks ? ? in sum : avoid levana spends cash product testing as stands right , product garbage 
-1	we spent a lot research time baby monitors felt like `` the one '' the good reviews seemed outnumber bad ones like others wrote figured customers negative experiences got unlucky we decided even ignore long waiting time ordered product finally , two days ago , arrived husband immediately started installing playing different features one major disappointment 75 % time , camera wo n't turn 50 % time , sound parent unit half promised features work occasionally not again , huge huge huge disappointment ! we feel baby monitoring device easy operate literally plug-in-and-walk-away-using-it kind device - n't brood manual hours still not figure let alone get work so next step : i pack back return today - unfortunately expenses i got not lucky ordered seller n't nicest return conditions eager get monitor to sum : very frustrated upset ! 
-1	while digital baby monitor novel idea , execution particular product left unimpressed it sturdy , however battery life non-existent my ipod statys charged longer baby monitor and not rechargeable battery pack so best keep docking station using ac adaptor the display monitor adequate , bit dark i like voice activation feature though recommend pursuing baby monitor option rechargable batteries rather one 
-1	i not familiar brand , particular monitor pretty bad i would never pay asking price monitor the battery life terrible , image quality non-existant , range poor forget using dark ! it quite grainy sometimes , even 's supposedly working , 's not producing video , sound i numerous instances i laundry , dishes i thought monitor working , check baby find crying i idea felt awful i stopped using would not rely , even company sent better-working version i 'm sure better options money avoid one !

-1	out box i noticed gate could n't latch closed upon inspection , i noticed one corner not welded squarely making shape gate malformed this defect immediately noticeable without need install gate identify malfunction this denotes poor quality control we sent back bought gate another manufacturer 
-1	i really n't care gate much , i definitely not think worth money , especially not buy extensions make fit doorway ( buy 11 & # 34 ; extension $ 25 making total expense around $ 67 gate ok ) i read tons reviews baby gates ordering one while one n't great reviews , seemed one mostly ok reviews we experienced problems reviewers while trying install extension , plastic piece hole shattered the directions installing gate not good , removed gate , ripped paint wall , n't even use sticky things we ended buying babies r us step n release walk thru gate $ 57 sale , far superior gate it seems much better quality , fits wide doorway ( 41 & # 34 ; ) without buy additional extensions that gate actually goes 45 & # 34 ; it also much easier install munchkin gate we moved munchkin gate different area home , definitely not purchasing 
-1	this product listed sold diapers com actually shipped babyhaven not sure deal we ordered wrong size refused provide shipping label return item it big heavy item expensive send back so buyer beware shipping costs responsiblity return it i not buying folks

-1	as reviews stated , led indicator lights bright not bright , light entire room bright it looks like police invaded bedroom my husband tape lights next nights order different monitor return one it 's ridiculously bright in addition , sound clarity not great very crackly 
-1	the levana monitor basic it n't lot bells whistles , fine , n't sensitive enough young baby , not fine our daughter 4 1/2 weeks old sleeps co-sleeper next bed the monitor kept nighttable 2 feet head several times -- example , husband sleeping , i 'm kids -- 's brought told 'd fussing several minutes meanwhile , monitor entire time , i n't heard single thing that 's not ok -- 's awake fussing , i n't want get screaming-her-head-off stage i even realize 's awake if older ( louder ) child , may work but i ca n't recommend newborns we 'll going back avent monitor

-1	after playing around thelevana wireless audio baby monitor sound indicator leds ( lv-tw100 ) i 's not going monitor i keep using 's : the bad1 analog 400mhz 's easy anyone scanner listen in2 although vox ( voice operated switch means transmitter turns sounds certain loudness ) 's not adjustable so listening baby 's breathing etc only fairly loud sounds activate transmitter this may good thing folks not since i want listen whatever happening the good1 very small portable2 comes ac adapters transmitter receiver 120v may not appropriate travelling countries3 decent range should fine wood-frame north american housesat $ 30 's not bargain means probably get better analog monitor like thesafety 1st glow and grow baby monitor , whitefor $ 5 less 
-1	i put new batteries units & 1 unit worked i returned & amazon com quick send paid return ups label they refunded money soon notified i dropped box ups thanks amazon'i bought safety 1st crystal clear audio monitor ( 1 rx ) & works great

-1	i issue others i n't want cover , i want pocket i returning item full refund this place never get business do n't pay $ 25 cover this ridiculous i 'm unbelievably upset 
-1	these great two month old 90th percentile , grew around six months had buy bumgenius supplement loss i purchased 6 12 bumgenius various styles the bumgenius still work great girl still 90th percentile 28 pounds 9 months she big , review matters kid big 
-1	we used 10 pound infant tried week the double leg gussets job - issues leg leakage however , daughter tummy sleeper often tummy leaks , even short naps the solution us switch bumgenius 4 0 diapers they layer pul waterproof material outside and inside near tummy - rather outside with rumparooz lack waterproofing inside tummy meant constant leakage i love rumparooz sizing , appearance , colors - design n't work family 
-1	i like design thought but not functional manner i needed we used 3 trips store broke my little girl 18 months old 22 lbs she tripped course put little bit strain leash tore it cute fashion toy kid wear vs workable kid leash if wanted purpose i 'd give another star if want leash , consider something durable maybe stitching reinforced 
-1	this product good build quality back n't recline properly i compared images posted bobs website product delivered amazon strap hold back stroller together wrong place second one i got amazon wrong strap i contacting manufacturer bob see production issue i answer i update 
-1	and i n't impressed it seemed like could tip easily i n't like buy accessories separately this already expensive stroller come bells whistles 
-1	i ordered leave mom 's house visit i abhor using they far blunt it makes hard trim baby 's nails quickly , essential skip pay tweezermans 
-1	it not get corners baby 's nails left weird angle sharper end nail needless say , i buy regular baby clippers worked like charm i got safety 1st grooming set 
-1	i bought said safe alternative regular baby clippers wrong i ended slicing tiny bit skin newborn 's pinky , course devastated 6 weeks old i made bleed : ( i using regular baby nail clippers , yet fail 
-1	i used one i scared use nail clippers hospital gave for first couple weeks fine i tried nail clippers i realized much easier nail clippers you try using nail clippers first buy scissors feel still need 
-1	like several customers/reviewers , i also received multipurpose scissors instead baby nail scissors although amazon customer service excellent , item fulfilled not send replacement - would go hassle returning item hoping send right thing 2nd time beware ! 
-1	amazon trouble recently shipping scissors make sure get tiny pair scissors do n't try cut baby 's nails school-sized scissors ! now , assuming 're one lucky ones received tiny scissors , 're decent price however , time get dull start making ragged cuts my baby turned one , i 've searched second replacement pair suddenly cost scissors n't seem reasonable buy new pair every six months ! i finally caved bought pair fancy rubis scissors instead they make quicker cleaner cuts less work piyo piyos , always seem require lots & # 34 ; evening up & # 34 ; when consider 'll cutting baby 's nails least week , makes sense buy nicer pair these also plastic cover piyo piyos choking hazard you definitely want keep away baby 's reach 
-1	this gadget didnt really work , could not get attached adjusted made sense still didnt allow go handsfree spend extra money buy pumping bra 
-1	i like idea product `` trying '' it honestly n't work though the straps needed shorter it n't hold boobs , caused sag low loose suction this work nipple areola low , not may not work i gave 2 stars i like idea cause honestly n't work 
-1	our 6 month old boy tall age , i really thought seat would 've accommodated longer in ways i 'm glad outgrew always seemed uncomfortable seat he always smashed sitting awkwardly the car seat heavy carry one hand means leaving house , first i bring diaper bag car come back house baby car seat the fabric polyester , gets burning hot summer the ear flaps also get hot our 6 month old hates seat much i avoid driving car altogether at end day , peg perego uncomfortable seat could ever force baby 
-1	in exhausting frenzy buying baby stuff , sifting reviews , shopping price receiving advice whether requested not , one purchase i wish i took little time with it folds super easy packs well i like sleeping level higher smaller babies the assembly easy expected like types items 's going slow not jumping ahead steps the construction seems fine i expect hold long time i like lot things item , one flaw daily irritant not present models i seen stores since getting one the changing table not level baby placed the design cantilevered main surface , sags slants considerably weight this means baby rolls inward i tried several ways address found easiest solution rolling hand towel putting corner changing table top bar play yard this works fine , falls frequently necessary due bad design others i seen changing table supported much better it not safety hazard , build quality sound , ease breaking probably good , one design flaw enough disappointment i would not buy model i ca n't recommend unless not planning use changing table 
-1	i registered based description amazon matches description gracco website , deceptive the description bassinet picture i assumed diaper changer basinett instead bassinet describes extra level playyard wide open not cushioned , not really comparable bassinets newborns like sleep some models include `` napper '' vibrating seat closer i would describe bassinett i expecting i registered product as others said changing table attachment ( i thought bassinet picture ) not support even small baby i used son 10 pounds rolls edge making difficult change diaper there better models choose better prices i wish i would returned , i wrapped newborn primary place sleep since would fit bedroom i not fond mobile i n't think grabs child 's attention much , i find pain assemble reassemble pieces packing playing 
-1	i coming country babycook king so everybody beaba products so i got cause i found concept great i tried several times toddler ( 15mo 2yo ) she not hold flimsy she not roll empty contents when i helped push applesauce close opening , takes much almost chocks everytime the pros ease cleaning filling ( although , another review mentions , caps sometimes not screw well ) but pros cons daughter encounters weight way balance ! one thing , today priced $ 22 05 amazon i got maybe half price country made it absolutely not worth much money ! check alternatives 
-1	purchased fill pureed baby food found difficult use its actually relatively easy fill ( wish would stand counter though ) cleans great , daughter ( started trying use 10 months 15 months ) cant make work its hard get food ( not much fits ! ) i keep come help there pouches market use , silisqueeze versions ones i help ( i 've tried ! ) conceptually great product , n't make life easier since i basically sit feed 
-1	this cup leaks terribly we used twice , not using poorly works i continue hunt sippy cup 7 month old learn like grow 
-1	pros : straw kids drink sitting , even n't mastered tipping cup waaaaay back let gravity thing cons : *takes deep breath* here go leaks - these things leak that 's one thing 're supposed prevent , fail they leak straw they leak seal they leak liquid squirts - they n't air pressure relief hole , contents cup warm room temp , expanding air pressure forces liquid back straw onto coffee table if 're unlucky enough closed straw lid cup warmed flip straw back ready position , get nice 2-3 foot jet whatever cup awesome science lesson ( boyle 's law ) ! straw length - too short lots liquid remains bottom if 's milk , throw away lots sour milk remnants it also insures rather drinking cup dry , child plenty liquid drizzle around house , see above i would really love worked , sadly n't i 'm throw away two i spend huge part day mopping milk dots house 
-1	what i like : the straw closes lid goes securely what i strongly dislike : a robot must designed cup person actually used would thought good idea make bottom like first , straw n't fully reach bottom container , 's always going liquid left issue second , straw end middle cup unless 's filled least 2/3 , rest liquid difficult get tip even slightly third , biggest design flaw , bottom points middle always 2 ounces liquid simply unreachable sits like ring around short straw fourth , i n't know happened - mold grew inside straw not using days it must not fully dry 's 
-1	i specifically requested pink green cup daughter , however , got blue green unfortunately , schedule n't allow go returns/etc , i 'll keeping boyish cup little girl thanks 
-1	i 've purchased 4-5 different types sippy cups 15-month old daughter these received high reviews mom blog , i bought two big mistake ! both leak really badly when twist far enough milk n't leak top , pressure builds within cup , moving liquid straw , liquid straw projects straw go open i 've tried loosen top , leaks , i ca n't quite figure exact amount turning keep leaking cover also not exploding a sippy cup n't complicated ! also , straw short , lots liquid ca n't sipped ! the one good thing easy clean compared cup i like i thin straw wand/sponge thing bottle set , works perfectly lean straw but easy cleaning n't make mess leaking ! terrible , terrible , terrible product ! 
-1	i bought cup hearing supposed help baby learn use straw you supposed able squeeze sides water goes straw however , design cup recently changed the outside hard plastic impossible squeeze , defeats whole purpose & # 34 ; training & # 34 ; cup 
-1	awful would n't stay affixed corners counter tops lasted less week abandoned altogether 
-1	it 's nice thick , shock absorbent rubber three sticky tape areas ( one edge one top underneath ) n't good n't stick surfaces 're put i one fall wood entertainment center , another fell thick wood wall trim edging my daughter , 8mos old , pulled one playing if stuck corners , i 'd love since n't stick , go garbage

'' ! they claim products near-hospital-grade i beg differ do favor like pump full-time : call local hospital medical supply stores find rental i called around found unit $ 45 month i spending fenugreek mother 's milk tea try keep milk flowing great ameda disaster 2012 your sanity alone worth little $ 10 week ! 
-1	i bought pump hoping i could turn hospital-grade ameda i renting ( $ 65/month - ouch ) right box , pump virtually suction i lactation consultant i tested first time even surprised heard good units where i live , people buy medela - even n't get great reviews - i going limb buy brand anyway , besides lack suction , noise unit makes ear piercing the baby sleeping room needless say , woke right i hoping use pump night noise makes unusable disappointing i would rather spend $ 65/month ever long i need pump risk milk production i worked hard get going i returning unit 
-1	when baby born prematurely , important get breast milk means necessary i got ameda purely yours suggestion hospital lactation consultant they use ameda pumps throughout hospital thought would best hygenikit matched ones in retrospect , i probably done research pumps hand i use pump , i find frustrating it loses suction every 10 cycles , i need reset caps the valves finicky weak they supposed last 2-3 months , find i n't replace weekly , i n't get milk since i 'm still pumping 3 months later , i rented ameda elite it 's better , i wish i would gone medela pumps 
-1	in fairness , i not buy pump amazon it covered insurance , originally i thought wonderful thing , i ordered one authorized medical suppliers the pump i received slightly different appearance pump pictured amazon so maybe one better ? but one sold exact name one i received october , 2013 , i warn , n't waste money ! this pump give nothing heartbreak grief i got ameda purely yours second child born i lot experience manual pump nursing first child , i mention although i never used electric pump i not pumping first time for week two i got great results ameda things started go downhill i n't getting much milk first i suspected batteries ( since work i could n't pump near outlet ) , using a/c adapter home made difference little little seemed pump 's suction weakening it gradual i thought maybe i getting accustomed pumping becoming less sensitive feeling suction , therefore fact i getting little milk made worry supply going after 52-minute interrogation customer service , asked every detail pumping routine , washing routine , anatomy took lengthy troubleshooting process , established nothing wrong pump they referred lactation consultant wasted time telling nursing supply demand works , lack milk production i n't pump enough , even though i pumping every chance i got trying desperately keep supply she decided breasts large standard flanges provided believe , first probably last time anyone told my modestly sized breasts large anything so sent larger flanges , smaller ones kicks , new valves new silicone diaphragms tried , n't help i getting stressed milk output dwindled but whole time , baby seemed getting plenty eat i home nursing i could n't even come close replacing 'd eaten i away one night pump would n't turn i relieved i finally concrete evidence something wrong pump a minutes later turn , usual took 20 minutes get ounce total breasts in frustration , i got old manual pump 10 minutes pumped 5 ounces one breast ! ok , problem not when i called customer service told much milk i 'd able get manual pump illustrate milk supply fine , lady replied , `` well , 're always going get milk manual pump ! '' really ? that much ? then 's point ? ? anyway , fact pump not turned entitled new pump motor this one worked slightly better previous one , difference slight couple days trying , i switched back using manual pump exclusively i n't know 's wrong design ameda purely yours n't work other i hate , i specific comments the white valve ( delicate part ) ca n't removed hand you pry something else i use blunt end silverware i 'm home scrounge around makeshift tool i 'm not my lansinoh manual pump 's valve extra lip designed grabbed pulled without damaging something i never noticed experiencing inconvenience bad design as users commented , fastest setting speed baby 's normal sucking , 's way make go fast baby 's initial sucking get good letdown that 's if pump even gives suction 
-1	do not buy pump ! i got mine insurance free , piece garbage customer service good , product not work , especially supply issues i pumped one ounce total , hand expressed ? ? ? ? seriously , well could pump work i better squeezing breast ? ! ? ! ? ! definitely n't pay money , i would n't even bother getting free toys r us pump trade-in event , i 'm sure inundated purely yours pumps i would trade mine , husband wo n't put money breastfeeding point 
-1	the avent manual pump much comfortable efficient pump this one squeaks hurts hand i also always struggled get much milk i used traveled i start pumping three days advance get enough one bottle plane on last trip , i got fed bought avent pump i pumped four ounces one side less ten minutes first try avent that never happened ameda the good thing pump fewer parts easy clean but i clean often i needed pump get enough milk

-1	i picked inflatable spout cover others friend similar one looked like best protector - always full much softer harder plastic versions compared one okay- definitely not the two biggest problems 1 ) i hard time inflating ( whether i tried inflate spout ) the air valve sticks difficult get air stay putting valve cover it n't hold much air almost flat time i get value closed after tries decent amount air not `` full '' 2 ) our faucet pull shower not hole pass we use tub kids/guests not regular need use shower one shower could pain ! i keep cover serve purpose i n't feel like messing return i would not purchase one i would try another brand

-1	i hate come dryer wrinkled , i think 's thick they not discreet underneath clothing , i 've wearing home whenever i use i pull edges try release crumpled fabric 
-1	i really wanted like disappointed i purchased two brands pass first i tried i found itchy , even washing they sewn seam going irritates nipple causes itchy sensation the fabric nice seam ruins they also expensive ( also organic ) ones i purchased i also bought american baby organic nipple pads whih far les expensive , thy great ! super soft , itch washes great i n't recommend th kushies nipple pads - try different brand 
-1	this okay price it 's nice sell trial pack , i n't make mistake buying bunch the prefolds came set small unless baby tiny , wo n't able fold around baby ( usually wrap prefolds flats around use snappis hold place ) , fold thirds the diaper cover one-size it comes loose around dd 's legs time bit smaller thirsties duo wraps ( also adjustable size snaps ) the cover flimsy i also leaks blow-outs cover , even i use better diaper bottom line : this set stays bottom stash emergencies 
-1	update : changed rating four two my baby outgrew measly 12 lbs by i mean i not snappi using jelly roll fold anymore -- shrinking every wash , i would trifold lay cover , n't ideal baby still quite young exclusively breastfed this means i 'd poop exploding everywhere , i not keep changing covers constantly i 'd say go cheap durable sized prefolds cottonbabies , diaper-rite green mountain diapers these covers still great , though , even smaller babies , spring used ones ignore everything tag says wash least 10 times ( regular laundry , want save water ) using softest prefolds they not fit newborns , however , since ridiculously large i started using comfortably skinny kid hit 9lbs there still lot bulk/folding front/back the covers extremely cheap quality , job double leg gussets would helped , keep clothes dry , 's i care i bought four trial packs , another reviewer suggested , serving well 
-1	if new cloth diapering trying save money i not suggest buying ! they awful diapers if want cheap diapers go alva pocket diapers 
-1	these bags not good , convenient pump right know 're going freeze milk i found i use connector comes bags cut slit lansiloh honeysuckle bags works well , pumping better bag 
-1	when first child born 2009 , i started using pump style medela bags year regularly used medela pump & save bags market time i n't really issues overall loyal medela customer , happy various products fast forward 3 years i bought second child i n't notice `` easy-connect adapter '' i got home , i , i excited check first , getting hole n't smooth sailing second , i n't like angle bag hanging n't something i could change since adapter screws 's in end , pumping went fine ( double , hands-free less ) , i wanted pull everything they sure n't stand nicely counter , fact i worried 'd fall in end n't tilt , i totally see easy spill happening next , i noticed right away difficult get accurate read many ounces bag , i fill one bottles 's biggest problem occurred pouring milk bags , grrr the way would normally pour something bag like makes impossible adapter 's holes , instead pour one corners , flimsy milk easily spills either hole n't careful enough ledge bottle 's going fast i also attempted carefully pour hole thinking may wise , bzzzt , 's i spilled milk even though i careful so annoying i wo n't buying product , fact i may even throw rest buy another brand ( stick bottles ) since i n't want risk daycare spilling milk either i ca n't believe design changed worst couple years

-1	i agree previous reviewer days ago i many green sprouts products like , poorly designed unhealthy at first , seem great , moisture gets silicone spoon attaches plastic handle ca n't escape , mold grows very poor construction really disgusting trying return , seems ridiculous i need send moldy spoons mail 
-1	i love green sprouts products favorite spoons awhile they light weight , soft easy handle however , mold began grow spoon attaches handle impossible clean then i noticed `` green sprouts '' logo flaking not something want close baby 's mouth it makes worry `` green sprouts '' products the quality spoons really poor ! 
-1	this getting good reviews i n't see ? first snack tray underneath regular tray close child it leaves leg room my son actually , scratched leg hates i put we 6 months bigger gets less leg room it also easy pinch fingers putting big tray when i seat lower position could bump head side bar thing used adjusting height it dangerous chair and i return since i unhappy i hate everything except seat nice large size but , legs wobbly seat extended top position i do not recommend this high chair ! ! it also needs more toys to apply if needed the little pot is over to the side and does n't serve much of a purpose for entertainment maybe good for cereal but that is all ! ! at this price their should be some bells and whistles 
-1	drain ! ! ! dirty water piles pockets cool though n't enough keep i purchaed one drain pockets worth trade ! ! 
-1	's good traveling took trip got hole somehow inflate every night it not offer good support baby , watch super closely it also slippery baby kept going water would not recommend 
-1	i excited get tub i wanted something i transitioned 12 month son big tub this actually smaller infant tub the box says used 24 months , package insert says use 25 lbs , maximum my son slightly average , weighs 22 5 lbs 12 months we 'd maybe get months use it also much shallow picture shows it much shallow safety first infant tub 
-1	plastic odor strong ca n't possibly non-toxic little ones , i returned immediately upon opening package 
-1	i not like tub ! ! ! ! ! it gets 2 points cute , -3 no drain , too slippery , short inside the duck tub better , got car tub replace holey duck i n't realize n't come drain , really fantastic baby/toddler pulls maneuver causes need emptying tub quickly safety reasons i feel 's potential safety risk , tubs what disappointment , 's otherwise really cute pockets fun it 's also lot harder inflate duck tub

-1	i listened 1 negative recent review the instructions say wash damp cloth soap use i put mouth material make sure soap gone stitches around edges blocks terrible chemical taste , not soap i used ( i licked blocks i n't cleaned yet ) it appears adhesive used keep material together likely culprit these blocks therefore not safe baby 1 year ( i e , baby places everything mouths ) i alarmed selling babies put everything mouths i 've filed report cpsc contact manufacturer 
-1	do n't give baby it 's full toxic chemicals ( made polyurethane foam ) too bad otherwise 's cute 
-1	`` funny taste '' `` great idea , poor quality control '' spot reviews you ca n't help not taste something 's baby someone says 's funny taste like new baby clothes , toy requires washing baby play out 4 blocks , 1 not come shape block the sides one `` block '' shorter others the positive comments also spot `` brightly colored , little tags sides little hands grab , crinkle , etc '' at $ 8 shipping , 's enough profit better quality control clearly , people bright starts not thinking parents perspective i wo n't buy another products

-1	since 8-week old daughter one 40-60 % babies suffer reflux excessive spitting-up , i decided buy my brest friend ( mbf ) angled feeding pillow our pediatrician lactation consultant recommended breastfeeding 30-degree angle help gravity keep milk aid digestion unfortunately , first thing i noticed pillow i took shipping box noxious smell emitted ( i figured smell bothered much , definitely could n't good infant ! ) per enclosed manufacturer 's instructions , i machine-washed dried pillowcase first use , thinking might get rid odor but avail it turned smell coming pillow-foam , not cover i research discovered majority infant pillows , mattresses , plush toys , etc , filled synthetic polyurethane foam ( petroleum derivative ) , also contain ( deliberately treated ) toxic-smelling chemicals artificial flame-retardants , linked illnesses ranging asthma respiratory ailments , cancer definitely not good news parents ( like ) try make eco-friendly natural choices kids whenever possible when couple days ' worth `` off-gassing '' ( airing-out ) pillow-foam patio n't eliminate smell , i resort machine-washing drying mesh lingerie bag using delicate cycle low/medium heat granted , machine-washing drying synthetic foam tricky process best , usually not recommended manufacturers ( including mbf ) however , i decided risk i really wanted keep pillow give baby girl chance get relief reflux , instead returning item unused as utility item , `` slanted feeding pillow '' concept good one theory , case , execution falls short several respects for , main deficiency mbf angled pillow wo n't stay put lap in order baby positioned close enough torso breastfeed comfortably , i 'd concave stomach ! and honestly , new mom would ever stomach flat soon giving birth ? on top , 'd take really shallow breaths using pillow , since breathing normally causes stomach push pillow lap and unlike regular mbf breastfeeding pillow , angled pillowcase n't belt device hold pillow body this quite oversight manufacturer , since mbf basically pioneered handy belt concept it 's shame , since angled pillow showed great potential helping baby 's reflux issues couple minutes i could use slipped lap for example , daughter actually burped during breastfeeding first time feeding angled pillow it previously difficult get burp even feedings , aggravated spitting-up tummy discomfort however , pillow 's inability stay put severely limits usefulness oh well i 'll probably end using baby 's changing table prop head & torso n't spit-up 're changing diaper feedings grade : c

-1	my son born 10 lbs 're small start however , average sized babies would likely well 
-1	what say really ? they around $ 3 , get 2 pairs , organic cotton , sewn together rather sloppily reason bows - awkward boy baby i removed bows - n't even end using little large kept falling hands anyway by time fit n't need anymore so basically - sloppy looking n't really fit way customize fit i much prefer : guavamitts 1 pack neutral baby mittens : dots ( cream ) not look 100 % better , customize fit around wrists yes , cost 4x much might able actually use child still needs they made bamboo organic cotton also soft - reversible match child 's clothing

-1	updated review : so , 2 month use ( day , 5 days week ) i say even good thing pump i wrote first review , longer hold the pump disintegrate quickly -- suction not powerful anymore at first i thought good thing -- didnt ache much now pathetic -- hardly pumps ! there air leak , i not sure soft plastic inserts ( replaced ) tubes and frankly , i think trying fix problem waste money given poor product is everything comes apart ( soft plastic inserts , ring bottles etc ) , causing milk leaks even spills i would give product negative 5 stars possible old review : cons : - the bottles unstable they come ridicules stand , still not keep balance attached funnel compartment this very inconvenient since must essentially hold times , lose precious milk spill `` 2 '' their competitors figured make stable , cant ? - lots lots lots parts including tiny ones you wash ( i also sterilize ) , put together , take apart time misplace piece gone it like huge lego project adults ( 1000 pc 3d puzzle ) not fun `` 2 '' - because multiple parts -- lots milk gets lost way bottle plastic rubber folds this unfortunate especially drop comes much effort `` 3 5 '' - the bottles leaking ! they leak heat stored milk well feed after i reduced usage pump reasons listed , i tried continue using bottles feeding , i quickly stopped showered baby milk they get rating `` 1 '' , not give `` 0 '' pros/neutrals : - you full control speed intensity pumping you dont choose existing settings pump way feel lest uncomfortable continues you - fairly effective pumping , great pump sides time `` 4 '' - it uncomfortable at first painful , i either adapted pain found better way hold , unpleasant , leaves unpleasant sensation 15 minutes pumping session you full control suction strength light painful also light pump milk - the motor part heavy , bulky noisy -- not bad 
-1	being first experience breast feeding , i n't know different sizes flanges i bought one painful pump luckily friend visiting told flange small so i called avent told i could n't buy different size , used `` one size fits breasts '' model when i said , well not work , customer service immediately took information , emailed prepaid label mail pump back once arrived , credited entire amount product during time , i find another breast pump number different sizes flanges ( yes , i bought try ) ! to help , website gives sizes : [ ] overall , product n't work but customer service could n't better ! ! !

-1	i like avent pump , works however i wish i gone leading name brand pump , though 's expensive here reasons why:1 milk bags screwed directly onto competitors pump this equals less risk spilling precious milk due pour avent bottles milk bag frustrating ! ! 2 the competitor makes microwave sterilizer bags convenient sterilizing matter minute two 3 the bottles awkward pump assembled bottles top heavy flanges etc - leading even more risk spillage 4 the leading competitor makes different sized flanges - avent not i need smaller flanges i go pumping pals still n't best fit i 'm hoping medela flanges fit ugh so pump efficient good deal , lacking convenience department spill-proofing department do n't waste time money pump , long run 'll happier medela i wish i gone medela in fact , i might switch since i spilled 2 ounces milk morning i clumsy person anyway i need help i get ! 
-1	i used medela hospital giving birth prior coming home use brand new avent pump here complaints : - milk gets trapped silicone shields due suction when milk starting come baby lost weight already first days , every drop precious furthermore , i finish pumping go unscrew pump , milk trapped spills making messy ! - tubes short stiff making awkward hold-always untwist like rotary phone cord and bottles n't stand finish pumping i hold one bottles knees order free hands detach 1st bottle one pumps -way many different parts wash sanitize compared medela and i manually wipe thoroughly dry silicone parts towel pumping ; otherwise pump keep popping silicone cup attachment - use hands hold pumps place whole time i realized handsfree battery included one would far useful - n't even 3 months since baby born for last 6 weeks i 've pumping maybe 3x week i 'm mainly breastfeeding but strength pump gone ! even i squeeze way , n't seem suction strongly and i always keep readjusting breasts ( twisting , squeezing ) try 'help ' pump get milk it used take 10 min empty i 'm 15 min i definitely regret buying pump not invest medela 
-1	i pump connected worked 10 minutes motor broke it n't easiest get programing work i would n't recommend 
-1	i trying cost-cutting instead i nipple cutting it took forever ( 25 minutes ) pump 3-4oz thing ( unless i already max pouring naturally ) and i would try speed process , i would turn highest setting , painful i n't actually cut pump i would pretty sore sitting pumping long and loud- especially quiet house ! it would sometimes wake sleeping baby upstairs ! for price i guess i got i paid i medella literally takes 5-10 minutes pump 5-6 oz 
-1	i n't tried breast pumps , i read internet , better alternatives i cups , i guess call `` horns '' not come bigger sizes like medela different nipple sizes i took plastic inserts relatively comfortable i got lot painful , plugged ducts using 
-1	i read many reviews deciding pump went one slightly cheaper medela sounded great it horrible like others posted , deserves 0 stars forget million parts clean , 's not important if pump job i would n't mind cleaning many parts the thing matters pump n't work right i used several time cried barely milk came i thought i problem , , pump this pump constantly held two hands still falls the suction manually manipulated never consistent if stop slow , pump back it basically memorizes pumping given time , not ideal pumping settings such hassle i tried find hands free pumping bra would compatible machine nope , nothing works & # 34 ; horn & # 34 ; n't come like medela flanges i even cut one bras try make something useful did n't work , pump taken market after week , i desperately ran babies r us purchase medela pump style oh my goodness ! within seconds , milk flowing i n't manually adjust pumping rhythm just turn dial done put hands free bra works like charm what life-saver ! i wish i bought sooner , thank goodness i found pump it reliable months the thing i like avent bottle , i bought pump converter i could pump directly avent bottles other , stay away avent pump buy medela you wo n't disappointed ! 
-1	i not purchase amazon , i pump 6 months of 6 months , 's unused 4 i simply n't like pump i problems flanges wrong size ( time figure ) , one sides stopped receiving suction effectively became single pump it 's not powerful hospital pump ( not surprising ) , took longer express less show i give pump old college try , sore cracked nipples ineffective pumping , i ended writing pump loss i rented hospital pump point i much prefer hospital grade medela pump , i like avent bottles better also , pump , i highly recommend buying handsfree bra , like onesimple wishes hands-free breastpump bra , pink , xs-l having one makes pumping much , much easier less tedious 
-1	update : after reading reviews getting parts replaced , i called warranty received awful customer service ! they told ca n't anything i unscrewed top the warranty page 19 manual says nothing voiding warranty she pointed page 3 warns not open unit , never says void warranty all offered manual pump , i paid almost $ 200 double electric i need failed normal use 3 months i asked i supposed situation i rely pump work , could come i left work sent new one i ca n't stop working get new one ! she also kept equating television warranty , obviously go longer without tv go without pumping considering i know women exclusively pump feed children , i appalled make product people absolutely depend , claim ca n't honor warranty i depended enough i could n't sit wait when i asked escalate complaint , she refused she told supervisor , boss n't handle types issues what kind customer service center path escalating issues ? downgrading 3 stars 1 star horrible service original review : i 've using twice day work 3 months , using hospital rental first weeks home baby i love features -- great able completely customize suction speed time it 's also handy button right hand turn , hospital pump i always messing around trying get turned toe i pumps hand i also never problem getting much milk little time one i hospital pump unfortunately tell among cheaper double electric pumps a gear inside keeps falling post , least week , pump bag always includes pen-sized screwdriver get back place falls i n't know piece broke , looks like 's little holding onto post when i 'm work i hate i wasting time fiddling inner workings breast pump i finishing getting back work in short , tell put effort finding features would make easier use i wish made better standards quality , i need rely least another 7 months !

-1	i bought i starting making baby food son my strategy time make large batches food freeze thaw day day eventually i moved away strategy , i gave containers that the silicone `` bowl '' portion container sits plastic ring , screws blue lid the silicone bowl tiny notch supposed keep turning ring , 's not enough overcome force screwing unscrewing lid , silicone bowl turns buckles 're trying get darn thing open plus , ring lid small 's hard get real grip hands trying open close container it 's cuss-fest i ended using oxo tot square containers green lids store purees they worked great 
-1	maybe works someone didnt work girl you cant keep much grip rubber & # 34 ; bottle & # 34 ; portion without squeezing squeezing makes food come food watered come hole thin runs baby 's mouth worse regular baby food i dont like 
-1	its hard make food come , hard clean sometimes much food comes would n't recommend 
-1	this gift while i 've seen kids enjoy , n't work household we made baby food i guess n't smooth thin enough i could never get food whole spoon also , really hard fill nice idea , n't work us 
-1	the suction cup worthless , 's not baby come , simply n't stick anything the spoon fork okay , good size little hands 
-1	after reading reviews , i thought , & # 34 ; i bet i get bowl suction right & # 34 ; nope , terrible i applied moisture around rim tried two different surfaces , neither worked the suction piece not large enough support amount pressure needed keep bowl place in addition , divided section bowl raised 1/4 inch , wont divide much toddler learning eat the fork also not & # 34 ; fork & # 34 ; rather & # 34 ; spork & # 34 ; 
-1	i researched lot monitors , like humidifiers , n't seem great , moderately priced option i bit bullet went one , i 'm thinking returning manufacturer getting ridiculous i 've owned months first n't bother i think i newborn never left alone much used monitor minimally now daughter bit older napping crib , would nice able hear we need able hear stirs go try comfort back sleep completely wakes starts screaming unfortunately , loud static hear 's screaming head small noises lost static by time get , 's late 's fully awake upset there also bunch random beeping going ( even though units charged base plugged turned , ? ) the blue lights n't annoying many reviews claim , static incredible we live moderate sized corner apartment , static range n't issue what i hate monitors n't one duty - let listen baby ! if want safe able listen infant , look elsewhere update : i returned unit due problems the company gave grief i must dense understand signal channels crossing electronics , i told i sony monitor works just fine what heck , summer infant ? i 'm supposed keep laptops cell phones completely order monitor function ? ! funny monitor zero reception problems bottom line : this thing dangerous it turns without warning i think baby monitored i realize monitor turns ! i problem sets , plus static i safely say i n't get `` bad one '' rather poor design makes ineffective dangerous use depend , ya know , monitor baby 
-1	the monitor go range i go opposite end house basement & i wo n't able hear baby in addition , short battery life & must charged every fee days minimal use 
-1	camera died within 6 months purchase i called sending new camera i wait receive faulty one mail wait couple days new one ship kind bummer picture quality not terrific i purchased sale , kinda wish i sprung nicer one you get pay you get color picture room completely lit even colors extremely muted - not vibrant was somewhat pleased died , i 'm irritated 
-1	i 've owned two medela pumps , -- worked -- great they comfortable , portable efficient i also love parts easy get ; i need little valves something , i run target pick extras however , one , motor died around year fairly light , noncontinuous use the recent one purchased spring 2009 , second son baby he good nurser took bottle i work ( part time ) , i never pumped day , much he weaned end 2009 , time i obviously stopped using pump i put away till september 2011 , i started pumping daughter i went back work i pump day , well just days ago , motor suddenly stopped working ( my first also motor problems ) i tried troubleshooting ideas website ; nothing worked i called medela , first representative telling going get new pump overnight then realized pump n't brand-new , told nothing could , warranty lasted year , wo n't repair motor i asked speak supervisor , kept repeating warranty one year , nothing could ( they offer discount new pump ) honestly , i think 's terribly disappointing i 've spent maybe 24 months -- $ 600-plus -- using medela pumps , total , i 've purchased two pumps time , motors die ( incidentally , first medela died , i asked best friend i could use medela pump ; said , hers also not working right ! ) my third pump not medela , i longer recommend their pumps seem quality-contol issues -- worse , deliberately designed not last year furthermore , company n't seem realize many people actually space children , rendering one-year warranty not particularly helpful this expensive product short time lasts 
-1	this pump never enough suction i could barely get milk i ended using manual pump giving one away friend 
-1	i started using medela pump in style advanced baby couple months old store milk i went back work full-time i used lost suction ten months , used replacement medela sent another seven months after replacement pisa crapped well , i switched spectra s2 , , much better ! i 'll give quick summary pros cons first , details , anyone wants them summarythe medela pisa worked tolerably well first , gradually lost suction it never comfortable , efficient , lack separate controls suction speed made much less comfortable less efficient but i liked letdown mode , mostly got job done lost suction the spectra s2 way better , terms comfort efficiency given much higher quality pumps available price range , i would n't buy medela pisa again pros- letdown mode gets milk flowing quickly- great collection kit - 's easy find replacement parts , design makes easy swap different sizes , styles brands breast shields use one fits right the fact connector piece rests flat back also convenient 're setting disassembling store milk - customer service easy reach helpful - least helpful given product simply craps year less they quickly replaced first pump charge i called problem , would n't replace replacement pump died , too - can buy handy carrying tote includes insulated bag , contoured ice pack , everything need ( except hands-free bra ) pump go - can use included battery pack n't access power outlet if want kind suction wall outlet , 'll replace batteries pretty often ( every several uses , definitely long completely dead ) , option useful 're traveling pump car work - quiet enough use work traveling it 's not whisper-quiet stretch , use pump behind closed doors work ( nursing cover ) plane without making huge ruckus it also quiet enough use watching tv without making hard hear program it louder spectra s2 , volume spectra 9 , quieter hygeia enjoye cons- no separate speed suction controls this means unless want suction inadequate , pump almost always cycling fast - , milk would still freely streaming pisa would tug this means lot needless tugging nipples , means less comfort , less efficiency - not efficient with pump , took 20+ minutes pump volume milk i pump 5-9 minutes , far greater comfort , spectra s2 - pump gradually loses suction way n't particularly noticeable this real threat milk supply , i 'm sure leads women giving pumping - either n't getting enough milk anymore ( n't know problem pump , not ) , end cranking pump hurting themselves - from experience , pump seems pretty unlikely last year breastfeeding definitely n't count lasting second child for hygiene reasons , n't supposed use pump someone else , even setting aside concern , would n't want anyway , pump probably useless point it may sound seem like 's working , way pulls , suction long gone ( do n't confuse discomfort pumping adequate suction - definitely former without latter , probably , pump , less year ) my experience with this pumpthe pump worked pretty well first , though n't comfortable , although , like pump , always left little milk behind always took 20+ minutes pump , not including setup cleanup time i able improve efficiency comfort somewhat switching breast shields using pumpin pal 's super shields ( super shields medium ( pair ) ( 23-29mm ) ( accessory breast pump ) ) but first couple months , began gradually lose suction , less completely useless ten months pretty regular use ( 2-3 times per day , weekdays ) the worst thing , still *seemed* working point - still tugged uncomfortably , usual , still sounded the difference gradual loss suction - i realized bad i discovered i could hand express milk , pumping , i gotten pumping 20+ minutes , even much higher setting i 'd use i first started pumping i called medela , troubleshooting phone , agreed send replacement pump cost - also ship old pump back dime the pump worked well couple months lighter use ( i pumping 1-2 times per day , weekdays ) , completely lost suction seven months as , pump seemed working , except extracting little milk ! medela would n't replace replacement at point , i started looking pumps , i glad i - spectra s2 pump i , much better - much quieter , much efficient , comfortable , separate speed suction controls the thing i miss medela pisa compared spectra s2 pisa could use battery power - spectra s2 ca n't that super-convenient feature pisa ! but i 'd much rather pump works much better pisa daily use ( if need pump use backup source power , might want try spectra s9 alternately , manual pump might good backup use situations , find one works well ) 
-1	worked couple months then stopped ridiculous i went many batteries for item high priced , i needed work longer disappointed medela you worked good 10 years ago now thanks great 3 months i ended stopping breast feeding broke , i could n't pump work since n't work anymore my milk dried only able feed twice day not i envisioned daughter now , did work , worth every penny handy tote looked like purse no one even knew quiet fast comfortable $ 250 steep , convenience , worth for three months 
-1	i 'm sitting work pumping i write just like reviewers i problems milk tubing since day one i '' currently third set tubing past 4 months i called medela several times completely unhelpful they told basically wash tubing nearly impossible they tubing always looks cloudy gross i n't want wash tubing i want breast milk go containers not tubing 's i paid $ 300 thing my hospital lacatation boutique i called make appointment see `` '' problem when i went said `` not defect pump happens tim '' handed new set tubing $ 16 said goodluck i guess since n't many options choose medela not care fixing problem but gross unhygenic

-1	these not made toddlers like throw stuff floor day i bought , daughter dropped chair broke pieces not kid friendly 1 star cute design 
-1	the bottom part container likes fall pretty annoying but could mine shipping warehouse 
-1	this total waste money - nothing fits terrible clean find something fit i would definetly not recommend putting food for i toothbrush handle n't lose tooth brush good the opening not much bigger quarter look around buy see anything small enough slip the clip not stay clipped either - slightest tug comes shirt bib , pointless items floor needing washing wish i not bothered - total waste money 
-1	one year old not chew meat chicken bought hoping would able mash meat merely shreds chicken even , needs lot liquid put chunks cooked beef , cut nothing meat chunks got stuck ends blades happened pulled string meat wiping bowl terrible product excellent idea , poor execution well noodle soups - noodles cut bitesize pieces n't think justifies keeping product i see would well soft foods considerable liquid - foods already soft , n't need use boon mush it use risk , make sure get free returns also , clean not easy claims liquid splashes , gets inside top lid , sometimes inside lid chop hot foods , lid tendency get stuck suction either need super strength undo , wait cools down i returning 'm surprised good reviews 
-1	this first ever 1 star review it difficult pull mechanism , even much effort ( like trying start old lawn mower many pulls ) n't chop well it hard hold still pull string poor design , waste money 
-1	quite useless 
-1	the toys hard heavy baby when baby grab toy move , often hurts baby face 
-1	the nasal aspirator works well one comes home baby hospital i idea buy , effective 
-1	my daughter tiniest nose ever seen , aspirator tip small suction ca n't create kind seal infant 's nasal opening ( nurses say n't put baby 's nostrils ) i threw garbage you better one give away hospital save money product 
-1	my baby n't like sippy cup , may matter preference part however , big gripe cup never get lid straight because handles stationary , nipple/mouth pieces center but reason , i could never get lid straight mouth piece always one side super annoying 
-1	although pads get job done technically speaking i prefer disposable changing pad products the peewee pads pretty small unless child small mess maker n't cover needed area i baby boy waits take diaper poop i need sturdier pad these also wrinkle/ bunch easy thin good multi uses get absolutely nothing however , son little older not peeing every time i change diaper handy diaper bag but big enough butt , not whole body i still lay blanket first public changing areas my favorite disposable pads , although little pricy themunchkin a & h ; disposable changing pad - 10 pack 
-1	as another reviewer pointed , brica confirmed , sides bassinet not breathable 's not see-through mesh that means bassinet not safe use infant mobile , squirm non-mesh area side put face , could suffocate brica also says ( personal correspondence ) important limitations : n't use bassinet infant reaches 3 months old 15 pounds this n't disclosed anywhere product packaging instructions since package clearly shows infant 3 months old put bassinet , could easily misled using older infant this really immobile newborn for immobile newborn , travel bassinet easy use , lightweight , portable but keep babies safe , age weight limitations clearly explained , side fabric breathable fabric 
-1	note : when first got , opened let air 3 days strong vinyl/plastic-y type smell i absolutely could not imagine placing developing newborn strong chemical area resting breathing first open this first , manufacturer instructions state use 3 months max newborn starts roll move around well , pack n play crib , newborn could squirm 90 degrees swaddled the primary reason i gave 1-star `` folding contraption '' hard-plastic-scissor-type hinge there 's thin layer mesh vinyl separates newborn baby 's head just tapping side ( inside ) knuckle hurts , since hard-plastic i ca n't imagine newborn squirming rolling head hard hinge combined strong initial chemical smell hard plastic hinge , i ca n't allow give 1-star but i also n't like practicality not short shelf life , find visit friends grandparents , large bed surrounded pillows convenient our newborn 's squirming radius far away closest pillow , plus newborns ca n't crawl sit , feel safe sure , travel bassinet , practicality , one larger item remember tote around , whereas , everyone visit large bed surface use lieu of we also thought might okay co-sleeping nights wo n't cooperate pack n ' play crib , hard-plastic hinge design , n't want use this i almost feel over-engineered hard-plastic frame this could easily done somehow soft foam type material used soft rectangular ice coolers they rigid plastic , yet still stand hold shape unfortunately , reasons , i give 1-star 
-1	the poles travel bassinet made cheap plastic when assembled , product still flimsy i still n't feel like i could see well enough , even though one sides almost completely netted i would rather netted way around breathability viewing not worth money i would recommend summer infant travel bassinet ( i think advertised cosleeper type deal ) instead - much better quality price less 
-1	it 's not recommended kids 3 months older , means extremely short shelf life and honestly , i n't really see point why not lay blanket put kind blanket ? that 's 've always done , blankets lot portable ( easy set-up ! ) clunky thing by time kid roll blanket , 're past recommended age bassinet anyway , 's point ? 
-1	idea great , portable clean first time used bottom strap tore base chair i tightened 
-1	i ordered 2 year old not fit harness i sending back today small - says 40lbs way child big could use plus flimsy 
-1	we use times really n't hold baby well babies move around lot thing always looks like collapse it bends leans side i bought avoid yucky ones restaurants i find i n't really want take us time my baby heavy side maybe works better lighter weight babies i feel like i wasted money i wished i spent bucks better one you get pay 
-1	tried could support head n't work intended , head fell anyway bumper n't stay put great idea maybe girl small 
-1	i bought head support hoping would help keep newborn 's head falling forward could support head it n't , i disappointed it actually hassle put carseat well bulky n't stay place 
-1	we daily commute daycare 25 minutes long enough baby get morning cat nap i ordered brica koosh'n infant neck support hoping would keep head slumping forward napping the neck support stays place starts wiggling around , front pillow starts separate , leaving gap head fall fall asleep also , pillow not support weight head it might work better newborn 1 ) n't really move around yet 2 ) lighter head such bummer looks like great design good reviews ! 
-1	i brought fit baby wipes diaper bag this case short requires buy wipes n't readily available i returned case 
-1	i pulled box without unrolling , i could see two spots ti discolored worn-looking my first thought someone used , saw wearing , sent back if not case happened folding packaging , i would not trust hold tossed around car seat it looks like toddler could rip we decided spend little jl childress ultimate bag ( padded one ) seeing quality stroller bag that one arrives today if quality anything like stroller bag , well worth extra dollars this brica bag cheap , also cheaply made in good news , amazon could not better return getting new one upcoming trip excellent customer service , crummy bag 
-1	too expensive , saw better one walmart 7 99 also broke was unable pull shade back first attempt broken 
-1	we 3 total 3 broke short time one , hook broke , 2 not roll back part supposed stick window also kept falling i not recommend window shade 
-1	the mirror comes two different methods attachment - suction cup clip onto visor i using suction cup seems sticking well , though i 've days far however , image gives back seat incredibly small , much smaller regular rear view mirror i 'll able see general motion 's i guess side effect wide view i n't need monitor three kids , one , n't need wide there also small amount distortion , right center mirror , annoying if i find packaging i 'm going return , i may already discarded 
-1	i bought intentions using suction cup window back seat see grand child car seat faces backwards i 'm front driving it might work suction cup would actually stick it falls window within minutes i not get stick this not due cold weather its not suctiony enough thats word : )

-1	the adjustments n't stay place securely , like others said , require daily/frequent tweaking i trying install mirror new car hour trying adjust , giving not , already cracked i 've used months save money headache look elsewhere 
-1	this mirror nice big installation joke none 4 installation methods worked minivan i rig zip ties 
-1	this mirror pointless it mechanism aim mirror whatsoever strap headrest hope best i manage wedge plastic bottle behind mine order get appropriate angle , 's still not stable 's literally trashy the way mirror works convex include wide angle view almost has show baby ( even though n't ) the end result image baby ( car seats right front seats , mirror close possible ) tiny not show real information the image 8lb infant 's entire head would easily fit mirror surface 20 times , 's small if want mirror 're neurotic want able relieve conscience technically `` see '' baby , mirror , coupled ingenious use trash , trick eventually if actually want see useful information ( e g baby turning blue ) , 're better elsewhere 
-1	i difficult time keeping mirror place once place great i see baby perfectly unfortunately seems fall place every time i go speed bump turn corner 
-1	after reading reviews product , i really high hopes , i could n't get stay place my husband i tried numerous times secure , every time i hit bump , would shift fall the diono mirror much better design

-1	i product installed prius , not stay attached headrest- i readjust every 2-3 car rides usually i look backseat mirror crooked fallen side would not recommend 
-1	the title says we headrests cant adjusted could never 'install ' mirror we used velcro weird way get working it still unstable move every bump after 10 days buying/using , mirror broke may daughter hit legs , i dont know whatever happened , utter waste money i back trusting pacifier keep baby sane silent backseat sigh ! 
-1	i used exactly 2+ year old granddaughter removed here i not using this 1 my car seat passenger side back seat yes , i aware people say car seat center back seat , i disagree , n't right bat means mirror angle rear view mirror note : one pictures amazon shows child sitting center backseat the picture completely unrealistic shows would see looking back window car , not child see looking mirror aside fact mirror images reversed ( picture realistic , would show driver right ) , thing granddaughter could see mirror face ( i bent next see seeing ) to picture form deceptive advertising another picture amazon shows child sitting passenger 's side rear seat at least picture shows reflection child sees head 2 i installed rear headrest it virtually impossible secure nice tight not slip around fortunately i took 25 mile trip , mirror rattled time i hit bump 3 no matter much i played angle , best i could see granddaughter chin , bottom part reflection blurry shatter resistant plastic not close quality glass ( course would dangerous use ) and without second person backseat move mirror position , i found real pain i first installed keep go back position go front drivers seat see looked it not nuisance even one person 4 when i sat drivers seat way i normally , i saw top rear headrest rear view mirror the way i could see granddaughter physically lift couple inches driving 5 but ultimately led product 's removal daughter 's comment big difference shatter resistant ( like mirror ) shatter proof ( mirror not ) she concerned accident mirror could still fracture sharp pieces could become lethal projectiles , went note : one additional irritant directions printed extremely small print box using ink color not easy read this means save box keep directions instead easy read thin brochure bottom line : even not worried shattering issue , product n't work well , confirmed number negative reviews

-1	update:4/8/14 - i purchased two mattresses spent $ 500 expensive , i figured i would pay top dollar something relatively safer `` cleaner '' standard typical mattresses well , i recently purchased matching waterproof mattress cover colgate surprised i found it sold `` organic cotton '' , however label stated 100 % polyester i called company not good answer the woman said , `` oh 's organic cotton maybe 's wrong label , n't matter anyway cut get '' not the right answer i paying premium product advertised organic cotton , yet label n't state something like -- 100 % polyester ( exclusive surface ) anything like if selling product organic cotton , definitely would stating material label companies do so made suspect mattress , states ( looks ) like `` certified organic cotton '' surface i looked material label mattress states `` 92 % urethane foam 8 % rayon '' once , organic cotton ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! i really wish company would address issue i highly doubt errors labels if really product made organic cotton , state it original review : i spent long time researching different crib mattresses i two cribs initially received different brand best available babies r us i kept mattress secondary crib , wanted find natural , organic one would serve infant 's main crib mattress i purchased one several months ago happy there two sides firmness , different degrees - one newborn one toddler ( firm though ) there sagging spots crib sheets seem fit perfectly mattress there plastic odor like mattresses important the mattress soft plush , not waterproof , make sure buy waterproof lining sheets this may negate whole organic thing , i n't want ruin expensive mattress one accident 
-1	n't bother unless like buying $ 3 spout replacements every month oh yeah , still allow child suck like bottle breast feed , let kids use much past 1 , 'll delay speech development 
-1	i listened reviews i n't like sleeves open food get inside besides i n't like material i wiped got wrinkly crinkled looks really bad i bought bumpkins instead happier 
-1	before 8lb son born i bought thirsties duo snap wraps size 1 osocozy infant prefolds upon bringing home even though thirsties claims fit 6lbs-18lbs diapers bulky got way cord i went online purchased extra small diaper covers various brands when bummis cover came i loved looks , appears well made far sizing goes way ! it says fits 10 lbs i cant imagine baby 7lbs fitting newborn size i tried return could not i opened package , super disappointing : ( i also purchased xtra-small thirsties wraps worked great newborn- i highly recommend 
-1	this car seat put `` not buy '' list institute highway safety november 2013 it failed safety tests placement belts ( high abdomen far shoulder ) 
-1	mobi advertises use system security camera since view internet browser turns get 2 hrs viewing time month you pay $ 10/ month unlimited as babay monitor , 's okay not clear i would liked also , set-up internet viewing not clear cut needless say , frustrated debating whether not return 
-1	strangely , i discovered purchasing sheets phone product descriptions amazon app iphone not always match item descriptions full amazon com website nowhere item description phone word & # 34 ; flannel & # 34 ; appear hence , i thought i getting regular cotton sheets when arrived , i surprised find flannel i went computer look sheets , i discovered word & # 34 ; flannel & # 34 ; appear plainly full amazon com website , not app very odd for thinking i rookie n't know find item description phone , i not i amazon app guru i use app virtually everyday it 's quirk i discovered anyway , i ended returning sheets of course , amazon excellent customer service , ups picking sheets house 
-1	my son loves soft taggie blankets getting cold night since 's young blankets crib i looking something warm soft sleep this not feels like cheap cotton , not soft warm like i expecting does n't even feel like flannel i returned ordered fleece sheets price seemed good true , reviews mostly positive i bought right back box refund 
-1	i 6 months 20 month old not taken yet i 've tried showing scoop sorts things net - likes take things net instead using net catch things 
-1	non toxic duckies n't collect water ? ! sounds good true- right ? well these things expensive yet poorly made they disc bottom glued keep duck `` air tight '' water-proof well like reviewers already stated- stinkin ' discs come loose water getting duck body come loose enough water enter duck body mine got nasty outer disc body i wrote company sent pictures they sent 2 ducks defective i amazed badly smelled i opened fancy boxes i 'm pretty sure smell big sign bad chemicals present at least 's i 've read blogs `` off-gassing '' so end i 'm not sure ducks , boon great customer service they really since charge much single duck make grandiose claims product 
-1	these good size far length handle circumference i also like ends bendable adjust children tend eat left right hand now flaws make poor product , opinion the size spoon fork ends renders almost unusable the spoon scoop small shallow food n't stay spoon the fork designed 'safe ' ca n't actually stab anything my son enjoyed carrying around ( fit nicely hands ) but rarely successful eating assistance really n't anything advance skills we ditched uses also , soft rubber ( silicone ? ) piece around outer part utensils peeling away i n't know son picked , n't used many times already showing signs damage for reference son using 14-15 months old really starting try use utensils 
-1	these spoons great concept ! love colors ! that 's end positives negatives ? the bendable part spoons bends much , makes kinda worthless first couple bites and fork not effective poking things it 's like spoon couple awkward slots it if kid righty , prefer sassy less mess toddler feeding spoon we n't found good lefty option yet , though ! 
-1	in picture look bigger , surface area maybe size nickel and 's really shallow so time lil one brings food mouth it 's fallen 
-1	this thing way hard keep clean , unless maid help clean every day it grew mold less 3 days but think , not water go maybe company designee 
-1	blah- i really wanted love sippy cup ! we using born free avent sippy cups although i love born free ones ( also use glass bottles awesome ) i found i not need parts water cup ! it takes long put together wash unfortunately one year not figure cup at first i thought shape spout n't use kept offering thinking would get after tried i figure i would try myself- boy i surprised really suck spout anything come ! ! there way would work one year old i suppose would work older toddler ? not sure sitting cabinet un-used 
-1	this cup easy 10 month old hold , shake , hold upside it hard drink it also extremely drippy leaves puddle water behind every time 
-1	looks good like boon water bottles , n't work well really hard get water spout 
-1	nice simple design - two pieces it leak , unless extra regulator piece for cost , i ca n't complain this good 12-month old - right size , weight flow not fast slow and love one else playground one and one cup not roll sofa update : after uses , broke ! the bottom seam opened my daughter drop i n't think 's rougher kid i hoping fluke order another one since lot things i like 
-1	waffling 1 2 stars the shape really makes babe want use/hold/play bottle ( 2 star ) , slow leaks everywhere ( 1 star ) i would recommend using water it being supposed `` learning cup '' 's meant transition bottle cup , i wish designers ( boon others like oxo ) would make slightly softer spout kid could get used gripping easier i tried sippy cup not easiest ( harder use oxo , kid also n't much like use ) ; spout slippery angled , not even sure way a lot ( sucking ) effort little liquid honestly , seems easier slow leak mouths it seems like pain use first time learners : ^/ 
-1	it not no-slip i bought the baby guy reviewed great not slipping around table i figured would really challenging daughter pick up/throw it 's not she picked right threw floor ( along food ) once gets throwing phase , fine , 's definitely not worth cost compared similar items 
-1	i use extra bowls not stay put highchair described bottoms sticky tacky rubber baby picks us bowl ! lol 
-1	i ordered little girl 's nursery includes gray accents i thought would perfect stuffed animals 's already accrued however , i got box , lot furrier shinier i expected it honestly looked like i skinned animal put corner , especially since n't enough stuffed animals fill yet maybe another color would look cute child 's rooms , nursery n't match i going returned 
-1	not really impressed mostly toddler chewed tiny pieces already i easily see one could choke piece they 
-1	i n't realise small set i ordered nothing really fits , use plate snacks also two attachable smaller parts never stay , keep falling off/spilling not worth ! ! 
-1	i found cover leaky when i started using , lo already 8 lbs 22 inches long though maybe work better smaller babies for newborn , i 'd suggest bummis thirsties covers instead 
-1	i bought three newborn sizes small 8lb baby not fit mountain green newborn prefolds if i could , i would buy one size covers instead i like colors material , 's size leg gussets not work every time i would take baby would red marks thighs i recommend skipping newborn size together buy one size they grow stage quickly 
-1	while diaper right size , fabric needlessly thick leg gussets tight we prefer thirsties - elastic-y legs thinner , lighter , maneuverable fabric 
-1	received gift ( glad i n't pay ! ) my son much prefers kushies toothbrush one the big fins way able hold properly bristles not like picture maybe image updated show actually shipped customers just saying ! 
-1	my son drink cup close supervision , i wanted something could control i would n't worry 8oz water milk spilling place but n't cut i tried first , plastic spout , i could barely get anything -- still suck , discounts point trying learn drink cup so i took spout , thinking liquid would able stream , son could get used practice tipping cup manner ( instead leaving upright using straw ) except even spout comes tiny drips -- , not really sort practice drinking cup i probably husband take drill bit make hole big enough actually drink otherwise going craigslist used without spouts lids regular cups 
-1	my 16 month old ca n't figure use , nuk baby love soft spout cups not get hang one 
-1	i bought match theme baby 's room ( matching hamper , bedspread , bumper ) i always wash everything using but soon came washing machine ( i baby 's things gentle cycle & cold water ) , blanket pilling fuzzed in fact , rest load ( baby 's clothes ) covered fluff ! i re-wash load without blanket a big disappointment ! love colors design need made better quality ! 
-1	we got daughter christmas it 's incredibly cute returned cord power switch nearly end ! who wants stoop turn ? it 's impossible hide cord behind dresser 
-1	smells horrible - rubber smell overwhelming even washing we got thinking going similar natursutten natural rubber teether toy star , amber , sold amazon , not it thicker , rubbery sounding ( squish squish ) tastes smells horrible we going buy natursutten natural rubber teether toy star , amber , vanilla smell natural rubber well , much softer texture makes squishing sounds 
-1	we use natural rubber pacifiers thought product great 6-month old teething infant our daughter not like teether she puts mouth make face like give poison this teether bad smell taste , nothing like natural products 
-1	i wish i would paid attention negative reviews product i bought postpardum girdle side zipper at first , great i loved clothes fit however , less week , boning girdle developed permanent dents dug skin it left marks became increasingly uncomfortable wear it n't made anyone sits period time , new mother , i sit order feed daughter too much money spent weeks use i notify company not good product new mothers wear maybe pull support better way i spending money new girdle find i not recommend product i probably go buy good pair spanx much cheaper ( comfortable ) 
-1	i got pull right birth i put yes , i still bit chunky zipper popped instantly expensive girdle i would thought would held better the material seem good quality , money drain 
-1	i ended emergency c-section product actually fine incision - although make one specificaly c-sections i could wear short times ribbing sides killing i n't even make one full day work 
-1	the nipple pours fast 2 month old i researched see bottles slow flow nipples buying , however , i found tommy tippee website n't information flow nipples even offer slow flow very disappointed i not return bottles since i 've used one 
-1	everyone right reviews , sling way small buy according products measurements ca n't even fit baby i bought appropriate size according company 's size chart awful 
-1	this cheapest worst `` sling '' ever it 's not even sling cheap piece fabric sown circle all negative reviews dead do n't waste $ $ , many good wraps slings definitely n't one ! 
-1	i got sling website voucher free one -- pay shipping handling -- still n't worth it pros : it 's easy put get baby ( least would right size ) my son seems like since 's sleeping since i set there cons : sizing way i read reviews went size , still way small it barely fits 8-pound newborn ! the fabric n't fabulous quality either , though n't horrible also i 've wearing half hour shoulders killing ; throws entire center gravity downright painful 
-1	i used one & # 34 ; free -- pay shipping & # 34 ; promo codes i pregnant when i baby tried stuff sling , i realized way way way small i looked packaging see i totally measurements i provided figure size i needed nope ! my measurements spot seriously , i barely fit 8 pound baby fabric , , seemed squished 
-1	i got newborn within less 20 washings velcro closures completely worn they basically wo n't stay she ca n't even wear newborn size long i ca n't imagine frustrated i would wearing much longer since first baby i n't ton experience , i n't lot compare i n't know velcro diapers generally wears washed 's particular brand diapers i planning buying snap diapers though also , always covered pee wears so i guess 's another problem i one fuzzibuns cloth diaper newborns snaps i really like it nice n't remove insert washing though too bad n't work ! 
-1	i really optimistic diapers thrilled i found clearance $ 3 i using gdiapers twins 20 months since birth love i figued almost concept first , let say cutey baby inserts great i using gdiapers since start love the covers , however , different story the velcro terrible diaper stay babies certain pants tighter waists the velcro rolls back peels if used better velcro might something , though 
-1	the headline states colors may vary styles may vary , however given choices & # 34 ; animal , camo , dots & # 34 ; along size choices , would expect get style , color size able choose i ordered 2 dots ( pink blue girly colors ) , received 2 blue ( dots elephants ) we secure enough curls rock blue paci 's 's not i ordered paid for nuk paci 's best , love , wo n't order item seller 
-1	i really wanted like product even friends told i n't need separate appliance make babyfood ( use food processor ! ) , i went ahead bought i read reviews i knew would n't cook lot time , i n't expecting make mass quantities babyfood , make easier give daughter whatever veggies might eating night well i 'm pretty dissapointed -- almost everything i 've tried n't cooked needs i find machine puree food 's half raw , resulting lumpy mess i 've tried mixing food breastmilk pureeing , tastes like raws veggies pureed breast milk gross i also tried cooking food longer recommended times , i guess steam n't strong enough , 's never cooked enough i 've tried sweet potatoes , green beans carrots , disastrous results lesson learned - next time i 'm going cook food oven steamer throw food processor 
-1	i wish i could give less 1 star just got phone customer service i bought product ( gray center gray lid version ) mid 2011 expecting first child i ended barely using ( steaming ) child turned sensitive texure brezza could not puree food finely enough it sat kitchen shelf year , youngest ready start solids she less finicky , i using brezza bit - maybe 2 3 times week , i would not say 's heavy use measure three months later , bowl broke ( see review ) shaft started falling there replacement bowls available web site , i called customer service informed first model , discontunued replacement parts anymore warranty 1 year purchase ! mind lot people get gifts baby shower , time baby old enought start solids , warranty run what waste money ! i definitely not spending another $ 100 brezza this company obviously not stand product , i trust them i bought product 3 years ago used 3 months so far worked designed , i barely used fist child ; second i make batch baby food 2-3 times week more frequent use caused plastic parts bottom break drive shaft not lock anymore here comes kicker : impossible find replacement bowl ! the website lists replacement bowl orange center $ 24 states not work gray one , even not availlable so , i supposed buy whole new one $ 80+ ? trash old one still works ? ! if i aware start i would not purchased product 
-1	i elated receive gift , always wanting prepare baby food looking reviews , seemed like fantastic buy upon first use , plastic base holding blades produced hairline fractures food get lodged the piece holding blades also supposed easily removed food removal cleaning ; 's become harder remove use near impossible separate shaft the gray plastic , stains easily ; , handful uses , plastic , hinged cap water reservoir snapped approx 20 % time , device steam fail blend 
-1	i got baby brezza 6 months ago , time start introducing solids baby boy back reviews 5 star , i super excited get item thought worth higher price well , 's not the main reason i got item i could make vegetable meat purees one steamer/blender in product review stated machine used meat fish it ca n't in operating manual says used ground meat , i n't like i thought maybe i cook meat separately put brezza blend veggies well , could n't either it could n't handle blending even soft turkey breast would quit several seconds having stand hold button also annoying i extremely disappointed brezza wanted return , seller i got would n't accept returns open box anyway , i use brezza steam vegetables i cook meats separately finish blender after 6 months ca n't blend even soft vegetables , way so basically i paid $ 100 vegetable steamer , simple pot 
-1	i guess 's true ignorance bliss i loved using new brezza past couple weeks so easy operate little clean recently i came across reviews coating water reservoir flaking as result i looked last meal prep sure enough , i saw tiny little silver flakes it almost looks like oily water good lighting see silver bits i rinsed 5 times still see flakes i 'm concerned i spent $ 100 machine unlike parent wants know coating chemically made , i n't really care i n't think 's acceptable any coating come whether 's 'safe ' not i intention using anymore 
-1	i purchased returned defective even functioning & # 34 ; properly , & # 34 ; i found not worth hassle it took quite cook anything , far easier cook stove mash masher fork perfect example fatuation gadgets 
-1	i received baby shower gift excited i wanted make baby food fast forward 6 months i got use 2 weeks died it stopped steaming entirely the concept great - one step baby food maker small batches i 've making baby food old fashioned pot steamer blender i make bigger batches freeze i really n't want another product since son eating little chunks food soon the puree baby stage n't last long i would not recommend product 
-1	so idea great but i third baby brezza thing poorly made the motor drive not properly protected , liquids get , creates mess causes drive cease the bowl absolutely cheap plastic , cracks chips easily if buy product , probably find brilliant idea you however notice cheaply made piece junk not worth anything close $ 100 
-1	even though almost fits graco chair padded looks picture , cover padding , plain fabric i needed change son 's high chair cover badly i but look better options 
-1	i loved design carrier hurted back shoulder badly wearing 10 minutes my baby 4 months old way straps adjusted fit body baby baby wasnt tightly wraped body this resulted pulling forward i believe caused back straining i really wished worked pretty wear 
-1	i big expectations dryer balls however , severely disappointed they made loads laundry i used filled static i better luck using nothing dryer i put 
-1	1 `` steady , non-slip base keeps spills minimum '' not even close ! there nothing none-slip plate - slides high-chair tray ( ) easily 2 `` plate ring separate ease cleaning '' ring useless best annoying worst it one thing baby pull plate launch floor why detachable makes sense all 3 the walls around compartment far low - food gets pushed together quickly baby n't mind food mixed together , whole point plate sections increase chances food staying separate , despite baby 's pushing around spoon this cute looking plate , experience functionality usefulness poor 
-1	i excited product features willing give try even though expensive container i take toddler babysitter every day i pack food , i always looking good containers lids this product fell short the container small , holds little food maybe good 4-6 month old baby certainly not suitable lunch 12 month old i freeze homemade baby food ice cub trays , not even close lid not deep enough ice cub however , biggest complaint container lid not actually stay it not close tight food spilled several occasions we use home , longer trust taking lunch bag outings day care on plus side , gripping bottom pretty neat , i like rim feature , makes easier get food spoon 
-1	the size not i expected the quality brand uncontestable i many products 
-1	obviously need clean straw cups within week using long piece clean actual straw insert came apart not well made 
-1	it cleans like cheapest brushes would straws sippys i thought i would better quality product i bought item bit others , straw part came handle , doesnt seem protected rusting even dry doesnt help i used 4 times broke really disappointing i couldve bought another one cheaper gotten maybe uses still gotten rust breaking later nothing special 
-1	the idea great i happy oxo tot things this tight little fingers get , plastic stiff 
-1	these not good cheerios children like shake things - lot my son always shaking food - i n't even know dog probably ate 
-1	its hard get food , i tried i also hard time use cup without cover my son not messy this cup n't work us 
-1	i not recommend i normally love things oxo , huge fail when first got , soft plastic top opens hard 14 month old son could not get hand grab 's almost year later , plastic permanently open 's fall everywhere tips super annoying the munchkin snack trap seems like much better product 
-1	not last long plastic edges started crack could fallen food would not buy not worth money update 2 yrs : half lids cracked i not use anymore find small pyrex containers best fine freezing , 
-1	at first thought item great , however using several lids break within couple days made change mind the green lid thin , freeze baby food drops falls freezer lid breaks longer use store baby food 
-1	i ordered product take beach 7 month old twins the first item torn seams 3 places very strong unpleasant musty odor because time i returned item requested exchange the new item ripped seam 2 places strong unpleasant odor appeared several grease stains bottom i return 2nd tent i requesting refund i disappointed tent without problems would cute fun however , even tent n't torn not smell musty i would felt i paid item the color not pictured quality appears cheaply made 
-1	cotton doublers not absorbent hemp ones lighter colorful not useful needs 
-1	i bought toddler recently soaking cloth diaper every time wears one night time cloth impossible year i hopeful would help i n't find absorbant microfiber inserts i currently use diapers having use addition current microfiber inserts , doens't seem absorbant using two microfiber inserts i unimpressed i agree reviewers soft , nice but less trim absorbant microfiber inserts/doublers came diapers 
-1	the color make not good enough looks not stable 's head side i put water 
-1	this product whole bunch cool looking ducks problem & # 8230 ; it smells like chemicals smell n't go away matter long gas is safe kids ? 
-1	i really wanted like n't going work the concept awesome i wish alternatives one misses mark the biggest issue , like others previously pointed , lid difficult screw the three cups easily disconnect reconnect lid takes effort want threads line right way ( side note , cups unscrew pretty smoothly i think maybe would become less secure time ) i n't time worry making sure lid screwed properly every time i use not increase likelihood spilled snacks also leads believe would go stale quickly due poor seal i continue look something similar holds larger amount snacks 
-1	maybe i 'm new parent game n't built tolerance things difficult/annoying adapters ( yes , i installed correctly ) really awkward fit maxi cosi mico cameleon stroller like , i ca n't really get seat off stroller base myself so , i 'm faced 2 options:1 not leaving house without husband this strategy 3 weeks , leaving bored enough write review 2 buying different car seat hoping fits better stroller since less expensive 2 itemsvery confusing adapters considered solution `` situation '' ( quote faq section bugaboo website , pretty accurate ) update : thinking maybe carseat model old went babies r us try adapters newest model seat alas , terrible fit i gave bought graco adapters graco carseat used fit incredible comparatively the 2 remaining stars diapers com great letting return maxi cosi adapters 
-1	the first pack i bought great the second pack sewn oddly oval shape ( rather circle ) i n't think much i washed second pack odd ridge/fold/crease fleece-side goes right across middle ! i 'm not sure one sides shrank two layers n't even it makes pads nearly unusable puts odd pressure nipples [ thinks seam piece clothing ] i n't know i got odd pack not sure whether i want chance third pack see second fluke the first pack holding decently , though using lanolin make pilling fleece , cosmetic issue ( i n't care ) it n't make pads uncomfortable these pads dry well dryer another brand reusable pads ( cotton ) never feel like dry way *** update : these pads definitely rough wash times fleece pills : ( 
-1	i got go mia moda stroller , would not stay place it kept sliding straps 
-1	these silly small n't outer lip snacks fit correctly they 've turned & # 34 ; pretend play & # 34 ; plates not actual food use i like green eats bowls though good size kid size portion crackers berries 
-1	way big baby starting use cup toddler disappointed exactly i l 
-1	i gave away within week unless newborn really food fit bowl 
-1	i bought purchasing bugaboo donkey unfortunately not sit right handles it flops & cumbersome i wish i still packaging return n't use just attach diaper bag & use pockets n't sit right 
-1	the organizer attaches bee two positions ; behind seat push bar i first installed behind seat however , belt attaches organizer sides quickly got loose within several days , organizer starting sag it got way access break/foot pedal time i opened stroller within week , i decided try option the push bar installation method straight forward , pair velcro loop secured unit directly onto horizontal push bar however , attaches close bar i could not get hands around bar push stroller ! i ended going back old organizer came $ 75 car seat frame 2 weeks i not speak models bugaboo , not get product bee 
-1	i bought liked newborn covers -- fit right little 6-lb baby girl newborn prefolds kissaluv newborn fitted diapers however one-size covers fit 10lb baby poorly when i fold smallest medium size , garter around leg holes gets really bulky no leaks though even larger setting garter marks around thighs quite skinny legs the thirsties x-small duo wrap covers blueberry coveralls fit much better maybe gets bigger , wo n't fold rise much , fit better these least favorite covers i honestly regret purchase 
-1	cute idea , however , one rattles n't rattle not rattled much begin by time i would received replacement amazon would grown 's hard say weather not wrist rattles would worked little guy returned refunded 
-1	does n't brush teeth well , 's turned nice toy 10 month old chew ! 
-1	i bought stated bpa free however , i ready wash use , i saw recycle symbol 7 , often used polycarbonate proven leach bpa contents i 'm unsure made , baby products code 5 ( pp ) polypropylene known bpa free i shocked see i wo n't use 
-1	i like spoon lid , n't stick high chair tray i 've tried dry wet i 've cleaned tray suction i also tried bend suction cup make rounded completely useless n't work ! the one star lid spoon fits lid well , i ca n't give stars 
-1	crystal clear sound ? check yes , i hear baby breathing , i also hear lot nothing which i 'm trying avoid in dreams , sound baby 's room would result no sound baby monitor this one n't it as far reviews , lights really n't bothersome , i sensitive light i go bed the static/white noise , however , killer if like sleep sound machine , maybe would love one you hear baby and constant white noise time ! 
-1	this thing crap i tried many times not accurate i put place way says different readings i one work quit one came not working accurately i know use i worked hospital expensive hospital grade artery thermometers one really not accurate rather go old fashioned kind waste money 
-1	since great reviews thermometer pricey i figured 'd great unfortunately i n't liked i could four readings row get vastly different temperatures time getting accurate reading really important i stopped using probably get new thermometer 
-1	i 'm pretty annoyed i n't realize n't working right i 've couple years thankfully , family n't high fevers , really n't needed i recently tried using chart bbt , since reads 1 increments i ca n't even get give reading twice it 's ridiculous do not buy , unless like throwing money away 
-1	okay , i bought thinking 's easy take temperature readings , especially infants my baby sick measured temperature using multiple times course 1-2 days never showed 98-99 degrees ( i e normal body temperature babies ) the following day baby really sick took hospital nearby baby really high fever ( 102 ) even day thermometer showed around 98-99 the doctor nurse said readings things ( scanners ) never accurate they recommended in-ear thermometer ended getting one cvsbraun thermoscan ear thermometer exactemp technology , irt4520ussm it pain take readings using beginning baby much accommodating far 've found reliable reading reviews shows deviation either way , higher lower skip one get one accurate ( aka better reviews ) avoid costs ! ! 
-1	i say , i hate thing it 's unfortunate 's 1 button power / scanning half time i hit button scan temperature , thing turns when i actually get scan , i get 10 different readings time i take so absolutely nothing me based high reviews , i assume i 'm missing something but simply taking temperature n't much room error ! 
-1	i got mail today i put battery , correctly nothing happens no lcd display , light , nada what piece junk ! ( the battery also expiration date december 2011 , , maybe i go buy another 9v battery disappointing ) 
-1	one friend recommended baby registry must-have i use five times row exact spot baby 's ( ) forehead get five different readings our pediatrician actually said not use , found buying if want accurate result truly concerned infant 's temperature rectal temp 
-1	this wo n't work children requires able sit still 3 seconds trust , 3 seconds very long time the child grab device turn head try get away , especially 're bad mood ( often not feeling well ) 'll get error messages the way 'll work someone helping holding kid 's head still even , 'll least 3 different times reading often varies however , device fine adults but , 'll take temp several times average readings vary 
-1	i put thermometer baby registry found reading varies much 3-5 degrees ( taken repeatedly minutes , exact way ) typically close rectal reading ends ( least 2 degrees ) it could i n't know use correctly , husband i read directions tried multiple times - even 's user error , i give 1 start n't difficult have used adults thing happened when compared oral thermometer , seemed far accurate - completely mark 
-1	i not able measure temperature device i tried , spouse , baby each time temperature reading different completely normal temperature three us healthy i ca n't imagine using baby actually sick 
-1	i purchased temporal thermometer present wife , er rn los angeles area we looking week dependable consistent thermometer child i broke days birthday got this when saw device pretty unhappy forced week use devices work , proved trouble larger headache institutional setting worth all temporal thermometers tossed box collected either likely returned credit tossed time essence but i intrigued opened package anyway experimented test-ran thermometer month side side another thermometer , thebraun thermoscan i saw exactly results dealt work here examples inconsistency:1 have temperature fever ? error results repeated inaccurate readings one-point-five sometime two-point-five degrees , huge 2 moisture forehead fever ? error results repeated inaccurate readings 3 head angle forehead shape dictate whether not device even work 4 different degrees register different portions forehead 5 different degrees register darker skin ( ! ) that 's first time one some reviews tell need practice device develop technique , absolutely absurd what ? you 're supposed go around neighborhood interfering parents kids sick work 'technique ' ? gim break , please it 's thermometer , work work consistently unfortunately n't 's supposed therefore exergen take product back drawing board also remove labeling front 's accurate , clearly not i openly suspect lot positive five-star reviews product placed people directly related company ad effort and coming long-time review amazon , kind thing rampant might think do n't buy , getting money back harder taking temp 
-1	we received swing gift the sounds worked beautifully , swing would not swing kinda defeats purpose ! i give one star , get second star customer service great i contacted manufacturer sent replacement they longer swing , sent equivalent one ( actually couple features ) whole transaction hassle free 
-1	we bought i assumed new model= new improved the lowest setting tall 4 month old 's legs needs grow least 3 inches touch base he 75th percentile height weight seat padding cheap feeling quilting softness the head rest part seat supported thin piece low density foam falls backward stitching loose if i seen store i would bought different model i 2 days not write detailed review , wanted warn others high is update : baby 10 months old feet touched bottom lowest setting 2 months this far least stimulating toy screams i put it also makes cracking screech noise jump by far worst design yet exersaucer it cute compliment i owning 6 months 
-1	i would n't buy , bristles gentle end spending twice amount time get different brand ! 
-1	terrible brushes , not expensive broke 2 months usage the brush part broke handle part making basically useless , throw away very disappointed

-1	edit : 6/7/2012changing review 3 1 stars we 've unit 6+ months 1 fall carpeted floor stopped working i stuck buying new system ( parent unit + camera ) , since parent unit ca n't ordered separately all , not good purchase : support multiple cameras web cam mode , calibration thermostat durability stay away ***we put monitor paces weekend since twins , bought additional camera using main screen , images bright adjustment everything seems work fine i strong words caution buying `` skype '' features planning plug windows computer *you need cd drive install drivers there place download drivers you not find product main samsung com website , go samsungsv com something not smell right ? yeah but samsungsv com help either - driver download , nothing *there software comes camera they n't mention software fact nothing , driver allows camera used like web-cam so officially ca n't complain i find odd i expecting least lame viewing interface computer *the image viewing main monitor lcd screen way larger appears view web-cam so aiming camera baby looks great screen carrying around , odds baby screen try viewing webcam this aweful - 2011 n't digital information carried usb cable still digital information ? should n't image information like image size format stay ? ? but *when viewing web-cam , see one camera this annoying when using main viewer , cameras set auto-rotate works great when usb web-cam mode , disabled unkown reason you can change cameras , manually , sit hit button viewer hooked computer , makes sense trying use device skype and reason poorly written software why sell unit support 4 cameras not support 4 cameras internet viewing ? sad , otherwise great looking product , especially multiple kids/cameras *skype - well `` works '' skype - sorta i able create skype account monitor hooked dedicated computer it set automatically connect video calls , but whatever reason camera not automatically come , i get icon without video if i 'm samsung unit computer , call i hit `` video '' button vwalla ! works but , n't work trying use skype so i dispointed internet functionality unit i think description misleading selling skype functionality otherwise , i happy portable monitor unit cameras 
-1	i disappointed monitor if want put parent unit sleep mode turns sound activates sound made it also alarm goes baby cries ( could n't figure actual crying ) it fails mostly choose beeping vibrating , ca n't turn as crying n't enough listen monitor beeping vibrating impossible let little one cry when first got the sensitivity high fan room setting turned little then air conditioning setting every time kicked that fun night so turned sensitivity now i hear crying room monitor goes seriously , n't waste time money product we went motorola happy you turn screen still hear there 's stupid alarm picture quality great ! 
-1	i ordered monitor specifically following advertised features : `` interference free reception , two way talk , remote music activation sleep mode '' these functions somewhat work lots problems low quality let 's take one one:1 ) interference free reception : somewhat true no interference times , although not completely interference free if happen right next lot electronic equipment ( wi-fi router , tv , phones & others ) interference 2 ) two-way talk it works baby hear only if volume camera set maximum close max if volume camera even little lower max level , voice wo n't loud enough ( read : not audible ) baby 's room 3 ) remote music activation - works , however music lullabies useless the speaker quality camera/receiver baby room horrendous very very bad it 's like first computer speakers 20 yrs ago , buzz sound metallic white noise background that not baby-calming music , opposite also , aware 4 lullabies short ( 1 minute ) the unit plays one automatically jumps next , always order you not program play one song only 8 ) finally , sleep mode you set receiver turn video 1,2,5,15 minutes never the screen turns automatically alarm makes turn back n't work properly , makes unreliable monitor here 's biggest problems : the camera/transmitter 2 buttons : volume sensitivity the volume controls music incoming voice feature unless volume set max , music voice comes unit the speakers camera horrible making quality music voice bad the sensitivity button controls sensitive receiver , obviously on highest level sensitivity , parent unit triggers alarm non-stop , even 's absolutely sound room you need lower sensitivity significantly ( half ) parent unit not trigger alarm every second reason however , decrease sensitivity , parent unit n't work reliably sometimes alarm triggered low intensity sounds ( ie , baby cooing ) , 2 3 times need really loud sound trigger alarm because sensitivity level n't work properly , many times 'll end screaming baby monitor actually triggers alarm so useless 
-1	overall i 'm happy product it delivers good video audio it quirks i n't use auto on/off feature based sound calibrte sensitivity camera great want mess around , get perfect , never move bump camera risk screwing also , gui design needs attention it 's not user friendly with said , great picture audio *2013 update*this worked well broke ( main unit , not camera ) luckily amex covered 1yr warranty i used money form amex buy new ( 2013 ) model thinking would work old camera , i 'd two it n't , and 2013 model less features ( temp , example , not old one ever told right temp ) normally i like samsung products seem designed give headache i 'd keep looking 
-1	ok , sent back reasons main one - small buttons hi tech almost like iphone now babies know house mess things fall looks like one devices falls dies the stand small awkward ( not feel secure ) you choose want monitor beep vibrate why cant i video sound baby crying instead ? no i get loud weird beep wake everyone then get sound baby the video descent nothing special really 2 stars fair i got levana instead much better ps i love samsung products research putting market , 
-1	would mice product not battary life it doesnt last even night ! how supposed use ? ? ? ? 
-1	update -- -- -4/30/13 -- -i really like monitor -- -when works we purchased ability remotely operate camera see children 's room this great toddler twins move we able see well infrared daylight but -- -- four months , first parent unit stopped working i believe sound stopped working one , not sure amazon replace quickly without hassle then -- -after three months , replacement monitor got stuck scan 3 , would not recognize three cameras synced amazon wanted contact motorola i , sending second replacement but , warranty good year original date purchase i not confident parent unit last net years i disappointed , i bought monitor toddler twins one way i hoping would last newborn n't need monitored night very expensive short duration use we summer infant slim secure twins , worked well two years it still works , picture not good first , battery n't hold power long at least still able use waiting replacement and use travel original review : we slim secure camera worked little two years we got really like rotate it allows us see whole room two year old twins , easily get trouble ! ! ! ! ! i also like microphone , i say something play music 
-1	**update 8/16/12 : well , finally received new monitor , far functions fine what still grinding gears total lack customer service i contacted vp sales , contacted amazon disgruntled customers asked call personally , i n't received follow-up yet i call `` all talk , no action ! '' i receive call another person motorola , however every time i call leave voicemail , i get return call following friday 2:45pm pst ( 5:45 eastern time - located ) , saying 'll leaving office 15 minutes return monday when i call monday , 's song dance friday what joke i 've shared review fb friends pretty much anyone listen not inadvertently put nightmare never again motorola **update** 8/2/12 : oh holy hell i speak soon in regards return motorola due defective unit , two months later , still not received our replacement ! on june 6 , i sent defective monitor back motorola , including cover letter requested , paid tracking ( requested ) , sent follow-up email ( requested ) nothing after approximately 15 phone calls , 10 emails , everything short threats , i received word today unit shipped i demanded overnight shipping , took another 30 minutes holding phone authorized , still without baby monitor or form apology during two month-long debacle , i dealth variety motorola representatives either rude , lied , simply non-responsive this includes supervisor , charlene , i left several voicemails asking return phone call discuss total lack customer service received , i yet get response needless say , beyond angry disappointed never ever ever purchase another motorola product due ridiculous time taken get new baby monitor , purchasedsummer infant best view handheld color video monitor , sliver/whitesine , um , baby need monitor , loved do n't waste money motorola monitor ; not ( works ) n't great , ever issue , disgusted lack service , likely find pissed buying another brand anyways this monitor bells whistles ( except vox ) , exactly husband i ( anxious new parents ) needed moved daughter room crib the screen size excellent , picture quality superb , i find menu easy navigate even dark 4am the problem camera ( aka baby unit ) stopped working nowhere couple uses ! i tried `` pair '' , users manual suggests parent unit loses connectivity baby unit , failed pair i called motorola , unlike reviewers , fantastic customer service i n't receipt monitor gift , however authorized return replacement anyways i update review return process completed so long new monitor works continues , i would recommend monitor 
-1	after wonderful reviews monitor i really looking forward using what disappointment i 'm going return ; simply not meet family needs , 's : cons : - having one parent monitor extremely limiting so many nights i 'll upstairs office husband downstairs watching tv , i 'll treadmill basement , one us able hear see kids - the up/down range motion somewhat limited my old monitor not circular range motion , good terms up/ which means , i keep monitor shelf top piece furniture far away 2 5 yr old 's curious hands this monitor goes far , means , i ca n't place high , n't show full bed crib this , limiting in order see son 's toddler bed , i place camera across room relative waist-level , means day reaches , sometimes 'll get night see green light very frustrating - the biggest downside monitor system battery life as i mentioned , one parent unit , goes dead , 're completely without monitor , 's happens every night ! we charge battery day ( 7am 9pm ) , yet , inevitably , runs juice sometime middle night 're sleeping morning 's totally dead turned , may well not monitor what 's point monitor ca n't trust stay charged 8 hours ? pros : to fair , great qualities product , i give credit : - the quality video excellent , day ( color ) night ( infrared/ black white ) i clearly see everything view - the lateral range motion remote capabilities fantastic i literally see around room ( almost complete 360 ) , even son gets bed , i see 's i love feature - the set-up use easy it 's intuitive easy figure out all , i may learned live one parent unit , battery life not something compromise we really need monitor reliable count last night 
-1	this unit pretty good toggle power switch broke it fairly intuitive use , picture decent ( lot people complained video , i thought good enough ) , battery life , even new , n't remotely advertised when i purchased , promised eight hours battery beeping us four a little year bought , toggle power switch broke motorola offers support one year for monitor expensive break year normal use ridiculous , motorola clearly n't stand behind products ( n't get started razr ) pathetic at point , still use , least already broke , stay plugged , battery dies powers , wo n't able turn again would not recommend 
-1	what i like : - easy set up- very clear image , day night- very clear sound , sometimes magnifies baby 's crying much even lowest volume setting- love angels camera coverswhat i n't like : - after several months , microphone stopped working consistently we blow , twist , turn camera angel randomly audio work it either wiring issue got dusty not sure but bad , nights past several months , baby crying nursery n't hear now , i always test audio i go bed every night sure - the music comes camera sounds bad never use it - it drops reception sometimes even close range 
-1	we used two summer infant monitors motorola we feel strongly summer infant far better this one looks high tech option camera moves intercom feature however , lacks features overall quality makes features seem like small potatoes first , video feed choppy best if wave hand front monitor see freeze every two seconds that 's video feed always i n't like with summer infant i could literally watch daughter 's chest rise fall smooth , real time , continuous video this not true motorola beyond , monitor buttons awful not designed use dark on summer infant one , screen goes black large button top monitor push picture returns think snooze button alarm clock big -- easy find hit dark the motoroloa button tiny button second bottom right yeah -- not helpful beyond , darn thing beeps battery getting low obviously motorola engineers not consider fact several months longer many babies sleep parents ' room baby fussing making noise 's nice look monitor instead getting going stand crib , possibly waking baby creaky floor board rustling around the beeping wakes baby ! it also beeps randomly reason i refer manual figure it green light flashes next light beeping going the screen super bright bad baby room since light illuminats room also shocks eyes first turn last not least , interferes wifi baby monitor sits next it 's not smart design overall i shoud heeded reviews lack thought engineers put design i wish opened monitor used nights second daughter arrived we would returned within allowable time bought another summer infant one we drawn moving camera two way talk features i 'd gladly give monitor intuitive works better 
-1	raging piece junk we used year battery would n't charge without video screen battery never really held charge long display unit died year replaced summer infant unit motorola put name nicer piece hardware biggest positive pan/tilt silent otherwise , resolution n't great compared summer unit , 's always night ( black white ) mode , web cam output , short battery life , break if without noise level indicator , i 'd go webcam ( foscam ) /smartphone solution otherwise , i 'd suggest options 
-1	i wanted love monitor i researched heck buying i actually bought second camera go kids different rooms the pros : works great day , really simple set link second camera , sound really good it 's easy adjust volume screen quite large compared last video monitor the buttons simple i got hang right box i 'd give five stars kids slept well lit rooms but 's night vision the first monitor 's night vision crapped day six the picture totally grainy i could n't even make son 's face i sent back , got new one , cameras slowly exact thing i 've using new unit three weeks clearly fundamental problem night vision since happened twice month motorola replace ( five phone calls ) , replaced equally defective unit considering thing cost $ 350 extra camera , i 'm extremely disappointed major bummer 
-1	update : almost 2 years monitor broken first picture faded , motorola replaced unit , the new unit 's battery basically died 6 months , keep plugged not huge deal , one would think would last longer year but on/off button broken product warranty it good lasted , n't last we live small apartment , i ca n't comment range , monitor works perfectly the picture clear -- yes i see baby breathing i stare long enough ( yes , i stare long enough ! ) and 's static pricey , worth , i think update : monitor less year picture started degrade to motorola 's credit , sent us replacement right away we turn screen go bed i 'm sure keeping many hours killed but battery new unit lasts 30 minutes 
-1	update : audio n't work power plus works half time motorola 's customer service never helpful do favor buy different monitor for first ~2 years monitor , i thought great video quality great daylight , decent enough night audio sensitive always leave lowest setting pan/tilt wonderful battery life n't great adequate since plug overnight anyway about two years problem audio parent unit it quiet turn max setting even mostly got white noise but , strangely , short time issue resolved perhaps 's loose soldering job somewhere there more troubling though 's gone almost 2 5yrs home power plug wo n't stay firmly enough charge without fiddling around if i push hard lay cord night table `` '' 's problem but monitor accidentally moved inch , blue light goes runs battery that would n't bad except battery inadequate whole night , i 'm awoken loud beeping 3am now 're looking two-camera system i 'm strongly debating whether stick motorola start new one entirely 
-1	this stupid ( not inexpensive ) monitor stopped working couple weeks use we began using regularly infant moved room blue , go bed , sound stops working now thanks motorola working monitor overnight 
-1	overall camera great got was impressed range , sound , picture about 8 months first one night vision stopped working got lucky i bought amazon one year return explained happened great customer service exchanged now time 5 months night vision went it brand new unit so not one time issue if n't care night vision i would recommend camera if one reason purchasing unit i would go another model 
-1	i owned two sets product faced many issues , many reported custumers so advise : not buy product my first set lasted 3,5 months , second 5 months since i n't live us , 's warranty i bought summer infant digital touch , let 's hope lasts longer issues i encountered : - sound stopped working - first & second set- night vision stopped working - first set- power button broke - second set- low battery warning n't work - second setoriginal review : mine stopped working 3,5 months use the sound went , 's important feature ! since support country , bought new onewe one working monitor 2 working cameras until camera first unit ( one whose monitor broke ) also died : infrared stopped working it still used sound purposes , image dark i normally leave volume one two bars maximum , otherwise hear pin drop ! the range also bit issue my house quite big , i get signal many rooms i n't know tough monitor available would n't problem if possible connect wifi pros : - image quality- volume control- possibility adding cameras- scan pancons : - durability- battery life- range 
-1	i gifted friend it worked well 1 day , completely stopped working they since bought simple one ( unknown brand ) working fine amazon amazing gave refund even though friends thrown away packaging i returned sandwich / freezer bag 
-1	first one n't last full year , monitor stopped working unless plugged ( replaced batteries still would n't work ) so continued use monitor stopped working together we replaced completely died second one came straight manufacture monitor n't work all only comes one camera for price , least come 2 cameras one monitor

-1	after 6 months working pretty well monitor die i took different stores try fix nobody could anything i wasted almost $ 200 motorola i n't recommend it cheaper much better buy camera system i see daughter cellphone every i go , i see day night listen perfectly clear even breathing do n't waste money , go something good 
-1	the picture monitor great i like rotation feature the major problem i found monitor not hold charge you basically need keep plugged work it would go fully charged beeping obnoxiously 15-20 minutes usage ( video screen off ) would die there better video monitors , even picture not great , want thing work n't bother one 
-1	i received monitor shower gift registry it simply n't work the image stalls not real time the sound also delay i 'll hear baby cry get monitor pick 30/45 seconds later the range also really short not get signal one end home i also received second camera also gift figured might make difference no ! i 've called customer service told i n't receipt ( gift ) could n't anything even purchased registry very disappointed , could used several cases diapers instead !

-1	having tried several brands breastmilk storage bags last 9 months breastfeeding daughter , i disappointed first years brand i purchased economical brands , medela lansinoh however , i learned old adage applies - really get pay the first years bags consistently sprung leaks bottom milk defrosted this led significant number ounces painstakingly-gathered pumped milk literally thrown away leaked refrigerator additionally , reviews noted , bag size much smaller brands ( particularly compared lansinoh ) , means hold much less milk per bag since not freeze flat like lansinoh bags , also means precious freezer space taken storing brand the reason i given bags two stars instead one not every bag i purchased leaked however , ratio leaking bags non-leaking bags unacceptable merit higher review , especially considering i leaks brands bags i purchased much larger quantities ( e g , medela lansinoh ) i purchased one box one box first years storage bags reason , i would not recommend anyone else unless tolerance playing russian roulette regarding whether not bags leak waste milk

-1	totally waste money i purchased weeks baby born i washed packed use hospital stay he never used ! ! ! they made cheap cotton , n't like elastic band wrist area it imposible put baby my husband needed go target get new ones since son born sharp nails save money ! 
-1	i wanted like , total disappointment they fell daughter 's hands immediately , wrist bands n't really seem elastic properties i thought maybe got little bigger 'd work , 's 2 months old ( not small ) still useless we found gerber ones elastic best far 
-1	those mittens not elastic , hassle put newborn 's hands wo n't expend you try hard put baby 's hand , makes difficult painful fingers trying make fit 
-1	newborns need mittens huge they 're sized 2 3 month olds ! we use socks hands hospital i 'd recommend onesies fold hands weather permits long sleeves 
-1	while pattern cute , mat made thin plastic -- think disposable , emergency rain coats keep back car given thin plastic , i would say mat not terribly durable i really n't even use mat son 's chair , instead , sometimes use like toy parachute -- husband i flap son crawls 
-1	do not buy cup holder i read reviews bought anyway i figured uppababy made specifically strollers thought bad could ? it 's awful it attaches outside stroller hits/bumps everything slightest bump knock whole thing when i fold stroller falls often for price charge would think would make better quality cup holder buy britax stroller organizer instead you not regret 
-1	i love uppababy i disappointed cup holder ( well previous model bad looks ) i not believe i remove cup holder stroller every time i need collapse it inconvenient i ended getting diono cupholder vista 
-1	there lot great things cup holder it 's easy attach , swivels , stay stroller collapsed ( kind ) , importantly hold hot drink unfortunately , outweighed crux design : cup holder sticks stroller you smash doorway catch display turn aisle grocery store you certainly learn give stroller wider berth- n't defeat point one narrowest full size strollers ( case cruz ) ? also , personally i prefer drink close hands if extend handlebar , cup holder ( understandably ) n't follow feel pretty far away- especially 're taller if okay , means go it- rest cup holder fine uppababy makes incredibly thoughtful , quality products- got door i 'm not sure literally figuratively ! i hope ub creates better alternative hot drinks future 
-1	annoying put outside hit doors time course broke 
-1	this good lasted , unfortunately catches everything result broke clip both sides uppa baby vista sad i calling uppa baby see fix i n't solution i feel like cup holder almost necessary stroller use time 
-1	we bought ub cruz stroller ( like lot ) , seems like uppababy never actually tested organizer stroller with seat forward facing ( common direction , one allows fold stroller ) , organizer makes harder impossible change seat angle upright reclining the way seat move past organizer organizer top frame handle extended longest position the organizer held velcro , needs reattached every days velcro loosens it also tends slide frame the entire organizer much larger heavier needs limited function gives -- cupholder couple small pockets another reviewer said uppababy told would pass along negative feedback design team they n't even bother i wrote 
-1	i love idea parent organizer - place put water bottle , cell phone , keys , etc however , uppababy cruz stroller forward facing position , not recline seat parent organizer strapped ! it gets way seat not recline what use organizer i unstrap order recline seat ? i definitely returning item amazon since pretty much useless do n't waste time money one 
-1	i 'm very disappointed britax car seat travel bag it not come instructions utlize my b-safe seat 's manual also not explain use optional bag i discovered thru trial error ( no thanks britax ) , need place seat upside bag also , seat base level ( angle ) tilted way forward if incorrectly place seat base bag right side , 'll seat base 's sharp edge painfully digging back , 'll applying excessive stress bag zippers why instructions ? how much would piece paper cost ? the bag should internal reinforcement grab handle stretching full width top bag but n't thus pulling bag wheels picking bag awkward clumsy affair the wheels not feature pull cover , use backpack mode thus , back pants become horribly dirty wheels carry backpack the shoulder straps minimal padding very uncomfortable the enclosure owner 's id card ( located top bag ) provision `` retaining '' white paper card if bag placed side , card falls ( rather purpose defeating design flaw ) i 'm shocked year 2012 , britax not design zipper heads accomodate travel lock any time would check bag rather carry-on , attaching ( tsa-approved ) travel lock must nowadays in fact , traveling abroad , many airlines require sign disclaimer checked bags n't locks what could great car seat travel bag full short sighted design flaws i 'm extremely unhappy britax 's execution update : one week receiving bag , i put test carrying new b-agile stroller i traveled united , 4 aircraft now , 2 puncture holes main body bag and , reinforced material bottom 2 areas rubbed verge puncturing in day age , nylon luggage materials highly resistant abrasion punctures however , britax not use materials construction bag for premium price , certainly i 'm extremely disappointed 
-1	we britax convertible car seat huge fit perfectly it 's simply bag makes easy transport car seat keep clean the back pack straps cool feature liked wheels , however ; returning when first used , zipper broke teeth pulled part added stress flying infant first time we 're going try search another brand car seat may fit if ca n't find one , 'll use big plastic bags airline provide put 
-1	these spoons pain , especially really thin foods 4 months+ even plan waiting 6 months , many stage 1 foods foods containing prunes may need feed bit older still thinner variety these spoons also basically impossible grab feed mood , always ended disaster we preferred take toss spoons , cheaper better shape 
-1	these spoons suck the cheap walmart spoons even better food n't stay spoon they n't soft like i thought hate 
-1	personally i havent used cant speak work wanted add review let know priced much less marshalls tj max same dr brown feeding bowls but none microwave safe beware 
-1	bought freeze store homemade baby food needed bigger size ice cube tray size good , jars lame lids not stay , n't create good seal , frozen food came freezer burn smell also , frozen food not come easily ca n't tell many fingernails 've broken trying pop cube frozen peas silicon retains smells even portions placed fridge night come smelling funny successful usage use freeze large batch overnight , transfer frozen cubes ziplock bag within day get freezer burn smell get food let thaw minutes really release sides jars whatever 're looking , keep looking 
-1	when i read reviews i saw lot bad lot great comments it seemed like read followed directions would work great no way ! if tighten enough n't leak baby ca n't get anything spout if loosen like directions say leaks everything ! i 'm returning asap the good thing i say fit parts dr browns bottles , n't buy everything 
-1	usually like life factory company products not like sippy cup top really hard suck water 3yr old ca n't , 10 month old ca n't ca n't either also emailed company didnt help problem either 
-1	we love lifefactory bottles ! our daughter loves much hard wean away bought super expensive caps convert sippy cups she used types sippy cups transition not problem caps almost useless both caps came hard plastic caps silicon insert the instructions say loosen cap bottle adjust flow the issue caps tight possible , flow zero we tried hard could suck water bottle caps fully tightened could not get drop neither could daughter we loosened bit could get water bottle leaks place beneath edges collar cap tilted slightly when take gasket , flow good n't much sippy cup on positive side , caps come bottles fit perfectly we n't issue breaking n't much use either on whole really disappointed caps we continue impressed bottles would n't trade anything so really assumed lifefactory would come good product caps n't least not purposes 
-1	my toddler active able open close objects easily she comfortable sippy cups wife insisted using glass purchased whole set life factory bottles dissapointed the concept tightening loosening cap flow not work us , daughter would unscrew open spill i not tighten way causing flow non-existent 
-1	i invested lifefactory bottles ( large small ) well tops [ first kid , i say ] these not work well sippy cup they leak spill little guy not like hard spout i ended taking advice mothers ( wisdom daycare workers ) went nuk sippy do n't bother ; idea awesome , product execution not 
-1	with silicone part sippy cap , 14 month old not get liquid without , cap spills actually shoots liquid turned sideways kid laying down i really wanted awesome use bottles , less awesome also , n't come colors bottles come ? ! ? 
-1	my 11 month daughter 3 minutes manages unscrew the valve tight , i often remove gets enough water , course means soaked even valve , lifefactory baby bottles leak not upright i n't impressed lifefactory baby bottle nipple tops either 
-1	after originally posting review 1 star , i upgrading caps 2 stars based fact fit regular bottles when i bought valves prevented liquid getting manufacturer suggested i squeeze valve 's spout using hey presto , worked ! there mention website little info sheet packet moreover , washing , valves get stuck often i resorted squeezing spout every time i put this not bad comparison fact lids baby n't finish bottle , remove cap ( messy impossible squirmy baby arms ) stick something else watertight cap ! this caps leak even screwed tight 
-1	i say upfront picture monitor fine money spent monitor it n't pan zoom i knew going buying my problems thus far:1 ) vox auto mute n't really work it comes `` sound '' room n't changed we run low-decibel white noise monitors not pick this monitor picks , causing monitor turn ( wake ! ) nothing happening room 2 ) wifi interference this major problem my phone not connect wifi monitor causes computer drop wifi signal it hogs 2 4 ghz bandwidth we 've resort putting audio monitor room `` daytime '' actually use electronics go bed ( know , time time since baby ) we turn monitor get bed need wifi it 's problem i 'm considering donating thing goodwill i would not purchase item i would not recommend friend 
-1	i bought back august n't need really use daughter moved room december last week sound gave slowly monitor getting worse i bought stripped version ones market it feels cheap looks cheap i going try customer service see helpful replacing/refunding money there year warrenty let 's see really covers i 'll update review service least helpful update : never heard anyone was n't able get replaced refund bought motorola one form babies r us i 'm happy it like $ 200 worth extra $ $ it stays charged ( one never did ) great sound quality ( without hearing everything ) i sorry i bought infant optics first lesson learned n't go cheap 
-1	my sister purchased baby monitor us 9 months ago i picked one price i really n't care product i n't use much i thought i would pros+ the black & white visual clear on + light weight+ not expensivecons- there one power cord so need charge monitor not use time camera needs power some reviews mentioned one battery source i not seen another one - i hardest time getting camera come i not able figure i wrong i gadget person device not friend 
-1	i assume everyone else 's reviews i got lemon , sound night vision not work monitor i called infant optics ' customer support , accommodating willing process return - could not generate free shipping return label like amazon could i returned i considered reordering product , instead going motorola mbp33 wireless video baby monitor seems consistently high ratings 
-1	lightweight cheaply made granted video n't bad , however audio low defeats point monitor i 've since returned i bought graco true focus digital video monitor instead 's not perfect definitely better 
-1	so many great reviews i really expecting love monitor however i n't my son roller- never stayed frame i tried putting camera room ; wall , table facing crib , attached crib , nothing worked ! turned everytime rolled shook crib bit camera would tilt thus rendering useless 
-1	i shocked many good reviews i even tried go good reviews make sure i 'm not missing something terms adjustments , not appear case we summer baby montior , infinitely better , truly poor product versus competitors here issues:1 ) there ring red lights around camera we camera installed crib , meant son kept staring it 2 ) the video quality night poor not deal killer , compared summer monitor , definitely unacceptable 3 ) the sound terrible if sound turned 3 bars , buzz starts going , i 'd okay 's constant buzz like white noisy , 's sporatic , making impossible us sleep there 's humidifier baby 's room , maybe 's causing monitor go nuts , whatever , 's annoying 4 ) the deal killer : annoy sound problems , i still lazy return product however , week ago , son started coughing storm middle night but the monitor had gone into night mode and did n't wake up ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we heard cough walls by time , coughed long chocking throwning crib we immediately took emergency room this piece of junk is going back to amazon do not buy ! 
-1	unfortunately monitor n't come our baby cried luckily discovered i happened turn screen baby started crying not safe n't work expected 
-1	i purchased monitor cheap yet great reviews however , i believe reviews paid associates people the quality picture not great it 's okay it 's kind clumpy times it 's simple monitor lets see hear baby i monitor month exactly surprise ( speaking sarcastically ) inferred stopped working one night ! i pissed i need monitor baby since moves around much night tends wake frequently not inferred stop working , starting two weeks monitor kept showing white/colored noise ( like turning tv channel n't , white static shows ) i upset i returning that day i ordered foscam baby monitor much $ 19 dollars ! it pans tilts , zooms , two way communication , room temperature ( alarm goes gets hot cold room ; off/on option ) , baby feeding reminder ( off/on option ) , vox sensitivity levels , i mention screen 3 5 inch ! i love new monitor , infant optics well , never again i understand i randomly received one issues , i n't expect technology point , both camera monitor issues that 's i giving two starts inferred stopped working radio still worked least i still able hear baby cry 
-1	1 ) instructions came product must written 9 year old chinese foreign exchange student2 ) syncing cameras monitor pita3 ) when working great picture 
-1	i returning product , i get i returning i want clear misconceptions it clear many users not read directions there three ways use monitor 1 with video sound times ( yes , it drain battery quickly ) 2 with video turning 3 minutes sound 60 db ( therefore , conserving battery not continually showing video ) *it turn back senses loud sounds ( baby crying , yelling ) 3 with video and sound - turning loud sounds heard ( this monitors call & # 34 ; sleep mode & # 34 ; parents n't hearing baby moving around crib sounds need heard night ) if 're problems sound , not video , cutting read the directions now why i returning ? 1 there constant & # 34 ; hum & # 34 ; & # 34 ; crackling & # 34 ; sound coming parent unit it n't matter i turned wifi it continued happen i know lot users complained messed wifi well i n't know mine not i even followed directions manual fix problem i tell continued happen despite router turned and n't matter close far away i camera parent unit , n't reception problem either 2 the video quality n't good i expected there lot & # 34 ; noise & # 34 ; you photographer people understand 3 even highest volume setting - hard hear daughter the high setting monitor compared low-medium volume setting old monitor 4 the manual states point antennae monitor higher floor that way 's always pointed toward floors likely parent unit well ca n't turn camera the antennae blocks it 5 it 's light weight cheap feeling i feeling toddler accidentally got hold 'd toast my monitor parent unit abused toddler 's still going fine i really wanted love monitor you get pay i guess i 'm bummed 
-1	i 'm sure great baby monitor would n't turn us router interfered `` out signal coverage '' saw sell since outside return range before buy , confirm router not performing ghz level customer service called us back within 24 hours helpful letting us know problem though 
-1	we using monitor 6 months i need buy new one i n't like :1 you ca n't turn screen even dimmest like flashlight lights whole bedroom i taped paper screen make dimmer 's still bright 2 if turn monitor turn camera beeps really loudly thus risking waking baby 3 some times beeps reason , really loudly in middle night almost causing heart attack 4 i ca n't mount base/ camera anything sits stool next crib farther away i ca n't hear baby 5 i keep volume highest , thats not even loud enough middle night , sometimes i n't hear baby thing right next me 6 sometimes n't pick sound right away baby already screaming i recommend spending bit money getting better one 
-1	pros : good sound video quality cons : interferes wifi , freaks makes obnoxious sound waking us lost signal time we live condo monitor never 30 ft camera interferes cell phone wifi use android phone , not husband 's iphone wierd monitor antenna easily broke not solidly built 
-1	there 's lag video , camera unit incredibly annoying 's notification beeping it n't hold charge worth crap loses signal time less 1700 sq ft house i would n't purchase 
-1	initial 2 weeks- this second monitor i buying baby i love one i used 2 weeks , got stuck take battery turn off but otherwise i happy quality pictures - even low light picture pretty clear updated 2 weeks - monitor gets stuck frequently it showed picture baby sleeping even hours woke i tried turn monitor , i couldnt finally remove battery happened couple times already removing stars original rating 
-1	meh the video feed pretty clear , love night vision but several issues : 1 where supposed attach thing get good angle ? ! ? the weird base camera comes not helpful you not sit flat surface not attach wall get good view just awkward 2 the camera plugged , means cord , means close crib i hide cord away so , i put ? 3 the camera turned left right , not so , i ca n't even attach wall ! 4 the monitor 's battery not last long camera , i basically need keep constantly plugged 5 the camera picks louder noises , even positioned close , sometimes i ca n't tell 's awake unless moving 6 my camera looks slightly different one pictured they need update picture reflect crappy base comes ! so right i camera perched top stuffed animal hanging clothes shelf , someone bumps , angle usually not realize 's asleep i room , course i really surprised one top selling monitors ! 
-1	my husband i trouble getting monitor work finally synced camera monitor would accidentally push one side buttons would power unit then 'd reprogram it annoying after using monitor times completely stopped working we going try another brand 
-1	we bought video monitor back i summer infant touch video monitor replaced ( n't buy one either ) this good back monitor traveling opinion but main monitor , stinks it impossible get camera angled correctly the picture grainy the sound goes and , turn monitor beeps really loudly so , trying make sure camera angled correctly turning monitor ( nursery ) , beeps really loudly wake kid it also beeps loses signal then ironically , battery dying monitor , makes noise , power light starts blink 90 % time i n't notice i look monitor 's turned b/c battery dead now , i probably spoiled summer infant touch great camera control remotely ( monitor awful b/c n't work long ) , i still think not good monitor primary monitor 
-1	we owned two $ 200 summer video monitors son 's almost 4 year old life sound started going 2nd monitors first , i thought surely 's competing product 's priced better so i bought one based mostly positive reviews meh people clearly impressed one n't ever owned i would n't use infant optics monitor infant the video quality inferior you would not able see details chest going want check baby 's breathing night , either general nightly paranoia new parents baby cold child asthma , whatever on summer monitor see the infant optics picture really digitalized looking , not finely detailed it 's ok 4 yo i need see 's bed fall sometimes i keep sound constantly i n't want issues not hearing call the camera 's placed baby 's room - nobody mentioned i ca n't fathom - lit bright like freaking ufo it 's crazy it lights room enough almost serve night light there several bright bright red lights around eye camera blue green light top bounces ceiling illuminating room ( i covered top light helped ; summer monitor one bright green light i always covered one ) to people new babies , parents child really struggles fall asleep , child may lay stare red lights , not fall asleep and 's way could something like summer monitor , place camera inside crib foot away swaddled newborn could see close could monitor breathing night easily sight sound if put camera inside crib baby would not sleep wink night long i 'm really glad i saved old faulty summer monitor i n't huge amount confidence one last long , based flimsy feels but 's impression not actual experience reliability will check later regard still , another reviewer said wished 'd sprung summer monitor 's i feel comparing two products update : i returning monitor i 'm done i already not happy quality sound last night i suspected would happen happen -- son woke called i n't hear first sound quiet , muffled distorted he 's saying `` mom '' i could hear weird sound reminded recordings whales singing underwater it 's ridiculous in fact i think amazon investigate legitimacy 5-star reviews product i ca n't imagine parent really finds sound quality acceptable 
-1	you hardly hear kids thing if light sleeper n't media might work you- nice price point but 're heavy sleeper keep tv music kids nap , n't bother 
-1	we 've monitor less 1 month , battery n't last longer 2-3 hours fully charged there n't button turn video , would probably help remedy battery issue extent additionally , fact screen stays time really annoying want room case , i n't know , baby cries middle night lights entire room ! if try cover , sound gets muffled we 're sending monitor back-bottom line , i would not recommend it i gave 2 stars couple qualities i liked , i share 1 ) it white noise filter , means 10 seconds repetitive noise ( fan , noise machine , heater , etc ) sound shut hears noise baby 2 ) the parent unit capacity switch 4 cameras , though i notice additional cameras almost much entire monitor set 3 ) both camera parent unit compact 
-1	so i done alot research baby monitors struggling buy pretty spendy motorola monitor b/c mixed reviews well i decided look elsewhere ran across monitor it good reveiws $ 100 well i looked little harder cause monitor sucks ! i thing less week already crapped first made weird noise , weird fuzzy bar bottom , one day whole picture blurry later day picture first i known better get brand i never heard second $ 100 pretty spendy plastic-ey no really like mcdonalds toy the called `` stand '' even cheaper plastic , i super careful set b/c felt like going snap and gives appearance option button front monitor says infant optics ? its like put thinking going give monitor options decided lazy left appearance like fool buyers my husband i fidgeted thinking button i read instructions made sure everything wireless router date would interference something i noticed i took parent unit downstairs would weak signal really ? how many people two story houses didnt think work kink ? i dont like isnt zoom temperature guage , $ 100 think could added little anyway , thing piece crap ! do n't waste time ! 
-1	we older summer infant monitor really loved , recently night vision stopped working 's kind annoying so , i read bunch reviews one decided replace summer infant i n't really impressed the sound tinny unit felt lightweight , bordering cheaply made then realized frequency hopping interfering wireless router signal we could n't use ipad , laptop phones around stay connected internet it annoying we finally decided working night vision n't worth hassle worth another $ 99 returned 
-1	we not even thinking getting video monitor second baby simple audio monitor first price but found one it got pretty good reviews little bit money decent audio monitors we using couple weeks not impressed it nice able see almost 2 year old sleeping ( not sleeping ) crib it decent night vision set still see dark however , parent unit not keep charge long ! we keep charged day except nap , maybe 3 hours it n't even usually last whole time the complaint interferes internet connection randomly my hubby started complaining part week ago i thought crazy started happening last couple days overall , i probably would n't buy , keep 's much pain send back point update : 12/28/12this definitely not worth money i paid , i already wishing i spent little money first place get nicer monitor the antenna 's cheap plastic broken monitor useless it n't signal i ordered much nicer motorola monitor replace i would definitely not recommend buying , plenty research spend extra money ! 
-1	we bought monitor use son 's room , looking something good , also something would n't break bank after reading many positive reviews i excited get product home initially i thought going good , started noticing things n't like 1 cheap flimsy plastic- cheap fact camera seems like tip lightest touch2 the camera wo n't tilt , side side , sucked hard time getting right angle3 the electrical cords short , inconvenient battery life unit short , i needed keep plugged night , fine except closest outlet caused cord stretch , easy trip the cords could n't 3-4 feet long 4 battery life monitor short , constantly charging thing 5 lastly , i found constant volume irritatingso yes , easy set , cheap , crap we returned bought motorola one , far superior one we actually got bj 's wholesale club , paid $ 130 , like $ 180 amazon 
-1	this monitor n't work us since use wi-fi if do'nt use wi-fi work fine we use netflix computers every time 's used monitor n't work it often says 's range 're bathroom weird since apt 1100 sq ft fine also unless blinds way monitor always black white even 's middle day room needs bright color i liked monitor since scrambled n't worry others watching us monitor n't work well wi-fi too bad good price oh made light weight plastic 
-1	i bought unit high hopes i lot looking research thought reasonable choice since i unit gone three power supplies the company send new supply located california i east coast , takes days get somebody company talk , couple days ship item , week traveling mail so almost two weeks stuck without unit not able use ! this happened three times i thought i smart actually purchased back power supply next time well next time happened last night , i plugged back supply n't work so i 'm thinking maybe time 's unit stopped working unless i got bad power supply i ordered back i guess i checked not assumed anything so i 'm waiting call back start entire process meantime i n't working monitor daughter i would look another company i know soon i afford buy another one i moving one ones

-1	we followed instruction charging hand held pretty much stay charger kinda defeats purpose us getting it the camera great the nighttime vision wonderful handheld awful at least we would return little one n't arrive month return option expired january 
-1	i lost zoli container decided purchase one instead replacing zoli if 're using separate pieces , really fill cause curved bottoms tops , put , unfortunately join together , lose lot space , i fit maybe 3 fig newtons container , cookies another , 's waste so i give another mother baby use formula smaller snacks i feel not designed well if 're looking something hold snacks toddler , i highly recommend zoli sumo snack stack 
-1	these worked great original dr brown bottles , not work well new wider dr brown bottle caps if baby daycare , label bottle cap bottle i stop using new dr brown bottles however , work fine old bottles i started using erasable/rewritable lables date , along permanent self-laminating labels name type milk used that combination seems work best 
-1	this made china unlike dr brown products i purchased i love dr browns , i not ordering anything else the product page amazon list things made 
-1	car seat difficult install rear-facing seat instructions not clear , unable get tilt right unfortunately , not work mazda cx-5 ( crossover vehicle ) could not tilt enough without front seats getting way work , 'd move driver passenger seats forward decided go infant carseat instead

-1	money wasted i bought 4 the pink one hard find 's stuck green ones 
-1	there reasons i hate training pants 1 ) the `` pocket '' n't sewn wide ( actually tapered -- pocket gets skinnier skinnier goes ) 's hard stuff anything , really i 've fold everything half , adds lot bulk my son hates wearing these 2 ) the design really weird when get poor kid , look fine front back looks ridiculous ! my son puffier butt cloth diapers ! ! weird design i really n't like it 3 ) leaks always i know 's not fit issue i 've stuffed every type material we always leaks and put son nap time -- after got potty beforehand completely useless 4 ) holy hannah , they stink ! ! i think 's material inner lining made oh goodness , retain smells ! ! none cloth diapers training pants stink washed i wash rest - different treatment - come smelling like washed ! they look clean smell awful bottom line - waste money hard stuff ( i bought first place - i could stuff nap time ) , weird puffy butt design , leaks , stinky bad investment glad i bought one test ! 
-1	i 2t 14 month , 19 pound daughter they fit fine room grow , though saggy bottom my biggest issue two four snaps n't fit opposites , n't stay together these look pretty ridiculous half buttoned crooked , besides fact n't stay on i also found not water-proof today , one pee , i 'm sure n't big since n't drink hours , leaking i n't necessarily need water-proof , i get cheaper , non-water-proof underpants instead buying expensive ones leak 
-1	this diaper leaks every time i put daughter ! the inside soft , snap umbilical cord stump ( great ) n't hold up my girl tiny petite one month old , diaper lose around legs also bulky compared diapers i 
-1	section would n't hold 3 tablespoon oatmeal veggie mix , / not practical buywe use teach kid operate spoon plate ( little food ) , not actual feeding 
-1	i excited find pail specifically cloth diapers i eagerly awaited 's arrival soon i opened box heart sunk i disappointed wanted return the bin small i felt not worth price however , realizing $ 12 shipping cost would come pocket , well cost send back , felt like i stuck rock hard place-either pay $ 25 return $ 38 bucket keep , 's sitting 's box corner nursery i looked cloth diaper pails everythwere ( online , ) could n't find another larger sepcifically cloth diapers i would recommend someone get simple plastic bin stick air fresheners/filters onto inside lid , would save significant $ $ i wish i thought instead currently , i nice big one gal owns diaper service use ( i n't realize providing pail ordered one ) i asked got much costs found comes canada get one $ 40 i 'm not sure brand orders i find i 'll add review 
-1	very cool idea , ca n't use n't fit chairs correctly the backs chairs high , 's not enough material seat part reach seat chair -- keeps baby pulled 's gap bottom chair i 've used far may try using go see fits chairs restaurants relatives houses better it 's pretty useless far 
-1	i 've using arm hammer discs diaper pal past 10 months thought worked pretty decent i saw positive reviews decided try i see absolutely difference quite pricey very disappointed stinky diaper pail 
-1	i guess supposed work fine , i live florida baby would sweat much ! i not even sure i could use winter overall i not like , big , hot material 
-1	this cradler pushes sons head forward rather supporting falls asleep i bought thinking would place lay head falls asleep car hates banana shape actually forces head forward , 
-1	not looking the product sturdy not keep infants head place 
-1	this way big infants head car seat when velcro wide enough fit head , big car seat i may able use one piece prop head , i really hoping something could seat time ready whenever falls asleep car i washed i realized n't going work , i ca n't return 
-1	i thought would the solution kids traveling long distances sleep comfortably unfortunately , n't like head stuck two big bananas maybe older kids , i n't know 
-1	we hopeful got would substitute way car rides relax baby it not a things first , fabric not i expecting feels cheap reason compared fisher price things gotten second , motion not soothe daughter this subjective - - realize children different , also future may soothe even though not yet month plus it third , not hold baby like car seat fabric quality seat , not snuggly enough makes sense i feel like daughter sleeps well chicco car seat snuggled cozy this not effect overall , save $ - swing bouncy worked much better 
-1	perhaps i high expectations , product real disappointment one major pro , n't tip 
-1	kids hate after one use wanted bottle and leaks every angle hard put together hard suck leaks 
-1	i hoped use potty-trained toddler nap case made tinkles sleeping ; unfortunately , leaked sheets like regular underwear these would good child little accidents awake my son never accidents awake , not worth high price , since regular undies work fine awake he like design comfort though they cute 
-1	when i bought i loved it ! smooth plastic , easy read display nice look after 4 months started giving wrong readings so i call customer service do nothing ! even though i filled warranty ! unreal ! so i busted scale ! fao schwarz horrible company deal ! buy a different brand !

-1	these cups ok what i n't like whenever straw inserted cup amount liquid inside , liquid shoots straw flows , making mess almost every single time i straw cup n't create problem the version cups spout much better would not recommend wo n't buying

-1	for intents purposes , bag job it 's big needs home i diaper laundry every day bag kind pain wash i use hanging bag 's ok - , not favorite i like kanga care 's wet bags , round ones zippers 
-1	this product not like photo the photo makes look like 's free-standing , circular bag it 's not free-standing at all - not least bit it also oval shape it much thinner i expected it came package 4 inches square 1 inch thick we 'll see works , far , i unimpressed not like i thought would 
-1	this favorite bag zipper broke ! ! we 6 months happened i really n't want pay another 20bucks happen it perfect size masked odor i disappointed say goodbye one !

-1	these huge ! i thought would baby 's drool babes eat not i wanted ! but could want ! 
-1	these bigs nice soft , like aden + anais products however , extremely large ! much big 8 month old i would love smaller size , used teething/drool bibs 
-1	these bibs really cute material not made purpose they stain easily n't wipe well they not thick enough kind heavy duty spillage 
-1	sure , nice soft highly attractive like aden anais products they might even work moderate drooler but son heavy drooler they ended soaking entirely ( entire front onesie ) within hour i 'm not sure even possible goes maybe 3-4 green sprouts semi-waterproof bibs per day ( , 5 luvable friends bibs ) these bibs opposite waterproof they soak much spit help transfer wetness directly onto shirt , leaving baby 's chest wet - bib feels half wet for cost less , i wish i gotten ten green sprouts bibs instead really wish worked , high hopes i definitely not purchasing 
-1	these soak water become useful even , material n't go dark enough/thick enough satisfying it 's pale hard see my kids n't like much 've opted brands bathtub crayons 
-1	my daughters 2 4 we 've bath crayon 's know try keep water part lets realistic they kids crayons get dropped water they begin dissolving immediately i doubt last 4 baths these junk opinion 
-1	badly stained nothing i try helping color shows everything i like snaps though

-1	i bought ikea 's really cute , gets mildewy quickly even though i 'd peel every use hang then mold stained mat i tried washing vinegar bleach could not get stains as cute , i would n't purchased i 'd known would get much mildew 
-1	this cute bath mat we like 's longer bath mats unfortunately , n't stick bathtub we 've tried 3 different bathtubs results needless say , longer use i would n't recommend bath mat moves around floats , 's not good little ones new & # 34 ; big & # 34 ; bath want stay safe 
-1	many moms swear amber teething necklaces i purchased one desperation my infant son constantly fussy apparent reason , i tried teething necklace i guess teething n't issue time , made difference it also annoyed when older i sure really teething , hated necklace would n't even let put -- neck , ankle , wrist , anywhere eventually i gave necklace away neighbor it well made the clasp beads seemed secure no problems quality 
-1	pros : it looks nice made canada cons : very thin material paddingthe flannel part material made cotton obviously becomes useless soiled the outer backing pad made pvc ! ! ! off-gasses terribly one worst plastics baby near we already one pad came skip hop diaper bag i hoping get something on-par perhaps larger skip-hop pad nicely cushioned sides high quality polyester material easily wiped clean

-1	i purchased 18m old daughter 's room we old crane frog humidifier broken 4 years use this humidifier cute cord super short the knob adjusts flow not adjustable would think at lowest possible setting , room looked like smokey fire room she literally hard find middle night humidification mist i n't know , maybe 's defective one i returning purchasing crane monkey room 
-1	i bought humidifier 2 years ago older daughter 's room with forced hot water baseboard heat , winter important humidify bedrooms night comfortable sleeping starting early toddlerhood would get bloody noses frequency n't run humidifier ; parent try stop 15 month old 's bloody nose understand 'd want avoid situation ! this cute humidifier little monkey peeking a cool mist humidifier best choice terms safety toddler/small child might play knock humidifier there significant downsides humidifier , though we found reservoir small needs refilled daily basis 're running highest setting the entire humidifier also very difficult clean lot small nooks crannies ca n't wash since cool mist humidifier , mold mildew real concern mild asthma baby sister sharing room not mold spores floating round mist after 2 winters use , i plugged tonight discovered wo n't produce mist anymore i guess got money 's worth 2 winters daily use , either replacing crane teardrop cool mist humidifier warm mist unit 
-1	i bought replace larger whole-house style humidifier ultimately disappointing pros : - quiet enough not disturb baby- ability aim mist top ( turns direct mist ) - tank not heavy could filled bathroom sink- bottom base , easy clean ( not easy clean water tank ) - tight seal bottom tank- no filters replace ( though require useless protect cartridges ) cons : - if n't leave water base ( walk carefully back room ) , load water tank onto clean , empty base 1/3 water tank immediately `` lost '' refill tank make night- impossible clean water tank ( despite soaking bleach vinegar ) - nasty pink stuff growing could n't reached - soaking vinegar n't work , neither bleach- plastic flimsy - tank cracked middle second winter ( though i washing thing every single day best gentle not bang sink attempting reach mold inside ) for $ 25 i paid , got winter i learned valuable lesson `` cool mist '' humidifiers - avoid i actually ended writing review today i researching safety types units turns , cool mist humidifiers potential cause real harm spreading microbes minerals water air my next purchase `` warm mist '' humidifier , uv light 
-1	i recommend using syringe dispense baby 's medication nipple , without bottle attached ( not using bottle , use nipple nipple base baby not risk choking nipple ) be sure hold nipple tip-down ( e g rest tip-down bottle cap ) medication pools nipple not get dispersed sides bottle 
-1	these not good , lid n't secure enough after spilling plenty medicine ordered munchkin brand 
-1	i bought sterilized already top half wo n't fit bottom half somehow plastic shrink steam sterilization wo n't click back together matter hard i tried needless say i n't even get chance use unless 
-1	would n't stick oven matter i tried complete waste money even , i hard time believing adhesive would withstood amount pulling yanking child wish i could return 
-1	before buying check see work oven we ordered wo n't work oven handle close top door oven lock flap gets caught handle closing we kitchen aid oven thick rounded handle spanning width door looks like would good product worked us , though this seems happening much baby-proofing stuff 've ordered online be careful consider item fit application buying 
-1	loved lock third time i used oven 425 25 minutes adhesive got hot lock melted waste money if anyone know heatproof adhesive i could use , i 'm ears 
-1	good idea , however not work my oven handle way i think would good product oven handle n't high oven 
-1	did n't fit oven handle way it would help product description included something 
-1	i bought two i double oven this product not work well double oven i went put lock lower oven realized i attach , lock would block upper oven opening , one i use most also , uses adhesive stick , may void warranty oven this may work great single ovens i would n't recommend double ovens 
-1	ovens get hot ( duh ) adhesive n't stick oven used fell days 
-1	this n't work all stove came lot i worried 'd fall open oven i moving things in/out i removed i n't think glue could hold 's heat coming oven 
-1	the product looks ok n't work oven ( ge profile ) n't enough clearance oven door handle top door lock fit i 'll returning looking another option 
-1	same complaint everyone else the tape n't stay stuck long i figured must super powerful adhesive , spit would work almost well 
-1	carefully followed directions still n't stick , easily fell i tested trying open oven 
-1	unlike reviewers , adhesive n't problem us the latch flap continually flopping getting way closing oven door and 's hot , 's coin toss whether locks not i 'm not sure 's worth aggravation it 's less hassle keep eye daughter 's kitchen something i 'm anyway 
-1	the hing really strong not work oven sticky side joke i cleaned oven door surface still could not get stick well enough work 
-1	this latch broke 2 months use ! it 's sticky stuff anyway should better quality hold , trying keep kids safe ! 
-1	this n't stick us every time adult went use oven , mindlessly pulled door - forgetting lock - regular adult strength popped every time after got knocked 3 times , never going stick 
-1	we live manhattan apartment small stove try product this not fit period 
-1	this came first time got hot do ge profile slightly rounded front n't seated way back ( close not quite way ) - i think could n't take stove getting hot 
-1	i guess 's not standard size , handle door prevents installed word 
-1	this worked well month then became increasingly difficult slide , finally got would hang , i pop open open close oven door , even though hands full whatever i cooking finally melted one day husband cooking something got caught door this allowed oven knob covers melt , , sooo really disappointed we 're trying brand time 
-1	i tried another style lock http : //www amazon com/gp/product/b008tgfk1q/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00 ? ie=utf8 & psc ; =1 frigidaire oven door n't right design when i saw picture particular lock i knew right away frigidaire oven the 3 star rating almost swayed not order based photo i knew would position properly oven i right easy install , fits correctly , works hoping last satisfied ** update sept 27 - hinge ended breaking couple months , take buy different style i would n't buy given broke couple months use 
-1	i bought previous ones 4 tabs now seems changed design 5 tabs , 's not compatible previous ones no indication packaging boo pros : + durable foam surface , n't scratch floorcons : - i n't like removable shapes 's cracks liquids ( like saliva ) leak through - also , baby removes shapes , 's hard floor below - i also n't like multi-colored tiles i ca n't see colorful toys stepped next time i 'm going get plain neutral mat 
-1	the patterns cute , bibs really thin my baby 's shirt underneath gets wet quickly normal amount drool 
-1	i initially bought thinking would make life easier really , 's not necessary definitely not worth money i steam bottles vegetable steamer easily i ended returning 
-1	i used product first time today already packed returned after one use following instructions clean sterilizer prior first use , metal heating bottom part turned brown two spots created strange burnt plastic smell i saw previous reviews tends happen months , i n't expect first use will stick microwave steam sterilizer doesnt create smell fire hazard beware ! 
-1	total waste money i n't think easier sticking everything pot boiling water completely unnecessary regularly sanitize bottles cleaning soap water perfectly fine what ripoff 
-1	if 're first time mom 're probably going want bottle sterilizer they 're suppose fast convenient opposed tedious process boiling baby 's bottles pacifiers water five minutes the reality , sterilizer really n't necessary it nice one , n't need it if decide want sterilizer , i would not recommend one for one , 's pricey sterilizer store somewhere i find contraption rather bulky even ample countertop space kitchen , i 'm not willing sacrifice amount space sterilizer takes as big sterilizer , fit maximum six avent bottles , nipples , collars caps device one time if six bottles run 'll one cycle sterilizing plus 'll wait heating element cool use again the sterilizer complete cycle approximately seven minutes promised that certainly quicker waiting big pot water boil stove , 's not impressive microwave bottle sterilizers personally , i think avent stay away electronic devices heat things their bottle warmer performs badly , sterilizer worked one , one time i call customer service device died first use fortunately , customer service great offered send new sterilizer within 7-10 business days i 'm still waiting replacement , i n't high expectations new one better if serious getting sterilizer , i 'd strongly suggest buy avent microwave sterilizer instead i happen one i fit many bottles microwave version i electric one also , i sterilize bottles microwave one less time electric one requires and let 's not forget microwave sterilizer costs considerably less money takes less space overall , i would not recommend 4 1 electric steam sterilizer it 's simply not worth cost hassle dealing poorly designed device 
-1	paid good money for this thing and it did n't even last 5 months total piece of crap and can not and will not recommend to anyone 
-1	like mix match different nipples bottles really bad thing leaky get using ring inside bottle , not good seal 
-1	seemed like good idea , fact one correct side thing ridiculous baby hated , would pull time i kept try insert right side they went trash never actually used 
-1	the picture shows four pacifiers four different colors the actual product two pacifiers identical clear if two babies , ca n't tell pacifier baby the picture misleading ! also , pacifiers n't holes nose i babies 8 lbs ( preemie twins one month old ) pacifiers cover part nose make hard breathe i n't think 're safe smaller babies i would advise getting ones holes nose 
-1	the pacifiers great my baby loves it my mistake buy translucent pacifiers do n't once set , hard find , spot baby asleep hustle lights find translucent pacifiers hell my first mistake first mom : wanted & # 34 ; cute & # 34 ; pacifiers forgot practicality avoid translucent i bought colors baby loves so highly recommend brand product , not translucent ones ! 
-1	my child breastfed bottle-fed and i get every baby different , pacifiers poorly designed they slide child 's mouth way easily they need curved stay when breastfeeding nipple supposed touch roof baby 's mouth ; pacifiers go straight back , hence reason fall constantly do n't waste money 
-1	this product broke first use i never made house plastic piece snapped two i purchased reading wonderful reviews i sorely disappointed the metal hook bends n't seem sturdy 's plastic part n't work well weight bearing device i incur cost returning item 
-1	this product worked okay times , i tried different brand , i noticed huge difference this item not nearly sharp precise , i threw one away 
-1	i bought one 2 years ago first child quality much better the fabric softer ( think cotton vs nylon ) , felt padded , featured soft , non-slip grip handle the air version existed i bought first one , i n't see much difference two now , 2 years later i purchased exact model baby # 2 disappointed the fabric ( attractive looking ) not soft , feels cheap , grip handle to get features , have buy air version , shop around , find $ 40 it 's definitely worth extra money imo my daughter onboard35 14 months , soft fabric baby want sleep , soft handle makes carrier comfortable hold , must-have 
-1	i guess get pay , i hoping would little nicer it comes lot accessories , soo cheap ! i worried would n't hold in opinion 's worth spend little something last 
-1	very nice design leaked often not i buy large inserts prewashed shrunk im not sure 's issue i need buy medium insert mom 3 month old 
-1	i received stroller , assembled ease , put baby sent decided return the seat shallow she 9 months without footrest propped like laying flat board so strange i expect britax everything else stroller perfect very lightweight , easy fold , sleek looking it also strolled like breeze i could not get past seat issue i googled issue immediately found stroller voluntary recall ! the break system not engage strollers very unsafe we opted mutsy easyrider $ 9 i review stroller arrives 
-1	i purchased britax b-nimble alternative large/ heavy bob stroller ( i love way ! ) i researched & read dozens reviews best lightweight stroller bells & whistles i looking if i tested b-nimble store - i would not bought it not nearly nimble 's name ! and price/ brand , poor design ( simple umbrella stroller marketed something ) in summary , con 's outweight pro 's stroller i wish i returned right away : - ( pros -- fabric nice & durable , i think also remove cover wash ( n't yet , since i avoid using stroller due con 's - see ) - lightweight- shoulder strap handy- the extendable footrest nice- center lock 5 point harness nice & easy use cons -- handling/ manuverability terrible maybe 's two front-wheel design , 's not easy steer forward simple ground surfaces - wheels get caught easily & n't parallel times , one `` flip '' around stop forward movement re-align wheels - canopy awkward & flimsy it also n't pull low enough shield sun/ rain/ wind daughters ' face - the rear `` step-down '' lock holds stroller open broken , plastic piece spins around foot trying lock open stroller - the mesh basket underneath way small but i guess 's get umbrella stroller - you need hands open & close stroller and cases , awkward do - does n't recline flat position - the parent cupholder constantly falling - opening & closing , moving stroller place place it 's n't stay put , end leaving , not place put bottles/ cups 
-1	the pul covers thin kind stiff plus 've issues loose stitching snaps coming and fasten diaper , tabs curl back they bargain-priced reason if looking cheap high quality cover i would suggest reliable brand like bummis super lite , sweet pea econobum 
-1	my son bathed toys since infant i wish someone told exposure latex ( natural rubber ) make people develop latex allergy he latex allergy age two i would not recommend toys worst enemy 
-1	our toddler able reach door knobs needed something help prevent locking room these ok , i sprung something bit nicer the two pieces snap together kinda poorly clamping area bottom use grasp knob flimsy really work get doors open adult smaller door knobs wo n't work the lock cover molded silicon easy enough open , 's hard seat spend little money get something nicer these keep everyone 
-1	this product not work if door nob not really small , rubber inside catch door nob even smallest pressure , even turning product , open my 2 year old opened 1 night we even tried carve rubber inside completely , , could open our door nob n't huge anything , i 'm not sure 's going even 1 year old barely reach door nob open pulls product enough turn useless household 
-1	i originally bought keep cat opening door food stored i put sudden able open easily ! i n't rate lock intended toddlers , not cats , perhaps would work better there i tried toddler sure enough : get sisters ' room easily ! 
-1	my baby squirming active 6 week old , getting keep arm , & # 34 ; god forbid & # 34 ; anus task gets us worked will looking 10 second reader 
-1	i bought thermometer hand newborn i thought quick come i wish i would found much quicker ( less 10 seconds ) thermometers first not wasted time money one it takes long us n't seem accurate ( seems like reads cooler actual temp ) 
-1	this slowest thermometer ever made seriously it took nearly hundred years take baby 's temp it creeps tenth degree second , starting 96 degrees yikes 
-1	as first time mom i bought everything possible plus this one purchases i think better buying essential , better quailty individually the thermometer included cheap not work two uses i ended buying rectal thermometer works great the kit come pair nail clippers designed babies work great 's not useful 
-1	thought baby would really like buttons easy push 's lightweight ca n't get there on/off switch volume insanely low barely hear 
-1	our baby not really go phone the buttons not interesting , say thing this lasted seconds tossed aside , even 7 month old move something else interesting she absolutely loves fisher price laugh & learn smilin ' smart phone , dollars end one pretty worthless ! 
-1	these would nice spout thicker my son chewed hole one use 
-1	my son chewed top silicone spout right away , cup became useless otherwise works fine 
-1	at first i thought i found something get son bottle this really good fit getting drink milk give baby bottle unfortunately nipple started leak months washing top rack dishwasher i 'm super bummed ! 
-1	the cup used , must drink water looked , inconvenient , i give daughter bought new suction cup 
-1	got new one , higher weight limit height limit , back rickity attachment seat that one reasons i got one the old one evenflow well 
-1	i went back forth whether purchase high chair son , larger size age ( 97 % height 80 % weight ) i read reviews carefully decided enough reviewers noted high chair , appearing small , fit larger baby fine i really like baby bjorn brand ( organic bouncer ) chair looked simple easy clean however , received chair assembled ( super easy ) , i could n't believe the chair look like doll , one reviewer previously noted i put son chair - 5 months old time - chunky legs barely fit underneath tray another problem high chair not adjustable terms height recline- one position , one position even though son sit without assistance , i still like recline feature new high chair bought if want nice high chair , go peg perego siesta - multiple positions , reclines wheels move around house the baby bjorn chair might great families , ultimately , son would outgrown 7-8 months not worth cost ; plenty high chairs safe , easy clean support baby well 
-1	this could maybe work someone king bed we queen way big use , not mention 's heavy clunky , plus son hated laid not mention legs defective will not stay the snugglenest much better option we returning 
-1	this thing bed hog ! unless king , not space two adults center bed plus , sides rigid want sleep hand baby arm going lose feeling 5 minutes also , kid likes sleep arms wo n't enough room we returned one night we used contoured changing pad placed us instead structured cosleeping apartus worked great felt silly n't think start it high enough sides wo n't roll baby ( not would anyway ) soft enough hand baby forearm resting edge still comfortable if eventually sidecar crib bed , easily transition pad onto mattress kiddo big enough lay mattress but best part little one still sleeping pad bed , put pad edge bed ( spouse drag edge closest standing holding sleeping baby ) , put kiddo , drag center bed wo n't wake baby put easily n't really moving move pad around if want baby closer one night , pull pad we used summer infant pad i cut seat belt part then got cover pad soft warm baby this pad : http : //www amazon com/summer-infant-contoured-frustration-packaging/dp/b009edswja/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid ; =1363819860 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =contoured+changing+pad 
-1	it n't work us it almost fell bed someone would move that baby really physically wants right next anyways it 's good idea reality 's not right solution a next bed bassinet would much safer useful we use travel changing station though , i gave two stars 
-1	i ordered bc 'airyness ' product i thought looked sporty would great walks bc gets hot summer i disappointed bc 1 ) material stiff cutting baby 's leg , 2 ) fit much different babybjorn miracle organic the organic gave much support i usually walk 40mins baby miracle organic 10 minutes airy i go home bc back hurting i n't recommend i gave 2 star bc look cool 
-1	very thin trim around edge tend ball not spread i found similar ones babies r us far superior quality the colors cute though 
-1	bought thought n't made china , big deal first child made china 
-1	we dr brown 's glass bottles we ordered ended returning it good job steaming bottles , however , would literally take 18 hours bottles fully dry came plus , water would run everywhere opened different layers not worth money effort 
-1	my babies 9 lbs 5 oz 2 months skinny little girl i 've using flip covers great success got lured cute patterns best bottom diapers the single row snaps waist cause flaps stick front the gussets bunched leave significant red marks thighs i imagine even worse n't itty bitty thighs i wish i stuck flip covers 
-1	my little chunker not fit well , despite well within weight limits product it leaves big red gashes chunky little legs i love prints , seems hold washing really well , 's definitely not first choice diapers 
-1	i read reviews i bought item i honestly thought reviews harsh i thought , heck , i 'll try well , reviews spot it really looked like came dollar store there ac hole cord box like reviews said the worst thing order change settings get screw driver , unscrew panel , remove batteries flip switch ugh , i returned product thank goodness i bought amazon not random seller return policy amazon gave refund five stars amazon , zero stars product 
-1	love idea not practical graco babytrend carseats because location carseat handles upright toys end close child 's ' face not focus

-1	the covers look nice make old crib look new , scent , omg it smells like bad chemicals so i washed twice seemed better until weeks later then started smell ! not sure made i actively looking something replace son able stand put hands mouth product that not ok opinion 
-1	product not meet expectations , tie strings short overall bad design crib found design make pintrest purchased would suggest buying fabric making 
-1	we convertible crib barely year old not fit - ties way short i already stupidly threw package away i stuck item i ca n't use i add n't smell seems decent quality - make ties longer add not fit cribs 
-1	i bummed product not work the mane fell place the back thick daughters head forced forward bad position 
-1	i looking shopping cart high chair cover almost 6-months old baby girl call germaphobe , like people looking item , i wanted something would prevent direct contact grimy carts/high chairs daughter 's mouth the description cover seemed everything i looking : plush cover , pretty neutral colors , easy slip , and folds easily handy tote bag plus , price hard beat needless say , i sold immediately ordered cover i excited receive cover could n't wait use right away when i took packaging , i satisfied then i tried fold `` handy tote '' ripped ! ! ! the material started fray seams started come undone and 's not like i tugging cover get fold the cover simply way bulky tote material ( outer part would touching cart ) way flimsy accommodate product i could dealt bulkiness product folded , not handy described , poor quality material definitely packing back return so disappointed ! 
-1	i used never used -- probably sell consignment the fabric slippery daughter slid around grocery cart seat could n't stay sitting comfortably i kept stop re-position 'd slide sideways seat every couple minutes ( yes -- old/big enough could sit ) it 's also bulky not convenient unpack set re-pack might well trying use sleeping bag cart cover -- 's slippery , bulky thing reminded ! now i wipe surfaces cart 'll touch wipes i put 's perfectly happy fabric padding precious bottom cart seat i think one products sounds great think 'll need baby ends utterly unnecessary 
-1	this carrier well made i n't like work get little situated it 's almost like need someone help get reasonable amount time safely i returned baby bjorn carrier instead 
-1	this product okay , i 'm skinny not anorexic , normal like size 6/8 ( lost weight pregnancy ) wayyy much fabric hangs if i much larger person i think would fit much comfortably i wrap around baby many times keep straps dragging knees i 'm 5 ' 4 & # 34 ; it ended taking much time put take month i quit using i also n't like i need assistance put baby back my husband military away pregnancy care baby i bought carrier i n't someone help get back i ended another one it durable , well made comfortable , not functional me bottom line : if petite like 's much hassle deal extra fabric straps it would nice different sizes , not 
-1	for baby still doesnt like cause legs spread far go around i wont using till atleastget hislegsaroundmy waist comfortably hes 2 months using carrier thinner crotch area 
-1	what i like : - there detachable hood i wish non-wrap/sling carriers covers came hoods ! hoods provide privacy quiet addition warmth & weather protection - it easy snap cover carrier straps - the foot pocket not large , slightly adjustable better pocket what i n't like : - the snaps attach cover carrier 's straps not secure ! mine may defective , one cover 's snaps wo n't stay closed light tug , better still somewhat easy detach - the material incredibly flimsy `` hoodie '' makes sound like nice cozy sweatshirt- n't this thin material you get pay for the faulty snaps make impossible use in event mine defective , i would recommend mild weather either need hood little extra leg protection the idea excellent- 's execution flawed 
-1	i bought set toddler son christmas i get sale , forty dollars the pillowcase poorly sewn i could done better job high school home economics the sheets soft , almost satiny feel weird , since set cotton ( ? ? ? ) i disappointed i received package i thought i buying sheet set , pillowcase comforter the package said 'bedspread ' instead comforter , back called quilt i would not bought knowing bedspread thin one child warmer blankets currently uses 'bedspread ' sheet set n't look like mickey either overall wished found something else bought time could n't find mickey mouse toddler sets would suggest look around store/online maye find something better

-1	this product laughable best it definitely falls category & # 34 ; stuff convince first time parents buy & # 34 ; it really n't even 's intentional job well - shield baby sun , openings sides sun easily seeps burn baby do n't waist money product really useless go buy coolibar uva/uvb blanket instead cover stroller/baby seat also n't do n't put carseat car you 'll burn baby , carseats hot enough !

-1	if techy husband ca n't figure screaming baby arms , product not job quick convenient least not enough purposes 
-1	firstly , 2 stars good use lasted well general look thing so got baby born october n't need right away sat save uses she enjoyed cooler bottles born anyway i found fast enough suit needs , 's straight forward , simple , stylish i 'm exhausted middle night , 's much convenient pop bottle , turn timer relax fussy baby warms those good things after moved last month , started using time much colder the warm bottles helped keep whole body warm i loved warmer unfortunately , one month use , 's shot the timer n't work anymore i turn dial fill warm , stay way indefinitely not ticking , anything maybe new knob would fix ( knob i 'd looking one month use one dies ? ) , i 'd rather find another warmer i using multiple times day ( formula fed baby pre-made bottles fridge ) , i 'd think something made warm bottles would stamina , not mention price you 'd think price , 'd lot better quality i n't found case we 've stopped using may well bowl water if use warmer every , would still alright choice not , not anymore 
-1	i really wish i could go back time tell not buy this i dropped $ 70 , money tight right first baby born but i thought , save sanity , people reviewed say not so at first , thrilling use whatever bottle wanted use the kozii warms ! we use doctor browns emfamil warmed nicely however , became apparent keeping thing clean full babysitting job if n't full right recommendations , took longer bottles warm , meant dealing screaming baby longer yikes but n't deal breaker we could babysit the random thing months , started taking longer longer warm bottles , sorta like dying ? so make things efficient , started holding bottles faucet water hot yes , quicker using kozii ! at first , average , 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes warm kozii we started bottle warming , got baby changed , came back done then maybe 5 months , came back , bottle n't warm yet so started putting longer the last time i used kozii , week ago , i put 6oz bottle 11 minutes according timer , right temperature my baby wo n't take bottle 's cold but i ca n't spend 11 minutes warming bottle so plan purchasing , know keep clean right water level , may last around 5 months to , n't cutting $ 70 product oh , weirdly enough , bottle gets warm kozii done , take bottle , way shut device you let run full amount left timer i guess could unplug ? anyway , conclusion , i not completely dissatisfied product disappointed quality cost much

-1	our lo doesnt seem like using , i think silicone part tough he hold well doesnt like chewing 
-1	seemed like good idea , put banana gets really messy/ put plum , wo n't actually squeeze my baby n't care , either cute design , easy wash but 's and using short time period , even baby likes it 
-1	i going try blueberries , sister said blueberry skins hard get things like we tried bananas instead i n't realize bananas pulpy the brown pulp center banana ( sorry real name ) like glue got stuck everything wearing his shirt washcloth ruined after several washes would n't come looked disgusting thankfully one awesome summer bibs , n't affected this sitting drawer ever since

-1	we bought bottles months ago local store liquid routinely leaks sides lid , even flip-top closed we also one bottle shatter dropped feet ground 
-1	these cups leak two places , air flow valve cap around top it 's not impossible get straw back flip top cleaning , 's not terribly easy time either within hour first washing cup helping son learn use straw top , milk spots , puddles drops high chair , floor , pants ( sat lap ) , clothes i actually would far happier leaked straw ! that i could understand , hard screw go ? i 've played tight i twist i 'm sure i 'll continue hopes i minimize leakage much possible but , n't complicated the straw take practice , i tried first it 's straw shaped , bite press teeth along valve straw order get fluid not bad design all my hope i 'll find `` sweet spot '' able get real use cup we 'll see 
-1	i thought looked awesome based shape different textures , not get baby one 
-1	looks like described but baby n't like it 's big mouth he 5 month old

-1	i exclusive pumper baby would n't latch over time supply started diminishing i found flangs medela pump uncomfortable after hearing about i thought answer they n't they uncomfortable , even really why not make silicone rather hard plastic ? i hope someone designs flang breast pumping comfortable 
-1	i agree previous reviewer , not moms my complaints:1 ) i still lean forward for reason , angle not help all 2 ) i lost suction flanges , resulting reduced pumping output since i exclusively pump , major problem ! 3 ) i sometimes like move flanges around mid-pump better attach nipple sometimes flanges would disconnect entirely connector i this never happened medela flanges

-1	buyer beware : made in china we got seat toddler loved purple color without entirely unpacking seat i could see issue upper headrest seat belt attachment i would n't stay place the seat seem flimsy and smell overwhelmingly horrible not plastic packing bag also foam inside chair smelled horrible before purchasing i contacted company levels bromide , lead chlorine seat considering toxic smell response puzzling maybe thought i asking exterior seat fabric only the rep said : '' all diono products ( car seats , boosters travel accessories ) comply us , european canadian regulations regarding toxic substances phthalates , bromides , bisphenol-a ( bpa ) , cadmium lead neither process fabrics using changed since 2009 rated highly terms low toxicity out-gassing our goal develop fabric required additional fr treatment to end , already started path our new radianr series seats feature seats colors called 'storm ' 'rugby ' seats feature new micro-mesh velour fabric made without requiring additional flame retardant treatment the storm rugby not available monterey process not changed monterey covers since sunshine kids `` my thoughts : obviously diono not yet accomplished goal lowering products toxicity level and i not know quality level sunshine kids the 2008 radian xt not issue i returned seat amazon

-1	our bag broken we using cover july 2013 - flight panama us ( 1 connection ) arrived ok sept 12 , 2013 - direct flight panama uruguay arrived ok sept 13 , 2013 - transporting bag hotel , first strap broke one strap inadequate amount weight , 're anyway oct 7 , 2013 - airport , seam tears open bag gash several inches long so , 're primarily using cover it better nothing , i think durable product would cost $ 8-10 , not sure replace since 're still south america our broken bag makes car seat transport even worse already was padding straps almost non-existent , not comfortable bag seams weak zipper sticks sometimes the metal strap broke did not test sample bags started selling ? i sure hope n't use manufacturer car seat ! ! 
-1	the bag material nice high quality seems solid airline check-in , etc the issue incredibly awkward carry the radian heavy , would essentially impossible carry one shoulder i think the backpack function ergonomically poor , straps long even shortest length , causing seat pull away back hang low beneath butt not heavy , truly awkward uncomfortable carry i almost want return , think i keep storage case i want check gate someday ( i carry bag well gate use shoulder straps directly seat carry instead ) 
-1	good concept a beast stroller very wide heavy nice quality fabric i returned stroller bumbleride indie

-1	let preface saying i n't usually write harsh reviews 's unfortunate product missed mark but i also worry reviews may misleading perhaps even false- something i 've heard n't encountered many years i always looking ways organize home since i like neat so i came across product , i ordered immediately especially i saw great reviews but , i 'm not sure reviews fully accurate reported amazon notice reviews not verified purchasers , entered within month april within span days , click see reviews person many review universal product that makes wonder- not making accusation , seems odd n't ? ? ? now , product arrived i actually quite hopeful seemed like good quality decent plastic ( another reviewer said flimsy i thought opposite ) , very easy adjust three different sizes , came additional basket storage could useful , right size fit cupboard shelf ( maybe little big fridge freezer though ) make sure note try put assembled sippy cups , lids make get stuck the bottles- 'll store pieces want use product this might personal preference i always take extra minutes roughly assemble things i grab use if use basket separate might not big deal , 'll use brand avoid extra effort but , even i took apart , things n't fall smoothly i tried bottles , sippy cups , cans , baby food , etc nothing flowed smoothly i made sure brand sort worked however , least 75 % time , i got pulling two things , would get stuck behind big center column there 's much space right really work this appears design flaw- instead vertical , probably would worked horizontal with first son , i hated equipment cupboard i 've second i want efficiency since i less time this great idea it reminds old soda dispenser/stackers large plastics company used sell mom those worked well annoying fill ( n't needed since soda companies making boxes flap remove ) too bad n't work well i 'm printing return labels

-1	it looks like gift want make gift but buy , 's not practical 
-1	this great product theory , practice n't live promise i gave two stars because:1 it n't heat enough , soak warm water heat pain i prefer double-folded washcloth , moistened , microwaved less 20 seconds it 's hot , fast , easy , soothing 2 the shape gel pack makes possible cover one area breast the hole nipple extreme edge , bulk pack covers one area breast , fine treating single plugged duct , treating mastitis simply engorgement , coverage helpful 3 the inner edge nipple hole not sharp 's covered terry cloth cover , damage nipple , touch painful more effort made make area around nipple softer less likely ever touch nipple ( even terry cloth portion ) 4 the standard recipe quick relief engorgement plugged ducts apply heat every pumping nursing session cold immediately 10 minutes this would pretty impossible even two sets packs for reasons , seems like good old booby tubes still better option i found kids ' booboo buddies , basically gel packs shapes , useful anyway , easier avoid nipple entirely please note : suffering sore breasts nipples , contact breastfeeding counselor information breastfeed painlessly breastfeeding not hurt , , please get help in us , many local health departments free breastfeeding support persons available wic programs , la leche league international ( llli org ) offers free breastfeeding support information around world local groups leaders many breastfeeding problems frustrating greatly alleviated help trained support person 
-1	i not enjoy using product in particular , n't expect gel pack warm within 10 minutes , especially 've refrigerated make cool the product instructions disclosed heating time room temperature and even warm , really warmer running washcloth really hot water tap you n't really need pay product 's going lose heat almost instantly my engorged breasts agony cabbage leaves ultimately brought engorgement , immediate relief , i used old fashionhot water bottleand trick even used cold pad , n't seem effective assoothies gel pads , amazing initial nipple soreness pain starting breastfeeding newborn if severe nipple cracking bleeding however ( i trying nurse tongue tied baby ) , ought consider asking ob midwife prescribe something called triple nipple cream ( also called dr jack newman 's nipple ointment ) heal nipples 24 hours the prescription compounded ( mixed together ) pharmacy , 'll check make sure pharmacy stock ( a mom 's tip : 24 hour pharmacies tend different drugs readily stock b/c never know prescription need filled urgently overnight ) if found review helpful , please let know 
-1	as lactation educator , i excited see product offered amazon vine however , certainly use , seemingly clever design not helpful one would imagine firstly , small breasted woman , product huge if large breasted probably appreciated , definitely designed d cup b c while would seem n't matter , product n't mold breast well smaller woman also , hole center shield nipple temperature ( used hot cold ) clever , i suppose , sore nipple , sometimes want relief ! also , sore damaged nipple terry cloth cover going stick skin , since not hold there the weakest part product though ca n't heat microwave you meant put hot water heat when i hot/cold pack ( i usually use flax seeds ) , i keep freezer , ready use cold , i want warm , pop microwave if kept freezer , i imagine many cycles hot water would go could useful and not kept freezer , would quite wait time would ready well i would not recommend planning use microwave instructions plastic clearly not appropriate purpose in general , i would see practical use product engorgement cold helpful however , best remedy engorgement nurse often ! ! this nice idea i think sock full flax rice useful

-1	the 3-in-1 idea excellent , little potty looks attractive like miniature normal toilet , found toilet pretty useless honestly - you buy specific arm hammer wipes fit slot , well specific air freshener top inside lid , 's extra money care keeping features for starters , shouldnt need air freshener potty , seeing n't flush obviously would immediately cleaning toddler finishes using it - this lot parts , something two year old son wants play instead use correctly - there grips bottom thing prevent sliding child uses ( that 's lime green rubber strip bottom front back ) everytime son sat , still scooted back , use stepping stool get onto big toilet , still moves sitting toilet toes scraping little - on seat , urine guard comes little keep pee splashing my son average size two year old , seat opening not big enough his `` junk '' sits top urine guard unless reposition show move around how still managed get money thing : - not buying air freshener refill wipes all - giving seat portion , pops easy cleaning , mother-in-law time snaps onto regular toilet seat fit transition stage big potty - we use entire toilet nothing stepping stool son get potty , like i said slide little tile floor makes son go `` whoa ! whoa mommy ! '' hah or also wash hands - i planning reselling son n't need seat adjuster in-law 's house anymore in opinion , i n't think toddler potties worth money buy adjusters toilets home , travel seat throw diaper bag this unnecessary baby item , many days 
-1	the arm & hammer secure comfort potty seat large standard toilet seat we regular ( round ) toilet , potty seat long , front back though seemed like good product otherwise , send back also , fyi , deodorizing disk back fairly strong scent , one remove easily desired 
-1	i bought i liked idea handles i thought well two different shaped toilets home 'll least fit one other reviewers mentioned worked round toilets n't fit toilets our oval toilets new , also one round toilet 80s n't fit , either bummer we ended buying prince lionhart weepod , basix better product ! it fits toilets , easy clean , lightweight , secure , super cushy/comfortable my daughter loves sit it prince lionheart weepod basix , ash grey 
-1	we got returned there enough space not efficient we ended getting munchkin plastic organizer shelf could store much n't need precious counter space 
-1	the plies wipes n't really come 1 1 , dispenser suppose good window show much wipes left though it easy clean but n't work 
-1	not i expected i bought it insert weight put top wipes 
-1	i honestly think made difference wipes i still issues pulling wipes often times would tear i even got needless say i returned 
-1	i love i n't want expensive one warmed wipes so i love way looks , unfortunately 2 months use n't close right anymore i put something heavy ontop keep lid shut really disappointing otherwise would 5 stars 
-1	i looking forward convenience nursery , i 'm completely inconvenienced arrived broken : latch n't work wo n't close oxo usually solid brand , i 'm obviously disappointed quality product 
-1	this seemed like neat concept , product left lot desired for one thing ( main thing ) , night vision terrible i camera 7 feet away crib , monitors i 've owned not super clear nighttime picture range , camera i could n't even tell baby crib ! one neat features device tracks alert movement room ; however , since ca n't see baby , n't work either night/in dark since times i 'm monitoring daughter 's completely dark room , deal breaker me the major issue ever stayed connected 5-10 minutes then would tell i 'd lost connection attempt reconnect failed sometimes i could go app manually reconnect , often would n't even let i hear daughter naturally room cries night , 's n't main issue if relying monitor hear 's going baby 's room , huge problem ( i used monitor 5 nights never stayed connected ) i also realized i actually n't like monitor phone i like make calls , answer emails , things phone daughter napping , i n't like sacrifice able see you keep app running background , 's sound ( good making phone call ) , whenever i disconnected even quicker i since purchased infant optics dxr-8 loving ! 
-1	in shopping preparing baby , withings smart baby monitor ended biggest regret purchase this splurge new baby 's nursery i felt i could justify price safety the fact check baby anywhere important since husband away often it seemed like good way still connected town i also liked thought using ipad iphone monitor screen this ended total waste money after complications set , attempted contact customer service , complete joke discovering problem , running the amount delay time makes nervous rely the delay biggest complaint the app often crashes and i found makes sense monitor screen completely dedicated monitoring baby- not ipad iphone , often used tasks the one thing i like monitor aesthetics that 's it 's way expensive something pretty n't work correctly after spending much money still needing working real-time monitor , i issue shelling another expensive monitor our solution cheap $ 20 monitor facetime dad gone 
-1	i loved bag little it lots room great however , three months strap completely ripped i wound different bag since i saw website reviews people problem strap 
-1	i exclusively pump not work ! i broke bought medela finally this would fine pump , not keep milk supply 's extremely slow sometimes malfunctions well i would not recommend product anyone 
-1	your baby love kind paci , mine dont you not attach different kind paci , one paci which also means not removed steralized 
-1	its not water proof baby throws , milk spill liquid accident , 'll wash thing i n't really see point cover since stain go right stain whats inside 
-1	my husband picked walmart they horrible ! ! they constant static noise , extremely annoying they loud , even turn volume way battery life laughably short quality terrible around first time receiver got knocked counter hit floor , started buzzing loudly would not stop same thing happened 2nd receiver couple days later so literally lasted less week we got vtech ones replace , definitely worth extra money ! ! the reason get one star actually function , minimal , terrible way 
-1	i n't understand could fit 35lb child that impossible it trim diaper 's not one size like says my child 21 lbs almost limit diaper fit i n't understand parents could like diaper i love bumgenius fuzzibunz crap 
-1	this cute small super thin blanket i 'm not sure functional reasons you ca n't swaddle 's thin offer warmth 
-1	bought son eczema , soft , good quality never wears easily remove it i bought scratch not instead i happy 
-1	i n't recommend i actually thinking returning product even though baby already used the velcro scratched babys face 
-1	prior britax i tried bell cocoon , i generally liked seat britax rated weight , significantly expensive features adjustable back height reclining back i thought materials good build quality solid the seat fits 17 '' frame diamondback menona , not obstruction way except blocking rear blinking light behind seat initially , i thought way seat connects bike interesting , required much less installation bell cocoon basically , somewhat permanently needs attached bike lock see picture end chrome posts the lock comes adapter three sets 2-each inserts accommodate various frame tube diameter there chrome bars inserted lock spring loaded latch supposed catch prevent coming the seat easily attached detached i problems spring loaded latch actually catching notches it worked well ground , installed would not latch i tried everything i could think fix problem moving lock higher lower frame , trying # 32 # 35 adapter inserts , making sure lock not skewed nothing worked in one position i able move latch closed position hand 's i noticed , lock installed tightened , spring moves latch closed position not seem operate properly inserting seat also required lot jiggling , causing bike , supported kick stand , almost fall in addition , may appearance , seems bell cocoon provides better side protection britax overall , i liked idea seat attaches bike , not seem work situation if works correctly bike , price not issue , seat may good option good features like minimal installation seating position adjustments 
-1	i wanted love i wanted baby love they lovely look , feel lovely ( i love material 're made , feel like extra soft rubber ) , i love 're natural but son hated more pacifier really n't picky pacifiers they tiny little nipple i guess n't like he would suck occasionally pretty easy going baby came pacifiers hit two months old stopped willingly taking he loved soothie pacifiers he currently loves play toy he 'll hold gnaw sides even back looped part ! he still n't like sucking nipple part though ! haha 
-1	i bought 2-pack 12 months pacifier 16-month girl , updated favorite old ones i 've linked herehevea star & moon orthodontic pacifier -0 - 3 months she loves old ones hevea , unfortunately n't sell larger size so come back new ones at beginning , likes similar old styles used but two weeks , refused use one sensitive reaction even though quite sleepy time as i checked pacifier , i found weird thing plastic nipple became flat ( air inside gone ) could n't come back normal shape matter i 've tried pinch back i n't believe 's anything wrong way little girl sucked , ca n't find better way contact seller if photos demanded , always supply 
-1	i 'm not quite sure people labelled aqua/ light turquoise pad cover navy blue , lol they 're two totally different colors i needed navy blue match nursery theme the photo inaccurate well i returned full refund since error i really hope fix ! otherwise , soft touch seems quite durable : ) 
-1	i thought product sounded great , i agree negative reviews the tweezers not open wide enough effective you force open order grab boogies the design n't make sense save money 
-1	i loved idea product not worth money i listened review mentioned tweezers closed position you figure way open keep open able get anything it would much better designed like normal tweezers need squeeze order close points 
-1	you see even padded bra worst made breasts itchy cotton nursing pad much comfortable worth front cost 
-1	there one sticky pad they not stay put nursing bra , tank , stuck inside night shirt my cotton reusable pads stay place well ! if i pull garment way nurse , 's fight i like cup shape absorb , n't stay place i n't leak much though , i n't know well would work someone leaks 
-1	i using avent breast pads since 2006 they absolute favorite pads now , phillips changes now , instead unique pads , like every breast pad market if i wanted lansinoh style pad , i 'd buylansinoh 20265 disposable nursing pads , 60-pack these much larger diameter old ones they significantly thinner , but n't think means n't show- still show the edges large diameter pad bunch itch , particularly underside breast i 'm not fan very disappointed yeah , average pad it like every pad market , i not like why mess good thing ? why remake something unique thing everyone else makes ? it frustrating , sure 
-1	these breast pads contain leaks however , sticky tabs not hold bra in addition , appear lumpy unpadded bra 
-1	thought going & # 34 ; aweome sippy & # 34 ; looking , sadly mistaken the idea neat actual usage not its hard drink , even drink , came weird , giving fact top solid color , cant see fluid coming drinking my husband i problem 2 year old going back i love avent bottles cup didnt cut 
-1	we not able use imposible drink what waste money 
-1	i looking second 360 cup nine month old the store i went n't sassy cup i already , i decided give one try this cup several pieces clean as long take apart , i n't see 's hard get clean no worse bottles i used the plate easy enough activate , causing small amount liquid come i like n't gush , trickle , not cause gagging that 's thing i liked , though tipped upside , n't leakage , n't stand even mild shaking the worst part daughter pushed plate wrong side cup , dribbled front if played cup pushed plate , water leaked floor if held rim , not handles , activated plate water spilled everywhere i hate think mess would i put milk formula the instructions state not use juice cup i guess your floors would stained beyond repair bottom line : save money the sassy brand 360 cup cheaper thousand times better 
-1	i clearly got carried away hype new things transition baby cup wow mom said use cup i i 'm done wired illogical designs time cup , use cup 
-1	my mom bought toddlers , impossible clean top it quickly grew mold despite best efforts keep clean , thrown away it not worth hassle much better dippy cups 
-1	i liked idea cup no spout , teaching drink form cup , etc etc i first saw professional convention , sales rep promised leak cup i asked , toddler holds upside shakes , leaks ? she assured leaks guess what ? even holds 1 handle , 's slightly tilted leaks place i sometimes still use , water n't matter gets water wherever nice concept , flawed execution 
-1	it looks nice , n't ? a cup designed teach toddler drink edge cup , ? i mean , wonderful , right ? wrong ! in order mechanism work properly , child shove his/her face lifted plate , allowing flow liquid mouth if , somehow , lid pressure , it will leak i repeat , it will leak or , it will spill all over your child in the car and , make matters worse , cleaning nuisance for price , product seriously joke flawed every way you 've warned ! 
-1	my toddler tried 18 months leaked spilled everywhere , tried 2 5 problem he drink water bottle adult cup fine , 's like rubber center piece cup forces liquid spread wide small child 's mouth cover , leaks cheeks tries drink he hates thing gets pretty upset thinks i 'm putting milk go cup straw give real thing this cup useless 
-1	i tried dozens different sippy , straw trainer cups worst one far my 18 month old got very frustrated cup i tried well , unless really press nose plate center cup , flow minimal not , i think actually hinders transition normal cup , one biggest hurdles knowing far back tip cup with cup , tip upside , unless press plate , nothing coming also , like avent sippies , valve multiple pieces really taken apart use washed unless want mold growing - even water they say not use cup juice either , i think milk would really get nooks crannies well so least leakproof , right ? sort it 's true n't leak plate n't pressed , n't take much press plate little allow slow dribble for reason i would n't use accident-proof cup car unsupervised use anyway a straw cup works much better purpose if 're restricting water anyway , spend couple weeks transitioning regular cup save hassle another unnecessary `` transitional '' stage sure , spills , faster , use straw cup ( would still adult applications later ) times need something less messy 
-1	the concept great i excited start using cup but leaks like crazy try drink so defeats purpose i would n't buy another one 
-1	it messy son spilled drink everywhere maybe n't ready now using straw i might revisit cup update review 
-1	this cup hard drink - could n't get 2 year old son learn use do n't waste $ $ 
-1	my little guy loves drinking cups i thought would perfect learning they make much mess open cup though i pretty disappointed i love avent products i still cupboard though case 
-1	i recently purchased fisher-price healthy care deluxe booster seat ( $ 26 dollars amazon ) the weekend , mother purchased the first years deluxe reclining feeding seat $ 39 99 target this comparison two chairs the fisher-price chair ( i bought red/white version ) very easy assemble i n't need read directions i put together quickly logically ( whew , easy ! ) the straps came attached chair it seems secure easy clean there nooks crannies ! the tray lid , pretty cool you actually take food tray , put lid , put refrigerator ! ( cool ! ) my 18 lb 7 month old seems like chair plus , price nice ! the first years deluxe seat not easy put together i refer directions it took good 20 minutes the directions bit confusing ( i like think i 'm pretty smart ! ) the straps threaded little holes chair attach they n't seem secure a small child could easily remove , maybe even toddler after together , seemed like going ok it secured chair seems pretty easy clean ( not easy fisher-price chair ) it recline , n't feature i need son sits well wo n't lay back chair he seems comfy chair it 5 point harness , i felt like bit overkill i n't plan leaving chair unsupervised for use , fisher price chair much better deal it easier put together clean features i like 
-1	i got chair boy month old i n't try right away look cheap way much plastic exposed i started putting baby 3 months old chair horrible back completely flat lets baby slide side side , cover way thin not even soft enough let baby sit minutes the sliding cheap cover turned not even worst part baby began eating solids chair even worse since straps hanging baby prefers eat instead food ! i wish n't throw box right away i would 've retuned 
-1	the opening little small 's hard 3 year old pee without peeing pee guard plus , would put ridges pee guard ? it makes much harder clean sanitize my 3 year old 50-75th percentile height weight , 's not huge kid i feel seat made small average 3 year old i n't think i 'd recommend others 
-1	the main reason buying cup disney characters , i say 's really hard drink you keep sucking sucking nothing comes not recommended especially little one still transitioning bottle 
-1	i wish i read reviews these frustratingly impossible open i hate throwing away 
-1	they cute looking bottles not spill poor little girl could not get milk ! would not recommend ! 
-1	i read reviews greatly anticipating receiving freddie upon arrival super cute i began assembly thing ( opinion already come assembled ) -- -you needed micro phillips screwdriver get insert batteries -- -a huge pain the worst however , amazingly inadequate stand comes freddie -- -it horrible insufficient weight mobile makes whole thing look extremely cheap assembled i bought originally thinking would quality product , yet another baby product well overpriced , marketed really awful quality turn away seek something else 
-1	the product works described 're going need least 2 toy short for example , i attached toy high chair one strap toy could n't even reach across tray 
-1	not sure used inserts i not impressed petite baby leaked time they floating around house burp cloths clean mess i not thrilled diapers either 
-1	basically get pay these really thin not absorbent , i ca n't really use anything maybe wiping baby 's face spit 
-1	the first time i tried squirting water use wipe daughter water beaded rolled right wipe horrible ! they & # 34 ; rags & # 34 ; rag bag n't work wipes n't absorb water : ( 
-1	wipes small , not absorbent , ripped 1st wash , i actually using vivo paper towel , works much better 
-1	i guess get pay these work alright started tearing wash second wash i previously bought osocozy wipes using year ( look exactly ) almost none torn frequent washing ( i use diaper wipes ) i would never buy brand would pay double osocozy wo n't fall apart immediately my mistake ! 
-1	these wipes soft , absorbent , perfectly sized but beautiful rainbow colored threading began unravel first wash so 're getting lovely color , think twice without threads , probably get cheaper flannel wipe good too bad i would bought 
-1	bought cheaper alternative , i disappointed they rough , not absorbent , edges unravel first wash and yes , i not use fabric softener dryer , 's not completely water repellent good thing though : i contacted company website , asking special instructions first use all told i n't use fabric softener sheets and send brand new package free they still water repellent 5 washes absorbency actually improves quiet bit it 's hassle i 'd rather spent money osocozy organic unbleached flannel wipes they cost much better quality work right away 
-1	very thin flimsy like paper even wet i not recommend baby 
-1	returning item immediately very small slips wood table , formica countertop , high chair tray pretty much use i see older child 's small snack plate , possibly one clip high chairs , arms keep place otherwise useless also : packaging really bent shape , would n't gifting quality ( think fun toys seller ) and , thing n't unroll flat box i dont ' know long would take flatten , since 're returning day 1 
-1	after couple weeks use rubber mat makes majority outward facing surface mat started pill fall wherever child kicked pressed foot now , couple months , 's even worn holes way rubber mat underlying nylon two spots feet hit i gave two stars instead one fit seats ( 07 , 4runner ) well technically protected however made mat entirely thick nylon fabric would far superior presumably less expensive 
-1	n't fit car ( volvo ) i rig tape kind work should returned i opened install 
-1	it 's not i n't like mirror , i like big design however not fit 2012 nissan altima my infant 's car seat behind passenger seat i attach mirror headrest , n't show child it high i tried everything connecting bottom hooks car seat try pull attaching dangerously loose around head rest still not hang low enough angle i see going the image i get top car seat unfortunately i returning item trying find new one 
-1	i guess get pay i though like canvas-type carter 's tote friend , one much smaller inside the outer material ok - looked easy wipe clean - inside material cheaply made , one large pocket ( one large enough diapers , although large hold diapers neatly ) closure , 2 net pockets n't big enough diapers ( must meant bottles ) i purchased looked like friend 's , outside pockets go way around - n't one - back one big pocket - not i looking the inside also fairly small this one going back 
-1	inconsistent readings not user friendly impossible get accurate reading , especially small , squirming forehead purchased something else instead 
-1	we 've used highchair months the design concept great however high chair not fit traditional style tables well fabric looks gross cereal mashed if table table skirt , point baby 's legs run grow i think would work okay babies 9mon+ table not skirts , not seem secure difficult get baby & 
-1	this chair amazing many ways i instead high chair amazing son table instead separate high chair it well-designed , nice look , works perfectly i going tohowever , i two problems one , pins need press release metal arms disassembly hard press i n't nails i fairly strong , hard time fingers second , one snaps chair cover detached first time i unsnapped the bottom ( recieving ) part came completely fabric , 's way snap given two snaps either side holding child seat , seat unusable i 'll update review i response inglesina usa defective cover it 5 stars provide good customer service , one star n't given quickly chair broke 
-1	we 8 months old baby stroller offering pretty big space playing , sleeping ( age ) very well done , pretty strong stroller , nice canopy , easy take 3 wheels , easy fold , nice use big city ( chicago ) 2 stars small storage space , not easy unfold , takes lot space trunk , wheels hard wife co carry , i not found space house put , since not staying unsupported ( like wall ) 
-1	my 2 month old able wiggle arms bottom top every night material stretchy not good job holding arms one time wiggled arms bottom opening , small velcro tabs got pushed chin/jaw line since bringing hands face got scratched pretty badly turning head side side rubbing rough velcro ! i wish i could upload picture ! not happy mom i saw morning ! ! 
-1	this big newborn , baby 6 lbs not swaddles appropriately furthermore , washing , velcro sticks one another , i believe one sides sewn opposite side , making unable ot stick one arm middle very weird design use blanket , 's better way swaddle 
-1	these supposed fit sizes 7-14 pounds my twins 10 pounds swaddles already n't fit spend little go halo swaddle sleep sacks work well , also offer option swaddling arms arms the halos also flexible baby grows , velcro closures stuck anywhere sack but buy halo , buy cotton , not fleece , unless live cold place keep home cool we found cotton works well , even cold nights 
-1	i bought thinking great idea i never heard woombie though first zip swaddler i bought i noticed son could get hands top though seemed wiggle around lot always trying stretch legs feet bottom then i saw woombie amazon even though cost i decided try instead i soo happy i ! the woombie snug ca n't get hands top they also longer room wiggle feet the woombie soo much better , i wish i never wasted money ! these would work well short chubby baby though , want baby able suck fingers 
-1	i not care looked like straight jacket babies when i put baby went ballistic i unwrapped back old fashion way 
-1	i high hopes product - 's super easy swaddle baby product compared swaddle blankets , son ( 6 5 pounds ) able get arm top every time 
-1	i realize babies like & # 34 ; swaddled & # 34 ; , absolutely ridiculous at 18 inches 5 pounds 7 oz , torture device made little girl look needed strapped dolly wheeled like hannibal lector after 20 minutes torture constricting device finally took returned 's junk babies n't want get maybe others not much 
-1	we received several swaddleme wraps ( loved new-newborn , not 10+ lbs ) , i thought would even better/faster way get night newborn unfortunately , baby able easily wriggle fits neck hole frustrated woke even more might work , i 'd skip favor swaddleme 's plain blanket tight swaddle technique ! 
-1	i thought product would great , cheaper alternative woombie i wrong this product not strong enough 9 pound baby she could easily get hands top swaddle pod i suggest spending extra money get woombie unless course baby not super active hands 
-1	i bought i planning home birth realized initial footprint n't taken like hospital , i really wanted first footprint i liked inkless came paper , call deluxe complete overstatement the paper nothing thick printing paper inkless wipes left footprint paper - like inkless blots i followed instructions result messy , ink-like footprint paper the saving grace inky feet clean afterward - simple wipe wet cloth trick ( though , i 'd highly recommend thorough hand wash handprints ) there products like far less i 'd equally `` happy '' would not recommend product 
-1	i thought fit standard dr browns not returning opening wide overall bulkier anticipated 
-1	i liked idea behind n't work us the bottle holder collapsed around bottle daughter n't know 
-1	it never stays closed , n't contain many bags the bags surprisingly large thick , much bigger i need one dirty diaper dirty outfit i n't understand n't able put decent clasp dispenser keep shut we tape closed , n't look great when 's time refills , 'll probably get different dispenser another company 
-1	it wo n't stay shut total pain i actually bough cheapo dog poop bags dispensers work better 
-1	it 's bulky gets caught everything even i picket , makes clip redundant as clip does n't keep container it 's constantly coming last not least , bag container latch never stays closed it 's very annoying i n't use anymore 
-1	the material used not strong sturdy within days use , dispenser wont lock would open rolling diaper refill bags not recommended do n't go cheap 
-1	i bought lid however i find lid hard put , little tab / hole one i recieved seem tight made lid useless i also prefer ones handle sides sometimes i 'm wrangling toddler snack helps hold sides leaving one hold snack i get one hand coat , etc going back brands 
-1	these bottles ok , really n't anything reduce colic , nipples left blisters baby 's upper lip i really like drop-in concept , not work us i sold ebay uses 
-1	my mom bought baby shower gift i started using immediately i 've used approx 5 months ( baby 3 months ) it used almost daily buuuut zippers already ripping bag ( always fuss ) side zipper always gets stuck lining i would not recommend bag ( especially price ) so cheaply made 
-1	the 2013 model defective the crotch strap short apparently causes problems many children mine when happens , need pay additional $ 5 plus $ 5 shipping get replacement part , happen stock next year 's model longer crotch strap it 's frustrating spend much money car seat repeatedly call customer service line one staffs pay money fix seat defects ( sorry not defects would pay , clek calls improvement making models ) before i huge fan seat way company chose handle clear product design problem means i 'll never business 
-1	i got mobile thinking would good twins ' tummy time also crib mobile it 's hard use tummy time girls kept scooting forward bonking heads then i put crib - according instructions - fell - twice ! i think plastic strap secures stretches hole hook becomes big i returning hits one kids head i 'll order another fisher price precious planet mobile , i love 
-1	the gate stops effective we purchased keep kids kitchen husband keeps tripping , cant figure latch our four year old niece pushes pops open , wore latch , our toddler however figured push hard enough pop open it sorta works modification , i sure make due it got 2 supposed last longer 
-1	it broken arrived i excited get help protect kids but arrived broken i return 
-1	the product packaging says gate 31 & # 34 ; high isnt it 28 5 & # 34 ; if stairs like distance top bottom mountable point banister 28 5 & # 34 ; , obviously not work had return disappointed 
-1	i 'm shocked positive reviews ! 1 ) it u shaped n't stay well if baby touches , 'll take right 2 ) it wo n't charge case it cut large charging stand 3 ) ordered black , got pink in short , n't anything well 
-1	i love idea mini-diaper bag instances n't want lug around full-size bag unfortunately , brica version skinny actually function diaper bag the diaper pad takes entire width length thing anything add needs skinny otherwise velcro wo n't close adding two size 5 diapers already causes brica start bulging uncomfortably this leaves hardly room wipes you need slim container near empty package wipes there good chance need pack stuff separately defeats purpose not full-size diaper bag i give credit brica good build quality the materials attractive seem durable the integrated bag holder nice touch an integrated wipe holder would much valuable though 
-1	i hoping something slim i could fit purse son older i n't need full diaper bag i standard size hobo purse way big fo rit i liked compartments design bulky i looking i returned 
-1	i 2011 ford edge not work roll window shade properly installed , gets caught currently baby 3 months , wo n't rolling window back anytime soon , still i n't tried another one ca n't give another recommendation unfortunatly 
-1	i 've tried , not see-through driver 's seat ( posing safety problem ) , edges n't stick glass stretched in particular , hard-plastic guide bottom warped also , size shade unfortunately square seen car square windows ? most windows wider replaced jeep cling sunshade i 'm happy 
-1	we 've done lug car seat airport routine times 's not fun task so i intrigued concept car seat travel tote this tote brica gives ability carry tote back pack pull behind since wheels in opinion , way use tote pulling behind utilizing wheels wearing backpack awkward uncomfortable the straps set close together i not imagine anyone carrying bag comfortably i smaller frame even i found difficult get straps shoulders i question whether not seats fit bag the britax marathon 70 snug fit the britax roundabout classic 55 forced bag even not close zipper the bag boast rather generous storage pocket you could easily toss lots baby essentials storage area personally , i think travel tote non-essential item actually using child 's car seat plane i suppose 're gate checking seat might importance 
-1	not `` shade '' barely block sun ( baby still blinded time sun comes car window ) move suction cups prepared never stick again apparently one time deal they stuck great first , i needed reposition one suction cups , not stick , matter i cleaned window suction cup , keeps falling baby 's face terrible product 
-1	this product terrible- i would not recommend it we bought use back windshield , help poor 4 month old son not sun eyes 1/2 hour morning drive 1 ) we small ( old style honda civic ) car when stretched largest size , blocked tiny portion sun i ca n't imagine ridiculous would larger vehicle 2 ) more importantly , 20 minute drive pull 4 times re-suction window we almost ended soaked passenger seat thing sounds like gunshot flies window 3 ) we tried suctioning without stretching whole way , without stretching , n't make difference , still n't stay put all said , got money back 
-1	i purchased item go back window nissan versa , small car my husband try put suction cups wo n't stay , stretches fit , not cover back window , defeats purpose thank amazon refunding us purchase i constantly impressed impeccable customer service 
-1	maybe works better smaller cars n't stretch much ( least 's i 'm guessing lot favorable reviews state cars ) , definitely n't work larger suv windows i followed instructions , cleaned window suction cups , n't seem work i loved idea stretching fit larger windows vehicle , n't even come close 
-1	i actually ( stupidly ) bought second one , thinking perhaps i mis-treated first one ( twisting knobs , fact not 'knobs ' despite look , rather buttons apparently twisting cause suction cups malfunction well , i carefully pushed knob/buttons one guess ? it still falls all the time it soooo aggravating returning and wishing i learned lesson first one ! 
-1	purchased prius it worked really great stopped working not really sure happened , hot day maybe something we kept trying put back minutes would fall 
-1	out package , sun shade looks awesome it appears well crafted , good materials the mesh wonderfully stretchy strong , snap along edge allows cinch short side rear window better fit great idea unfortunately , like reviewers , i quickly discovered suction cups total junk i bought two shades put rear windows within week , one shades started fall window two places i reattached suction cups ; held 30 seconds popping after reading reviews ( i n't buying ; lesson learned ! ) , i looked closer suction cups - sure enough , i saw hairline crack underside one , rendering incapable holding suction they never worked within three weeks installation shade exact thing wish 'd address design suction cups , could great product , 're total junk complete waste money 
-1	do not buy sunshade , not work the concept wonderful manufactured poorly if stretch four corners car window , bows top bottom sun shines right child 's face you would need double cover window trust poor reviews product not buy 
-1	i purchased product slim pickings target i think someone used returned , n't neatly packed box i think idea wonderful , suction cups heavy end dangling rear window within minutes ! i honda accord , n't think angle vehicle much different standard sedans so , i would not recommend product anyone , end dangling distraction rear view mirror driving 
-1	this screen worked week sudden stopped sticking i 've tried cleaning windows , cleaning suction cups , wetting suction cups , i put 2 different windows i stretching big window loose small window still falls worst product ever 
-1	i thought would perfect misshapen windows it first - far fit it easily covered passenger windows days it slowly pulled together square barely 8x8 inches i switched back sun shades hospital gave us free ! and sun protection ? ? nada none what ? who thinks blocking sun the bare window blocks sun product this potential unfortunate miss 
-1	worst product ever this window shade not stay i finally threw mine trash i would returned thrown away packaging do n't waste time we ended buying different brica shade actually works i not recommend product 
-1	our tiles virtually texture basket not hold place even 's empty i really disappointed 
-1	this basket n't stay tile empty , let alone foam toys we regular smooth ceramic tile we tried cleaning tile , wetting back suction cups , putting dry etc i wish i n't thrown away box i really dislike basket ca n't return a total waste money 
-1	the suctions not work it falls matter try stick tub i returned product 
-1	i really wanted basket work , kept falling bath i returned immediately

-1	i purchased seat march 2013 husband 's vehicle , 1999 ford explorer we n't want spend much money 'd spent britax marathon 70 installed car , positive reviews i saw encouraging my disdain seat developed quickly because husband 's vehicle n't latch , needed seat belt install , even though seat belt locks , locking retractor causes seat tip one side that n't unsafe , drove nuts putting son seat trying get harness secure i also found seat got loose time i finally used locking clip stop tipping , better job keeping seat tightly installed upright this minor annoyance , however my biggest complaint harness straps : twist , easily this caused vehicle 's seat belt pushing harness straps along belt path the harness one continuous loop , 's easy sides become uneven it 's rethread harness , n't huge problem seat installed rear-facing , vehicle , would really annoying installed forward facing you careful rethreading harness ; first time i put son i tightened harness one straps came completely splitter plate my husband growing impatient continuous fussing seat , proper use important 's darn near impossible tribute , least vehicle as , seat short shell - full inch less britax seat our son 10-15th percentile height 18 month check-up ; 's hit growth spurt average the short shell means running room rear facing seat , something i not expect i bought year ago he 's not yet two , i hoped keep rear facing longer so , given hatred seat fact wo n't work us much longer , replaced graco headwise 70 husband 's vehicle i installed tribute parents ' car latch , slightly easier for ease installation , britax hands winner ; headwise husband 's vehicle ( even seatbelt ) close second i n't many positive things say evenflo tribute it light , even though 's not well padded , son always seemed comfortable that 's i think 
-1	we bought three car seats use three different vehicles -- two minivans small sedan it worked fine one minivans , n't able use two vehicles the problem : when using rear-facing position , seat pivot backwards point belt slides back seat the seat would re-tightened re-leveled every use , would often tip daughter backwards unsafe angle use it 's also difficult install 's level indicator -- instructions say line level indicator mark side seat learn lesson buy higher-quality seat avoid waste

-1	this product annoyed moment i took box assembly horrible , & # 34 ; bassinet & # 34 ; ( ha ha ) pointless they everything wrong assembly , sturdiness , portability , even bag junk we bough product , bough bassinet poor purchasing decision part 
-1	i 7 months now i thought i could deal model then self-feeding entered picture here 's skinny : put removable pink tray dishwasher you ca n't throw rest tray metal screws -- fact fills water ( desperate -- i took day drain/dry ) if thinking fabric cover throw , think the main seating parts/fabric riveted onto frame this prevents cleaning no matter hard i tried wipe , straps mashed food ground every meal i finally got frustrated i took apart ( literally cutting frame ) i threw parts washer i going purchase industrial velcro put pieces back , , realized time i i could put money towards nicer model i ended purchasing eddie bauer model $ 100 i t-totally wipe clean and/or wash the pros - really folds nicely when clean looks pretty 
-1	i excited gate , arrived , large standard 36 & # 34 ; door i looked online realized dimensions listed product ( interestingly similar gate available list dimensions , i see since 's called & # 34 ; wide & # 34 ; maybe would imply 's exclusively wide doors , not normal and wide doors ! ) so , fyi - doors & # 62 ; 38 & # 34 ;

-1	much 's supposed babies 4months - walking baby 5 months much stuff couldnt reach dangly toys seat hard rotate ( shes 50 % perc 's not tiny baby ) think 's much stuff baby young maybe 9-10 month old also baby isnt 'jumper ' wouldnt bother type contraption advise - wait till baby 6 7 months old 
-1	this diaper great design cute prints , i think quality inferior grovia bumgenius a minor issue pul n't feel nice quality ( expensive product ) i also wish stretchy the major major major issue rise snaps kept popping open my son small middle settings , rise opened wearing i could see clear crotch diaper this demonstrates poor quality control i heard others encountering similar issues i also found snaps small hard fasten compared grovia , bumgenius , thirsties , best bottom etc hopefully future blueberry resolve issues ! 
-1	my biggest complaint product washing , take long time dry the material holds liquid thick section made natural fiber , encased synthetic fiber i turn part pant inside help dry faster , still , normal load drying , n't completely dry my secondary complaint good job absorbing baby n't feel wet i 've tried blueberry training pants plain underwear better luck options this grovia trainer well made i agree reviewers bit trim -- child small 20 months using feels perfect size-wise unfortunately n't performing i need , i ca n't recommend 
-1	my little one potty trained except night time this small she 30 lbs weight limit 51 we could barely get hips there also n't much room insert 2 5 year old quite bladder , would better left underpants ( urine everywhere ) i not recommend overnight training pros : cutelooks nicewashabledurablecons : smalldoes not look feel like underweartakes long dryelastic not stretchy 
-1	wanted love use grovia cloth diapers mix however , vendor sent wrong item instead did n't reorder i afraid would happen since things mislabeled wrong items packaging i ordered charlie banana trainers/swim diapers instead 
-1	i love set go store every time i tried ordering amazon , tray came broken it must shipping process frustrating i would recommend going store buy checking see tray broken first 
-1	this good starting but i started pumping became impractical i recommend lansinoh bags instead 
-1	these awful smell i decided return i n't want baby breathing every night 
-1	i used decals many times , many different companies really lucky i guess i love skip hop products , decals n't stay wall : ( overall still looks adorable , get two whole trees ( really 4 half trees leaves stuff please ) , i saddened immediate peeling , especially since i 'm practiced pretty careful it 's definitely not tacky brands luckily daughter sees smoothing constantly instead wanting rip , mimics smooths i doubt last long though ! : ) 
-1	i ordered wall decals soon released skip hop they really cute , look nice bedding however , fatal flaw- n't stick walls wall , even applying first time ( moreso move decals ) this product is a choking/suffocation hazard to your baby ! the decals easily fall wall ! i 've several leaves completely fall wall crib , owls n't stick , branches n't stick i 'm extremely disappointed poor adhesive quality compared decals i 've used walls too bad skip hop skimped quality- really bad call part 
-1	i bought waterproof bibs 6-mo old started eating solids during first times using bibs , seems hold well washing , 's month use bibs n't hold well anymore aside , i 've washed bibs many times every time i wash , water turns blue i feel not safe son like chew bibs i not recommend ! i go back skip hop waterproof bibs - much better quality least colors n't bleed ! 
-1	this nice idea 's cute , far i not able get stick anything seconds kinda defeats purpose grabby toddler yank whole thing right spill everything onto table/floor 
-1	the fork useless daughter chewed end ( white part ) teethmarks stayed the white part soft even take fingernail make mark 
-1	i bought teach son use silverware harder use real stuff the fork useless spoon good unfortunately , son wo n't use uses everyday silverware made nervous learned couple days n't hurt for us , waist money 
-1	in summary , job long 's not broken that said , timer turn knob broke 2 months the warmer comes 1yr warranty however need mail determine nature damage their customer service said would take 1 month receive replacement , decide manufacturing issue they not provide parts ( i would happy receive new knob ) another lesser issue small volume water reservoir while theory works fine , ever experienced getting every 3 hours night 2-3 months barely keeping eyes open , little annoying need figure 's enough water heating ( it 's not easy tell since plastic light blue water clear ) finally , want end heating , need unplug thee 's stop button turn knob back 0 it job 's not good value near $ 30 
-1	i tried like i n't i ended returning replacing dr brown 's i 'm much happier 
-1	i received shower gift it shuts timer finished wo n't go back hours even unplugged plugged back i n't think water tank big deal work , heated ok we n't use i wish could return

-1	its lot take apart clean leaks top my child may like dora cup not worth money 
-1	nope cup good side not allows spills happen comes time disassemble throw dishwasher pain even painful trying put together , nope not worth , one went straight trash , i n't time deal complicated spill proof cup , two stars cute 's pretty much

-1	these n't anything help smell child 's diaper pail ! ! another problem not stay attached clip complete waste money ! ! 
-1	the brackets not work , air fresheners wonderful the problem fresheners fall brackets i put inside lid kitchen trash diaper pail fell movement lid they fall trash/diapers not place reaching hands bummer since good idea needs tighter fit again review applies bracket function , 5 stars fresheners 
-1	the product fine i ordered particular set brackets i wanted stick lid diaper pail our pail really kitchen trash pail n't place deodorant disks the adhesive brackets pretty weak so fell opening closings lid 
-1	just bought target first , air freshener not stay clip , falls right second , fragrance n't strong enough make difference right i sitting top diaper pail , see i smell ( i put inside pail & fell ) i smell nothing these going back store 
-1	we ( daughter ) high hopes airhead penguin -- promise endless stream bubbles the munchkin bath fun crushed hope the wands spin penguin blows stream air , bubbles pop sides penguin 's mouth , making mess , bubbles we tried changing bubble fluid ( homemade two store brands ) result i try tape fix recommended comments , waste time money 
-1	i bought product retail store excited use bc daughter loves bubbles like everyone else said n't work bc bubbles pop leaving mouth i going return , tossed box xmas n't feel like going hassle store anyway , i looking reviews tape works great u tape half hole would i buy product anyone , absolutely not bc 's crap but already purchased , i wanted work i n't feel like i threw away $ 20 so n't buy product , u already purchased , modified work update : do not buy product never worked the modifications temporary eventually not work anymore it trash 
-1	this thing worked first time tried i came back bathtime 2 nights later nothing wo n't turn i feel bad chuck huge piece plastic garbage one time use $ 12 ridiculous 
-1	i really , really wanted product work even though i knew large bubbles delighting boy marketing materials fake , i n't mind , well , i expected smaller bubbles floating bath tub what i got tiny bubbles immediately popped soon appeared - still attached blower my son intrigued noise machine , i n't think even noticed baby bubbles constantly dying yellow wands i tried newer batteries , thinking product needed speed this change rate wands turned , nothing ever made single bubble escape penguin huge disappointment in case missed , reviewers found ways make work taping part affect air flow something if willing rig work , i recommend searching reviews i not try - despite awesome concept - i decided i n't spend $ 15 broken product i fix 99 cent bubbles turned entertain son fine 
-1	as another reviewer said , works great put tape left half air valve 2 stars n't put tape so 're like , n't even test could return , tape best option 
-1	so why flawed , non-working product still market ? munchkin really good items , crap this falling latter category strange n't done complete redesign product returns mine definitely going back i n't give son disappointing , crappy , non-working toys it 's bubble blower i n't blow bubbles , i n't even care reason fact n't one thing marketed or anything else , matter 
-1	such cheap item the projector went within month we still use lullaby music buy night light separately huge disappointment 
-1	the different sound choices good , projector stopped working couple months , pushing projector button resets sound 
-1	this sound machine lovely white noise baby needs sleep , beautiful turning light pictures projected ceiling so 2 months motor burned stopped moving projection , immediately purchased another one ( first gift amazon , second babies r us ) and , within 2 weeks , same thing happened we even ran projections night after reading machines , seems common problem very disappointed 
-1	like posters mentioned , projector stopped working for us , 2 months almost nightly use prior , marginally happy munchkin nursery projector the sounds low-quality , extremely short clips ; white noise clip short enough creates obvious beat pattern ( thus fails really white noise ) the one cool thing projector auto-on mode come detects baby 's cry it really works n't ever turned noise daughter 's crying that earned extra star lastly , despite amazon 's 90 return window , amazon not accept return , `` known issue '' 're supposed contact manufacturer a known issue still sell wo n't take back ? that 's not cool especially manufacturer 's customer service seems slow replying email inquiries i guess phone call required 
-1	update : we loved product projector stopped working ! i hoping would last 5 months : ( i read reviews thought fluke people said projector broke not fluke ugh ! my husband i pleased product baby loves ! the voice activation sensitive leave time night otherwise turns timer set turns back seconds ( i think picks sound fan room ) great product ! 
-1	this nice product , not expensive good but baby never interested i use night light bit low rely diaper changing example the sounds nice images projected seem nice not capture baby 's attention at all and 'm talking curious baby 
-1	i thought nursery projector bee 's knees randomly stopped working 3 months it n't sounds , projector no light at time , baby infant , never dropped damaged way i emailed customer service , gladly said would replace item since still warranty i bought second one , i would still sound machine i mailing one ( i n't know avoid ) munchkin also said i would pay ship it cost $ 10 they send & # 34 ; gift & # 34 ; make shipping cost , stroller cup holder neat idea , n't fit any strollers it seems think stroller handles thin i 'm guessing chose gift poor seller ? it took get new one , i receive on second one , projector part stopped rotating month i 'm not paying $ 10 ship the one i bought also projector part break soon after basically , things really neat concept , obviously poor quality too bad munchkin n't charge us $ 5- $ 10 use quality parts last ? ? ? 
-1	i loved product , worked after months , projection ceiling stopped working another month later noise started making weird sounds so i got maybe 3 5 months use not worth money short period 
-1	i ordered product twice sent back twice needless say , i ordering different one the first one would randomly come full volume - sound , lights everything this different voice activation feature supposed come last features set after i returned one , replacement i received projector n't spin i not check see issue one returning according reviews , non-spinning projector common problem people experienced both returns easy 
-1	this good product plan leaving whitenoise night want expensive night light however auto feature leaves something desired we mostly use nightlight occasionally use projector pros : *nice nightlight cool color*projection help keep child 's interest*multiple projections interesting cons : *auto turns device immediately sound level turned slightest sound this mean small murmur child passing car results sound louder noise light int room wakes disrupt child 
-1	it worked great baby enjoyed lot then 6 1/2 weeks , projector stopped rotating i able exchange store i got , i 'm quite disappointed n't last long stopped working properly we 'll see long new one last i 'll give second chance , breaks us , i 'll look another brand update : ( june 10 , 2014 ) 4 weeks later , projector stopped rotating ! what piece junk ! wo n't bother exchanging 3rd one i 'll look another brand ! 
-1	my son given gift two months old he slept bassinet pack play bedroom first nine months due breathing problems because unit used sporadically first seven months when son finally started sleeping crib i would turn white noise projector the white noise kept night i turned projector hour after couple months projector lights longer rotates my son , almost 15 months old asks projector every night i 've decided instead buying new one ( probably stop working shirt months ) i 'm getting glow dark stars creating mobile hang ceiling 
-1	updated january 3 , 2014 i received new one one wo n't stay shut turns runs great , turn sound projection , come back within 10 seconds so , i sent back amazon ( thank , amazon amazingly quick turn around replacement ! ) the replacement arrived today thing turns back 10 seconds even shuts timer new review : i 've purchased 3 4 son loves jungle projection the projection always first crap i received new one today guess ? this one wo n't turn i got set turned got positioned went turn turned 5 seconds later came back now way get stay unplug , means i reset sound time seriously ? these projection sounds machines ( munchkin one soundspa one ) junk junk save money do n't purchase ! original review : got months ago loved however , started shorting if turn noise projection , whole thing turns and get , projection n't turn grr 
-1	i really loved product , unfortunately quality n't good the first time bought , projector stopped working within months we would push button turn projector whole thing would shut we contacted amazon issue sent us replacement we received replacement within month half , projector stopped rotating had i reviewed product initially , i would given 5 stars , however , going two broken within couple months use , i rate one 2

-1	my son never liked pacifiers he bottle fed reason , i thought might take he n't use way i placed mouth , took munched sides it n't occupy long all babies different , i suppose little one prefers chew sticks , plastic , & hard solid objects it 's great idea , n't work 
-1	when discovered product last year son born thought would bases covered not like it could never used pacifier shape wont stand all he using zo-li molars freely manipulate loves it see review product 
-1	it 's uncomfortable not big enough cover baby i wish little wider 
-1	it fell apart 1 wash delicate cycle per manufacturer 's recommendation i also n't dry per instructions i took washer seam completely ripped open zipper meets fabric i would never use something without washing first using infant , i 'm not sure boppy would make product ca n't handle simple wash delicate cycle would not recommend 
-1	thought i 'd traveling , even i i n't bring along there many straps , liner it gets way it 's trouble 's worth even 're single mom like i , need pack mule it 's not hard take regular boppy pillow around shoulder , even attached hip , 're carrying car seat baby inside , diaper bag , groceries , miscellaneous items 
-1	this actual pillow zippers make fold somehow it not really convenient traveling ! super bulky ! if thinking going airplane forget carry personal item this not convenient ! i returned got breastfriend inflatable pillow instead works like charm ! 
-1	unless less 6 pound baby useless my son 8 lbs 14 oz birth could never use insert it waste money late return 
-1	sadly little baby hated ( 4 months old ) the minute set , screamed relentlessly pressure cushion put head this go promptly returned

-1	eww i followed instructions tag , wrung much possible time hung air dry overnight i even washed several times a months using , i started notice little green/brown specks bottom white part i thought awhile brown fabric coming pilling wash , specks started multiply appear yellow petals it getting moldy ! ewwwwwww i frustrated disgusted product it 's not like i left balled wet anything horrible waste money if one , make sure check often signs mold 
-1	it soft cosy , but- gets cold ends ( full od water ) - heavy full water bath , impossible wash , i need drag washing mashing time- better dipper sink 
-1	if i could give product 0 stars , i would reason i called blooming bath customer service today product information i used bath 3 times , reading package made polyurethane foam , i wondered flame retardants used foam lo behold , foam contains toxic potentially harmful flame retardants , not mentioned anywhere site feeling guilty giving baby virtually chemical bath , i tossed away immediately purchased non-toxic boon naked bath blooming bath not worth money people need know product is treated chemical flame retardants 
-1	this soft , flexible , fits perfectly hard plastic tub i babies r us my five month old seemed comfortable - much better sitting plastic ! especially slides around plastic , cushion keeps place without struggling a major drawback though when wet , heavy and bulky hard wring it heavy i could n't hang shower rod big suction hook shower the bedtime ritual complicated enough without slowly wring petal the instructions say fold petals center press - i 'll try tomorrow , i n't see could possibly remove enough water i 'd never put something wet dryer , besides fact i refuse drag dripping bathroom dryer every night i 'm sad super comfy way bathe baby but 's impractical the last thing i need another piece high-maintenance baby gear if anyone suggestions drying ( short steamroller ) , please let know 
-1	not color wrong , n't even right brand gate i oredered kidco gate could used kidco extension , i opening 63 & # 34 ; wide , i got one made north states the gate & # 34 ; matte bronze & # 34 ; honestly pretty much looks black , extension not matte , makes two pieces not match the extension wo n't even work gate i got you would expect ordering kidco would get kidco gate , n't count ! 
-1	very cheap construction the important elements ( attaches gate door ) cheap plastic the bolts attach gate wall heavy duty , 's point connects plastic ? ? returning

-1	i saw reviews got really excited my son needed fresh sippy cups daycare i figured price one win 4 1/2 stars , i n't even bother read took package tried open ; go i 'm thinking maybe i 'm getting carpal tunnel , i passed husband open after 4 minutes pride got best i opened another type munchkin sippy i bought problem , click lock technology , problem i tried failed , i walked away thinking maybe i 'm lacking nutrition , i tried dinner luck re-evaluating leftie loosie , righty tighty , still nothing started writing review since i seem one problem far gave sippy one elbow tremor last squeeze opened i got excited closed open guess , 's locked $ % # k ! 
-1	we previous iteration product really loved but , updated version tendency leak they messy us we wo n't getting 
-1	it sounds like good cup theory , practice , son work much drink water gave day , not touched bottle ever since 
-1	just bought product us web site , finally found original china , joking ! 
-1	i like actual bottle -- 's glass , n't incredibly heavy but really annoys spouts make bottles trainer cup expensive difficult find i also still ca n't find handles if born free really wanted make environmentally way parents use glass bottles sippy cups later , would spouts handles easily available reasonably priced i n't recommend purchasing unless want use bottles i 'm nearing end bottle feeding , hoping conversion would justify trying bottles 
-1	i really wanted like bottles , problems leaking it n't matter bottle tight put lid , leaked every time stopped using we rarely use bottles anyway , use the2 piece wide glass baby bottles silicone grips set 
-1	i willing give fair shake who beat price point ? medela certainly can't however , not adhere skin easily aforementioned competitor they keep coming feeds , grew quickly frustrating baby i went back brand pity , seemed good theory , i like carry case but essentially 'll paying $ 5 carry case 
-1	the diameter right , 's way tooooo long ! do n't understand design like you nipples high 6 cm use or i get wrong ? 
-1	this nipple shield extremely large , i would consider medium size the baby difficulty even getting mouth i prefer medela sheild provided better fit 
-1	the medela shields worked much better baby i not sure whether 's shape one , already used medela ( i wanted backup ) 
-1	i bought grandson n't like he likes sophie giraffe green spouts sili paw teether ignores 
-1	i kind disappointed this tubeside seat not efficient seems be not adapted every kind bathtubs 
-1	my rating may little unfair blankets fine - i bought solely i loved adorable sheep pattern when arrived however , print barely discernible it simply looks like blanket i post picture see i 'm talking ( actually shows better picture real life ) i guess 's always possible mine fluke , experience when compared aden anais blankets , i found scratchy , also cheaper this n't issue , i thought i would mention it i love big size blankets , i would given 4 stars i could seen sheep pattern like product image depicted 
-1	buying item bad idea buying bottles bottles aside ; brush good one type bottle stupid opinion 'll need various brushes results counter full extra brushes to buy one baby product functional within brand foolish opinion the lansinoh bottles require brush brush good bottles & # 8230 ; enough said ? 
-1	i lured attractiveness ergonomic design spoon , i bought the green ball spoon 's supposed roll back forth standing upright n't job it tilts forward causes scoop touch whatever surface spoon sitting making matters worse , food slides scoop spoon sitting upright position scoop also shallow food gets everywhere feeding baby this spoon eye candy useful since 's 5 bucks , i n't return denifitely not good buy ! 
-1	it 's cute , not really practical the baby 's hands ca n't really grasp bulb , adults 's nuisance 
-1	these cute design , one pocket front side place could actually catch food the two pocket back bib , serves purpose the one made correctly product picture , i ca n't see 2 know supposed way manufacturing error either way , n't buy ! only one three works 
-1	i bought sippy cups thinking soft nozzle would good transition bottle normal hard-tipped sippy cups , i idea sippy cups would leak when say leak , mean constant stream milk runs bottom lid every time tipped i wouldnt recommend anyone these sippy cups easy 12 month old hold , however leak , i longer use 
-1	these pain adults involved son 's care b/c cup comes apart three pieces washing tight fit ( making nicely spill-proof i 'm sure ) tough disassemble , tough reassemble i 've also noticed deep grooves spout n't like come clean dishwasher , instead collect residue and/or soap stains 
-1	i not recommend cups lids not easy clean cracks importantly i ordered leak proof , however difficult drink cut holes larger i could not even get drink leak 
-1	this cup n't best , i 've worse i like similarly shaped bottles , making holding much easier i also like n't flow quickly like others , since i dont want daughter drink much juice but i hate hard thing clean and leak , not spout side cap closes this taken rotation 1 day 
-1	this thing enormous ! ! way big 9 month old get mouth disappointed ! 
-1	save money , add dollars get safety 1st ones , product bulky , difficult install , directions hard understand , result , going back , lesson learned one 
-1	i love thirsties covers i saw aio i really wanted try despite reviews i ordered 2 much disappointment reviewers correct i used 1 year old daughter leaked maybe would work better smaller baby not bladders big 1 year old i definitely not able use public i change daughters entire outfit everytime goes bathroom i able use home toddling around diaper i check frequently i cant believe wet cover got -- like water proof coating inside cover diaper really disappointed i really wanted love diapers alot people complaining drying time well -- not big issue -- dryer managed dry almost completely little bit dampness remained would dry overnight i 'd leave lay top dryer 
-1	i bought diaper two different brands comparison this least favorite the sewn-in insert not go way front would work ok girl little boy , even pointed , diaper leak i never leave diapers two hours , diaper n't last long it 's best turn inside washing , otherwise 'll never get smell i not sure supposed strip diaper month since not supposed strip covers i not recommend all-in-one diaper i suggest buying pocket diapers 
-1	we usually use flips covers cotton prefolds ( snappi'ed ) n't leak the thirsties leaked 3 times i tried use maybe i sized wrong outside snaps , i ca n't figure use without leaking maybe also 've got skinny baby ( 4th % weight ) thirsties fit chunkier babies better but i n't like 
-1	i high hopes thirsties dipe since i love gussets thirsties covers , boy i wrong i 2 children diapers , 4 month old two year old my two year old actually skinny barely fits ! ! the weight limit 35lbs 24 lbs are factoring urine poo weight perhaps ? ? i also wash diapers every day everything got clean , guess came smelling like ammonia ? ? my thirsts microfiber inserts diaper of-course since polyester yuck ! on lighter note , absorb urine well , not waterproof enough night time heavy wetters this going back diaper pail along thirsties microfiber inserts washed i 'm glad i bought one ! phew ! 
-1	i ordered thinking cover , not one diaper it cloth diaper attached ca n't used separate cloth diapers i n't read description correctly the ones star n't i expecting i returned amazon prompt refunding money love amazon returns ! ! ! 
-1	the velcro not strong cheap son tear easily quickly so child pulls things , avoid use ! ! also , huge on 10 month old 29 inch son , almost covers entire body , feet 
-1	these cups n't last twenty-four hours house my thirteen month old could n't suck single drop so i tried failed i could n't suck drop either cup came two back i took apart tried put back together unless 've got magical power 's nearly impossible it impossible i not imagine people actually use things ! they 're completely worthless 
-1	not really fan cups the flip piece closes straw hard take lid ( neccessary washing ) , straws still leak accidentally turned they better suited older toddlers/kids understand not throw dump cups , otherwise , 'll cleaning messes cursing lid trying take apart time ! 
-1	my daughter loves sip straw i thought perfect inexpensive cup try the problem not spill proof defeats purpose sippy cup the second problem washing i pulled straw i could soak almost impossible put back i feel like cheaply made really not worth buying 
-1	honestly , i ca n't speak well hold time whether leak , used they 're pain put together , n't main problem they ridiculously hard drink my husband i tried get liquid , 's difficult makes drinking unpleasant they 're going go straight trash 
-1	it near impossible suck liquid straws i could barely get anything son definitely could n't the parts near impossible clean well the positive thing i say n't leak n't matter ca n't drink do n't waste time 
-1	these companies really stop marketing cups & # 34 ; leak-proof & # 34 ; i yet find one n't leak my son flips cup pretty steady drip 
-1	i excited i first saw 3 sprouts come hooded towel i really love marketing & designs 3 sprouts products purchased satisfied products past i little hesitant regarding price towels ( $ 30 child 's towel really ? ) , higher price point storage bins worth i figured towels would well so i ordered two - yellow monkey purple hippo incredibly disappointed ! here 's why:1 ) what main purpose towel ? to dry ! these towels n't dry , simply smear water around ! 2 ) the t-shirt material back towel not sewn inner terry-cloth portion therefore makes drying even difficult3 ) for $ 30 towel , n't soft the back t-shirt side , not terry cloth side actually putting baby 's skin it actually pretty rough 4 ) the towels n't wash well the faces pill badly , wrinkle become misshapen the one positive towels nice roomy size i bought daughter almost two worried hood would n't fit head the hoods roomy towel nice wide - wraps around nicely overall , towels incredibly adorable incredibly unusable for price i spent i expecting lot - at least i expecting dry ! ! : ) 
-1	cute , very small plus lined plastic trying avoid plastics harmful chemicals leach atmosphere little one breathe , 's not good

-1	this 5 oz bottle came size 2 nipple way fast flow breastfed son much better bottles 
-1	i got bottle feed normally breastfed 2 month old i work i previously using dr brown 's # 1 nipples the flow nipples fast my baby kept gasping much milk it also little annoying wide mouth ca n't interchange tops bottles i think i 'll stick i already

-1	glad got one i 've fair share sippy cup reviews three little ones i preferred not use wobbly , hard put cap without spilling milk ( handles get way ) also germ infested need pop dome slider covers straw , otherwise mold grows ( even run dishwasher ) there also film milk left behind ( unlike cups ) takes forever dry shape also mold grows weighted base clear cup n't effect use , gross 
-1	i would n't think fragile ! seriously one toss cracked handles straw good , daughter good 10 months 
-1	this not soft it better nothing not nearly comfortable crib mattress we use pack play mattress vacation i feel badly uncomfortable mattress i keep meaning look new one ! 
-1	wow item pits waste money it 's like pillow not mattress my 14 lb baby sank right middle rendering useless i tried carter 's velour cover way small fits pack play piece crap the plastic cover foam/pillow whatever also way big 's inside bad manufacturing start finish save hassle put thick quilt top comes pack play works much better feels like mattress baby uses home 
-1	very hard ! our baby cried fell crib we returned item-definitely not us we not recommend 
-1	update : looks misleading the mattress frame came crib n't lay flat it either tilts one side at first i assumed i inverting frame make sit higher , i flipped frame today still n't lay flat at first , n't big deal , i manually leveled frame however , son heavier ( 16 pounds ) rolling constantly , 's starting tilt mattress face plant bars since well past return date , stuck either drilling wider holes compensate getting another crib not happy i also not feel pine wood sturdy enough withstand enthusiastic toddler wobbles if thinking side-carring crib , forget without fourth side , feels like snap second this beautiful , sturdy , solid wood crib , looks lovely the wood nice , light color , chemical off-gassing smell ! only slight wood oil smell putting together quick easy , although pieces n't labeled , i `` educated guessing '' parts it fairly easy , i set parts i really liked way bolts came prepackaged , question use the two , top side rails slight chip narrowest tips , i think 's inevitable shipping soft wood the mattress useless ; need real one for price , i n't expecting real mattress anyway i 'm docking one star i 'm not happy spring bottom it attaches wooden crib via weird metal arms as another reviewer noted , way get crib set 's highest ( newborn ) level invert metal swing-arms so crib basically balanced 4 , angled arms ( maybe n't want setting crib high , many manufacturer 's pics show way , i think holes drilled ) at rate , 's still not biggest gripe i n't like mattress ( normal levels ) hangs metal arms , 's metal dowel keep extending if 've got thin mattress , toddler stuck hand bouncing , i think could pinched finger waiting happen i 'm crib expert , honestly , maybe 's reason , i think i would rather spring board attach directly frame also , 's minor gripe , crib came covered large manufacturing warning stickers , i wish manufacturer would use glue little easier remove 
-1	it works one year old 's tiny toothbrush my 4 & 7 year old 's brushes slightly bigger ( still kid sizes ) tip holder they always falling i 'm already looking get rid it would work taller/deeper 
-1	i bought molds wonderful experience annabel karmel products unfortunately i disappointed the size pop perfect eighteen month old handle right little one hold my problem base , unnecessarily comes apart four separate molds , breaks really easily mine broke first time i tried pull pop i regret not considered people 's reviews seriously , since many people already experienced issue i thought bad luck , experience i say , 's poor design 's not worth money i 'm disappointed i would recommend people look brands considering one 
-1	i wanted containers carry pre-made food along however , lids not stay i definitely not recommend product ! 
-1	i n't think i 've ever dissatisfied baby product do n't buy the lids not seal , really stack i occasionally use puffs cereal , even risky n't careful totally useless do not bother 
-1	food gets stuck masher part , grooves bottom also , product details say 'imported ' n't list country origin i known made china : ( 
-1	i n't recommend i used mash apples apples came squished intact little juice extracted 
-1	worked food already soft my wife i used briefly decided hassle wash fork would accomplish job 
-1	i purchased product knowing i making baby food , assistance process i loved mashes fruits well , easy serve clean brush i going purchase another one stumbled upon negative reviews i horrified i found made # 7 plastic , health risks poses baby i used two months since stopped will not using crush baby 's food i hope period using baby n't exposed much chemicals contained within cause permanent harm i rather safe use fork spoon crush foods it 's really cute eye-catching though do n't fooled 
-1	pretty much useless mashing foods child loves chew masher ! and likes eat bowl 
-1	as first-time father , i 've opportunity try range different products there ones i love then ones i n't use unfortunately , freshfoods mash & serve bowl falls latter category while concept great , materials simply lacking unless 're mashing already super-soft hard veggies steamed mush , masher n't get far and food want mash already soft , like soft pairs bananas , 's real need mash anyway any potato masher trick , would likely durable , 
-1	at first i loves product i noticed chunks plastic missing inside blender i hope i not feed plastic child the whole thing cracked place leaked counter whenever i used a disappointing product i high hopes 
-1	there 's lot hype days making baby food needing special machine make while i enjoy making different foods little one , i n't think baby food makers necessarily make job easier after testing machine steam food process ( puree chunkier textured food ) food , i came conclusion 's convenient cook food like i normally would run blender mini-processor i think machine takes much space really n't necessary if blender mini-prep already make baby food you n't need pricey machine made making baby food make homemade baby food 
-1	i really hate submit negative review bc product almost but still needs work initially i loved it easy set use , easy clean daughter enjoyed food resulted recipe book the thing i n't care i washed dishwasher ( according instructions ) little food particles would settle bottom main container while n't impair use cause issue food made bc underside , look yucky i n't much success removing even small bottle nipple brush bc way designed i decided deal issue bc i liked convenience using machine not something cooking stove little ones running around but three uses ran snags despite cleaning water reservoir use according manual 's instructions leaving cap reservoir let air uses , i started notice strange odor it smelled like burning second use i thought heating plate breaking motor blender but third use stronger unpleasant it definitely originated reservoir made feel like mold something might since water heated compartment goes main compartment steam food i bit unsure safety baby food i making i resolved call company see might going i could remedy i could even stick dishwasher third use i realized main compartment cracked around attached handle detaching point handle attached bottom one use i might little plastic pieces baby food yuck ! there ended love affair i contacted amazon nicely refunded purchase price i described occurred given odor issues i i unwilling replace it i hope company resolves issues bc really great little tool good price market 
-1	if baby like average baby requires wipes per diaper change i n't recommend full day outing this case n't hold enough wipes if put wipes wipes begin dry also 's hard get 1 single wipe time without correct lid help rip wipes apart i recommend using good zip top bag head store get travel pack wipes carry 
-1	the case difficult open one-handed , pretty important changing diaper it 's not really easy even two hands maybe lots lots use wear little become easier open 
-1	this case poorly made n't really close way it feels like fabric glued cheap plastic box 
-1	for almost 15 dollars i hoping higher quality case could withstand years use stylish looking process what disappointment ! i threw random onto registry mad not reading reviews first i usually the case cheap , cheap plastic not close properly while fabric trim case look cute cheap white plastic tabs open not another issue width product the fabric stuffed padding give squishy feel but means case good half inch thicker conventional wipe cases trivial important not carrying stuff i need i personally n't need excess bulk i actually using wipes container came free diaper changing station instead pricey one this product miss 
-1	i really looking forward cute travel wipe package i disappointed label crooked , n't open close easily i line box get shut it 's not easy retrieve wipes , need easy 're trying change baby often times one hand get wipes ! sadly - i returning item 
-1	the ah goo baby wipes case not good purchase it 's made strikingly flimsy , brittle plastic , despite sporting cute designs , fabric hastily glued makes feel like children 's school project durable case wipes this product cheap wife tried return product amazon , sent message telling keep 'd refund money anyway even amazon n't want back even freebie , 's still not worth i n't see use case product worth recommending do n't waste time money case 
-1	wish i gotten something else pros : lightweightnice colorcons : no recline allpricey actually getflimsy basketsun shield not adequate 
-1	i really wanted love stroller it 's gorgeous i owned 90 days sending back it fine short trip mall nothing else considering price i paid reviews i read ( foolishly after expensive purchase ) i not see reputable upscale baby manufacturer would excited call new improved 2013 model here 2 issues ( would not issues $ 250 00+ stroller ? ? ) the very small canopy- seriously ? ? is skin cancer new confusing medical issue london folks ? because 's issue us even cheap walmart umbrella strollers better canopies i seen similar strollers whole brace tilt foward , i stupidly assumed nope not chance when sitting upright position baby get total maybe 5 inches sun coverage but this not problem ! because call maclaren additional $ 45 00 send & # 34 ; uv sun visor & # 34 ; clips onto strollers hood does match expensive stroller ? nope ! in fact , resembles hefty trash bag but , *does* maclaren logo everyone know expensive ! yay ! the front wheels/dirty hood issue- whenever fold stroller front wheels press tighly canopy leaving remains wheatever recently rolled everyone see after 90 days absolutely disgusting looking 
-1	i bottle feed infant son , i 've particular not using bottles n't glass even without bpa , never know plastic still use later discovered unforeseen long-term harmful effects i heard bottles came glass , n't -theseare i gotten so 're particular not feeding plastic bottles i , make sure 're getting right product 
-1	at end day , parents washing lot things kitchen dishes , glasses , counters , baby spoons , floors , course baby bottles and night , 're also pretty tired it start appreciate baby bottles pieces these bottles lot individual pieces , washing takes twice long simple designs i 4 pieces , already felt like many clean but ones take cake , 6 distinct parts clean and 's least 3 many in end , become favorites ( 2 pieces bottles ) if n't want spend extra time washing baby bottles skip these removing cleaning equation , good bottles : - bpa free- good quality plasticour baby n't experience less gas using complicated system , versus normal 2 pieces bottle setup so additional cleaning not worth opinion

-1	i love idea sun shades , twisted folded fit package , i could not get flat enough stick window i put full diaper boxes month try flatten , still would not lay flat the cling side would stick window left side ( example ) , frame twisted right side not window it cold , i also tried day freezing n't make difference i n't think cold plastic cling side the problem bend frame i returning trying similar one suction cup middle hopefully frame little bent wo n't really matter 
-1	these arrived impossible straighten flat car windows we n't understand positive reviews the wire edge warped twisted would not lay flat the saving grace contacted britax directly tell disappointed , send photo condition shades , ended sending us free set the free set better condition still would n't pay 
-1	these stuck windows okay ( even winter utah ) , hardly provided shade we returned something else i would n't recommend 
-1	ended returning : - small back window prius- when i actually put , i spend good 30 min trying get rid wrinkles i still not 100 % succeffull- finally , driving , i felt really obscured view - dark remaining wrinkled not help decided simply put light fabric baby 's car seat shade- i even reach adjust needed 
-1	i needed shade back windows sedan protect newborn direct sun rays i bought particular product based positive reviews amazon trust britax brand name ( i love car seat stroller ) only positive sticks well window it not block sun it looks like thin black mesh window nothing , n't even reduce intensity sun rays you see shade screen sun light falls , u put hand shade feel sun i still hold blanket window shade car seat 
-1	this product folds nicely , looks nice it not cling advertised cleaning windows several times not help , kept falling also , size lacking , stick covered window i would not recommend product i returned item refund 
-1	these not stay clung windows matter i i tried husband 's vehicles they completely worthless 
-1	i wish returned kept hoping would end using n't used they n't block much light also small 
-1	i returned n't cling onto window smoothly they lots air bubbles would n't come looked tacky 
-1	these shades say stick right windows , i tried , fell i may try wetting first see help , sitting table , not blocking sun all update : nothing worked finally taped windows 
-1	got prevent sun blinding little girl 's front facing car seat got seemed great i went use and sun still blinding , maybe blocked 10 % not successful reducing direct sun rays try different brand , n't worth even though seems like getting good deal price wise 
-1	i disappointed i n't know i got faulty product not stick window i tried two different cars not stay also , wide frame twisted packaging came i not using 
-1	these really easy put , plus however , n't really block sun well , kind obstruct view i 'm driving 
-1	kind useless car i big suv , ford flex , back windows divided 1 big window 1 small ( n't open ) sun shades pretty small , n't even cover half big window i guess would ok sedan adhesive 's kind cool since 's easy use 
-1	they small n't cover entire window result still get sun rays inside car 
-1	in picture item looked like shade van window i n't know window would make appear normal size this small not happy 
-1	they really seem not provide much coverage suv windows they also look & # 34 ; messy & # 34 ; window i ca n't get look smooth my 2 year old easily pull window defeats purpose it ok newborn baby n't look great they n't expensive i guess plus i n't done full research , i would assume better option ! 
-1	need return order something bigger sun still gets sons face matter i place 
-1	i ca n't get stick windows oh well i , however , put together stick top rear window , moving around depending sun coming baby they together thick enough stay put , wedged window & # 34 ; ceiling & # 34 ; interior 
-1	i 1996 toyota avalon , not stick at all ! my back windows curved bit maybe 's i put one pressed rubbed , let go , fell right i assume 's install , came directions , i clue water involved , 's something special i n't the one barely clung long enough see also way small windows did n't work ! 
-1	this nothing baby terms blocking sun toyota highlander it 's not really tinted dark tends fall windows i would not recommend 
-1	this not last long it looks nice appears well made however , within first 2 weeks seat front 2 y o , discovered could hook heels pockets yank i driving highway , nothing i could stop pockets survived , mat completely ripped away strap ties around front seat headrest wish sturdier fabric construction 
-1	i wanted kick mat cover seat back prevent mud , dirt , etc from staining seat these mats definitely short task 
-1	they fold side top bottom kind way anything i wish little sturdy frame somehow able secured seat corners pulled tight my kids really n't used either like i thought would , 's probably something i n't really need first place sounds like good idea now i could keep son 's feet a/c heater vents middle position ! 
-1	within two days installing backs car seats , one already falling apart the thin fabric shredded away binding hanging strap very unimpressed i would n't buy 
-1	once i put car seat baby , could barely move he 2 months old fully dressed i could see would n't last long *instead roll receiving blankets put beside baby support them*also , tried stroller - go 
-1	my baby year old not car seat anymore however i ordered use stroller like description said made , mostly side support something softer head rest , softer sit it pretty well , seems fairly well made material wise the problem way secure stroller it forms around belt straps so baby moves shifts around , thing and worse , fold stroller storage house trunk , flops so every time setup stroller use readjusting pillow also , space headrest body rest not long enough tall baby this thing obviously made focus car seat not stroller not marketed true insert stroller if anyone knows better alternative , please reply review ! thanks 
-1	used exactly twice britax b-safe infant seat , made seat cramped 9lb baby she hated carseat removed pad , fine 
-1	this `` organic '' cotton/bamboo item also happens contain 30 % polyester inner lining , area touches skin conveniently neglected mention particular detail description personally , i bought organic training pant order avoid synthetics like polyester - especially since son sensitive i would appreciated transparent description , instead greenwashing 
-1	not much my pack hardly beads get heated cooled little impact great idea , though for heat pack , i ended using tip natural blog instead : heat dried beans dried rice old ( clean ! ) sock microwave seconds presto ! 
-1	fits standard pacifiers ? does n't fit common pacifiers , nuk avent soothers not sure pacifier would actually fit honest so n't waste money like i 
-1	i ended returning sleep sack even though labeled & # 34 ; small & # 34 ; considerably larger halo sleep sacks already small but main reason i returned fabric rough -- similar burlap and colors even brighter shown picture i worried color alone would stimulating baby fall asleep quickly 
-1	i wanted like cups trips house i want keep milk cool no dice i agree reviews bad milk flowing straw kind pressure issue time consuming put together correctly , hassle screaming toddler it sounds like son getting lot air drinks well overall , i wish i n't wasted money cups on note , half price target even want try cups n't buy amazon 
-1	i actually loved concept activity gym appreciated colors , still playful , not face blaring like many activity gyms the mat easy clean i really like toys ( bumble bee favorite ! ) bonus frequently rotate give play own all said , structure flimsy n't matter the activity mat never looked like picture it always sagged i noticed first couple weeks , one plastic poles holds snapped two it still held , careful placed toys the design could easily made could least remove plastic tubes duct tape areas snap put back , alas not ( for reference - tubes similar straws diameter , thicker , sides arch that only thing holds arch ) now another snap , gym hard hold 's even another piece snapped , 8 times 10 , babies ( i twins would put separate times ) would pull top head fortunately soft , extremely disappointing at price , built much better we got weeks use attaching arch , twins still play toys , better options even explode colors 
-1	leaks ! leaks ! leaks ! leaks ! i just like the handles on the cup but not a good cup because it leaks 
-1	still drawer tried baby inconvenient hid socks designs not mention makes look like something happened babies foot

-1	i purchased training cups year ago spout `` y '' shaped cut allow flow liquid pass they best cups transitioning son bottle sippy soft spout slow flow liquid recently spouts 2 cups i became really worn one yellow spout turning black ( first thought mold i could not scrub/boil realized material changing color ) blue spout finally bitten i purchased replacement spouts find cut tip horizontal slit instead y cut the material also seemed lot firmer making slit stay open instead closing immediately son stopped sucking this allowed liquids spill easily also much liquid flow son drinking after failing find suitable replacement spouts i decided call manufacturer see still made y cut spouts i told not make longer changed manufacturers spouts when i asked materials i told however i doubt true since old spouts much pliable overall cup use to be amazing new horizontal slitted spouts totally disappointing they leak everywhere ! 
-1	my son loves sophie , , so i got one throw diaper bag car i n't carry sophie everywhere it kinda expensive i expecting good quality turns , not the bottom part vulli become black i not remove ( tried scrubbing , sterilizing ) i scared give product son i n't know became dark bottom , upon sterilizing thing peeling ? ? i n't know , , looks dirty bottom 
-1	very bulky canopy useless would n't stay do not like fits onto b agile stroller returned item 
-1	i new cloth diapering wanted make easiest transition , especially husband that i went all-in-one i purchased hook & loop reading adjusts better snaps , already prepositioned diaper with daughters ever changing belly & thighs ( chubby ) i thought would good option however , laundry tabs ( `` loop '' part velcro ) back rub directly as well front velcro , rubs bit belly hangs sitting position it left marks , along scratch corner tab i rubbed material back not feel good i imagine must feel sensitive , baby soft skin i ordered freetime snaps see i like better but i also ordered bumgenius 4 0 i also unhappy bulkiness diaper i give 2* 1* works great diaper , absorbent wise i update i try two 
-1	after trying many bum genius diapers i decided elemental favorite with freetime considering attached flaps the washer could n't clean well enough started urine smell build my washer hard time agitating diaper never seemed clean diapers also 4 0 dries faster since insert removable 
-1	it 's ok , way 's designed & # 34 ; tray & # 34 ; part slants toward baby , creating food slide right kids lap lot fun not but high chair portable pinch 
-1	the kids figured open right away 
-1	i ordered 2nd baby i thought would work nice new born installing already pretty difficult quality materials poor it not sturdy the music not suitable newborn it not soothing soft the quality poor rocker after installing , i not want uninstall , put back box return it do n't buy , look something else especially money this way expensive worth 
-1	purchsed thinking good transition crib flat found much smaller expeted 4 months old coudnt fit it i ordered borwn color army green , not rocking properly baby hates 
-1	bought tiny love daughter 's new born baby she never used sides not visible she ended using little bassinet put bed my daughter ended using infant napper : summer infant by your side sleeper bedding it mesh sides parents view baby time 's bed 
-1	this rocker great different recline positions however , noisy when son asleep moves , makes creaking noises wakes , problem i 'm trying get things done around house naps i stop put back sleep 
-1	the design concept great , handy , not well made - handle broke extension stuck beginning if better made , i would give stars easy attach seat even though daughter no interest riding airport , saved us carry around really not feasible big car seat , luggage baby 
-1	short version : works trolley , not child transport not compatible evenflo symphony e3 tips tsa-inconvenient i really , really wanted like product at half price , i would recommend friends sake carting around extra bags seem absolutely necessary traveling small children it simply not work advertised long version : we evenflo symphony e3 i excited use get son airport ! i read reviews , manual got installed correctly , checked weight size limits , gave son little safety lesson told not swing legs , sit back not lurch forward , obliged , yet within 60 feet getting whole thing together , tipped i assumed user error double checked everything my husband behind son n't thrashed anything the car seat cinched far could go it toppled son ( i caught n't hit ground ) my husband engineer , took look we tried times , time would make even slightest turn , matter slowly , one wheel would come ground our conclusion car seat not compatible the straps roll n go low , base car seat rests shallow -- car seat base hangs edge significantly the manual says might need remove base car seat work , n't detach once got security , made us disassemble , pain , since gate checked seat anyway we ended using trolley car seat diaper bag , fastened handle not throw weight so least convenience , n't carry car seat for i 'll give 1 5 stars 
-1	i got evenflo sureride 65 the base seat slanted part none bottom rested car seat transporter 's base the make also n't seem strong there way manufacturer 's website find would actually fit car seat , short buying trying we ended magna [ [ http : //www amazon com/gp/product/b000hvvsdu/ ] ] personal cart ( cheaper costco ) much deeper base fit seat nicely ! it 's also good i use myriad uses , not transporting carseat 
-1	if seat base not flat completely line back chair , flap drops hold seat not reach base roller wont work it work brittax , not diono 
-1	i super busy mom toddler crawler i time reviewing stuff , simply speak i purchased product mid 2009 , perhaps improvements made , gripes:1 ) clear plastic cover tray impossible get off 2 ) tray never sat properly circular niches either side always wobbly3 ) while 's visually appealing , hip , something 'd like house along real grown furniture ( fixture least years , right ? ) looks awful the espresso finish im guessing poor choice , finish dings nicks looks like 's world war iii point i uploaded couple pics 4 ) 800 allen wrench screw allow major adjustments kid grows , good thing , loosen time , every months dig the gross food screw ( do wipe thing thoroughly time son eats ! ) fit allen wrench ( find where you put it ) tighten screw i dont have time for ths silliness 5 ) million other crevices food collect , i take outside scrub toothbrush occasion get clean i went oxo 2nd son , far pleased far 
-1	the pattern not worth price difference you get plain organic cotton cover money & much better i bought summer infant patterned covers like one along solid organic terry cotton one ( also summer infant ) i wish i gotten organic cotton the material feels plastickey , almost like would not absorb water i n't like touching let alone baby 's head rest the pattern cute i use pad liner covers surface i n't get see pattern often love 100 % solid color , organic cotton version though on plus side , fit pad well i like slits side safety buckles come though i not using buckle yet , i guess i baby older 
-1	cups leak retain moisture washing mold build up disposed cups gerber 12+ month basic cups much better

-1	i bought i 'm sucker cool design classic case looks cool completely impractical the flip top tight took minutes open my 16 month old would never able the first day used , daughter dropped grocery cart popped open spilling water floor i 'll stick nuby cups awesome leak proof 
-1	it n't matter close tightly not or put straw right not it leaks , leaks , spills nuk used straw active cup not leak ! i know i one that nuk straw cup not leak spill too bad 's hard find anymore 
-1	this great concept lots pros , large size , valve-free straw goes bottom bottle however , i afraid cons outweigh pros the biggest problem clear plastic second top twists close open silicone straw not hard twist almost impossible clean underneath , liquid child drinking bottle gets trapped bottle clear plastic top leaks hole clear plastic top therefore , not use bottle anything water i like idea valve-free straw looking one market long time ( one like green sprouts aqua bottle plastic made cracks second dropped ) happy find one , proven not good design 
-1	sorry i hate leave bad reviews , first born free product really bummed out i gave 2 stars ( instead 1 ) i use larger cup fit born free sippy tops this cup not designed anyone kids , anyone dishes it pain clean impossible close , plain silly you ca n't disassemble top compartment close , holds liquid i tried soaking , scrubbing , could n't get old milk compartment gross i tossed ( kept big born free cup part fits born free stuff ) 
-1	good cup 's assembled its big flaw straw narrow 's inconvenient wash dishwasher - slips holes basket 's narrow fit spoke 
-1	n't bother thing , cheaply made , parts not snap together shown ( comparison original exersaucer ) save trouble , girl ? want deck girly style - did/are babies r us purple version comes floor mat tummy time $ 30 , save floor mat end 
-1	oh i research product read good bad reviews decided go ahead get anyway oh horrible ! at least i gave try the top top heavy it not open way makes 2 yr old son able take coins impossible it smashed hand every time tried retrieve toys the volume almost non-existent i barely hear even room completely quite so disappointed many flaws ! i returned right away do not recommend i purchased fisher price 's piggy bank instead love & used professionals universally ! 
-1	the design , others mentioned , pretty poor the top chest heavy , child not get top open get coins it also n't open way ca n't even reach get coins the volume also low , hard hear also coins the pro different modes colors , shapes counting over i 'm disappointed 
-1	adorably cute cover , however , ridiculously bulky love taggies products , thing so bulky would n't even fit compartment city mini stroller while son loved touching taggies , i return gigantic i ended getting jj cole cover pleased it $ 25 ( opposed $ 40 taggies ) compact easy use too bad product 
-1	does not attach way show i picture stay way i could n't ever see baby facing forward 's loves it sensitive though when go bumps turn back due timer it loud even soft setting however i gave two stars buying see baby driving n't work right 
-1	not impressed design diaper the snap placement not would expect strange the inner layer bamboo buy inserts separately what joke it leaks i 'm not getting 
-1	doesnt really go bottles waste amazon money i would skip be sure right equipment 
-1	i already hadoxo tot straw sippy cup top cleaning setfor cleaning milk sippy cups , wanted straw brushes smoothie cups straws these seemed like bargain upon first usage cleaning baby straws , i felt munchkin brush dragging pulled upon closer inspection ( also see amazon 's zoomed picture ) , tips munchkin brushes merely bent back , not capped smooth ball tip like oxo brush the bent tip 's edge cuts flakes anything brushed : silicon/plastic/metal , name you 'd better running straws running water using brushes or , better yet , order another set oxo 
-1	i love two five star reviews people ordered give gift never even seen toy use ! uh help anyone know looks like picture ? we received gift , someone thought looked fun it look fun this toy n't work , never worked us the idea cute : fill cup top , trickle causing top section whirl , middle section move little balls around , final section spin on , penguin part works our penguin stays pretty well , collapse want , also watch interior twirl it twirl little , kind slowly if fill middle section , trouble filling , trouble draining the balls nothing it rattle empty , bath toy n't anything special water if fill bottom section , drains bottom the thing middle not spin if keep pieces connected , , top twirls minimally nothing else happens if separate pieces , starfish part middle drains pattern sometimes if water n't get stuck the fish bottom still nothing i think 're probably going throw away if 're considering buying ( kiddo gift ) save money buy something else anything else worst bath toy ever ! 
-1	there better bath toys they look cute 's kids sort like far not favorites 
-1	i concern baby able remove hands , still small said , consider hock not strong enough may stable 
-1	really ok thing kid never really got i 'd probably go sound machine , something n't go crib 
-1	we got cups baby gift tried , along several brands , started giving son water 6 months old the good part handles make easy grasp lift , prefers spout cup 've tried the bad news , though , cheaply made he using sippy cups 3 months , 've already three cups crack dropped side high chair ( normal wear tear given intended use ) we switching nuk trainer cup , second favorite , much sturdy

-1	as matter fact , 's better getting i tiny fingers make easy grasp product they easier get old standard generic flat plug covers not good buy 
-1	these easy adults open doors , seemed like kept 2 year old opening doors , spun aroudn door knob , could n't get purchase so figured hit repeatedly came knob , day two end story 
-1	these different plug covers i already use n't lock they n't lock easily come socket locked unlocked position i not using 
-1	i received locks gift , thought looked like would great i installed outlet cover would not lock once 8 month figured i , came investigate it took 10 seconds figure pull cover outlet wo n't using 
-1	the & # 34 ; lock & # 34 ; n't lock it handle pop make removing plug guard easier however , i 9 month old able easily pull rounded cover socket without even using pop handle not child safe i returned 
-1	half safety items children cheaply made n't say , gets 5 stars this keeps 2 yr old refrigerator every single time these munchkin latches strong adhesives sides connected nice heavier plastic strap to open push tabs side latches releases , simple to put back , need lined back snap , 's really not much takes adults little remember door n't coming open unlatched finally child 's safety item works , take wallpaper varnish removed 
-1	i two year old twin girls made mission figure child safety locks some locks take longer others , one took hour not creative design , might trick unmotivated toddler 
-1	these would n't fit onto stove you would stove not counters fit great idea , bad design 
-1	it 's hard use , finally use , n't work i suppose plug bottom , designed help clean , would useful feature possible get thing dirty first place get one gave hospital , basicbulb syringe aspirator , want something actually works you also find drug stores 
-1	this thing impossible use you hardly squeeze trying use squirming baby pointless provides little suction a total waste money

-1	save $ 4 product buy version flexible strap this one hard/non bending strap 2 sticky parts connect either side appliance door the strap comes lock pulling this works fine holding when actually attach appliance , put strap lock hold unlock button opening door , strap forcefully flies , works the issue really comes try close appliance door put strap back lock area you not get strap since not bend not move strap side latch away lock side latch since stationary stuck appliance i took right really adhered threw waste money i try flexible strap version instead hope works - ( [ ] )

-1	the hole kid sit small it 's useless boys spray floor ( pee shield ! ) 
-1	i 13 month old twins looking good , non-leaking cup i like weighted straw closed however , couple months started leak much i ca n't use them they leaking , primarily , threading i opened re-closed making sure threading 'just right ' several times , still , cup lays side ( within 1 minute hands ) forms puddle - puddle floor makes unhappy mama ! i bought 2 2-cup package , 2 cups leaking worse others ironically , ones n't leaking threading starting interesting issue straw : you know siphon gas starting suction process gas keep coming ? i noticed straws , kids drink set cup properly , milk keep coming straw ( physics 101 right ? ) which means even cup placed correctly ( not side leaks threading ) puddle still form straw ! i disappointed - expensive leak like thrown ! i started using nuk gerber graduates grips trainer cups , i like better , n't leak ! ! ! ! i wish straw cover like zoli , twins i ultimately choose leaking ! 
-1	worst cup ever ! i problems liquids leaking straw i switched air conditioned house hot muggy outdoors such pain use i grateful amazon accepted return even though used one cups 
-1	i several wooded rattles/teethers least favorite my lo constantly gags i 'd like better shorter round they clean easy maybe little later pretend keys ? ?

-1	i using crib daughter 5 months she 10 months old used monte bassinet first 5 months bedroom after two months using crib paint started chipping ! i n't understand crib barely used already chipping invest oeuf 
-1	i really excited using , even though take forever take box put when i , boy i disappointed ! while 's great idea storing cash cards small things , cup holders terrible no matter smooth ride , organizer rocks movement stroller causes every drink spill hot drinks especially concerning position organizer , hot drink could spill right onto baby 's head 
-1	when originally arrived i pleased the size functions ( two insulated cup-holders , pouch keys/snacks/wallet , outside pouch phone ) exactly i looking but several months use bugaboo , velcro longer keeps place whole console falls towards stroller not useful , especially drinks ! so although i wanted love , i ca n't say i 
-1	this stroller bulky unwieldy minutes putting together , right mud flap fell wo n't stay place i multiple strollers including bob , mcclaren , chicco , graco this far worst stroller i owned 
-1	not much annoys product made ugly lawyers except marketing people sell product based fraudulent photo n't show warning text the entire lower 30 % bed rail printed dark black legal warning text due way supports pinned rail , way turn around either ( which would n't help much anyway , since fabric semi-transparent , see black text either side 
-1	i tried several nursing pads disposable reusable bamboobies least favorite they fairly noticeable clothing unlined nursing/maternity bra the pink ones not absorbent , blue ones offer protection i also heavy leaker , may problem also , found stick nipples without lanolin , painful `` tear '' if looking cotton , reusable nursing pads , i 'd recommend dappi organic pads medela cotton nursing pads- dappi absorbent , soft , discreet 
-1	these awful they 're not even towel , thin blanket type material i dunno , maybe 's people using days bathing infants i prefer towel i put towel whatever surface i 'm placing baby bath water seeps right thru 
-1	did n't like fabric , thin not absorb anything i not recommend pay little buy something really works 
-1	great idea baby trouble ripping every surface 've put 
-1	the seat strange rather letting stand straight forces forward tray the battery not last one use next very disappointing 
-1	i happy find high contrast activity mat little one one not ugly unfortunately became not contrasty i washed i followed directions manufacture i washed ice cold water i say ice cold i mean we record breaking zero weather this affects temperature water the water turn fingers icicles running as precaution , i threw half box color catcher sheets ran hand wash cycle machine i wanted cry i took mat everything white turned bright pink what thinking using red dye bleeds like something meant baby ? 
-1	my son waking scared middle night pitch black , decided pick nightlight it adorable , colors beautiful , wanted died 3 nights use i 'm assuming bad egg , disappointed returned did n't see could change batteries anything 
-1	do n't waste money 
-1	every time i used nipple feed newborn , would spit half bottle flow way fast switched dr browns level 1 issues nicely made nipple , hopefully useful grows older needs faster flow 
-1	my toddler infant love sippies , since n't much resistance get liquid ( sippies ridiculously hard drink ) straws total junk they 're thin child bites , rip we ordered replacements , ripped within couple months really need find new sippy switch , toddler pretty resistant sippy change the sippies also leak like crazy 
-1	this product total bust us it not stay put either cars ( equinox & prius ) if could installed properly , would perfect 
-1	we loved first , car freezing temps stopped working music light 
-1	do n't spend extra $ light - it n't anything 
-1	this worst mirror ever it n't fit correctly the baby looks like 's like away able see when position , ride moves become unable see baby the music sounds like something horror movie do not buy ! 
-1	well 3 month old loves thing , 20 seconds plays my in-laws bought , i really excited reviews fantastic first , not come type instruction manual , i figured played 20 seconds thing matter setting i put , stuck demo mode there nothing back showed definitive try tag , i went online see one not , , well , i found one , although i could n't find specifics looked like this not supposed rocket science , 's baby soother so i 've decided must try `` tag '' white t-shaped piece plastic pull tab came firmly jammed deep back soother i tried fishing flathead screwdriver managed shove even i also made mistake showing son taking box , made hour long scream fest due super angry unless i pressed button every 20 seconds keep running thanks fisher-price i gave 2 stars theory 's great , first 20 seconds 's fantastic ; ) 
-1	these disappointment it much hard son get liquid turn take huge amount effort , without valve , spill completely i put away maybe try bit older 
-1	these spoons thin flimsy small i like fact american made safe , small lightweight , i replaced green toys spoons forks , i also reviewed 
-1	so form recycling actually sounds like good idea actually receive product the texture feels like thicker version milk carton , even 's formed utensils typically would n't bother , kids matter , bend anything extremely cheap i would n't recommend 
-1	i managed get seat secure well 2009 scion xb , even reclined position , seems like sitting straight my sons head slumps forward looks uncomfortable i get good deal , i dont think i would recommend needs able recline little better not impressed 
-1	the clip holder hard open it not good little baby this probably better suited toddlers another downside ca n't get paci easily commit one pacifier stay holder forever 
-1	came dirty not happy called exchange completely reorder get credit , kinda annoying 
-1	look , i 'm cute baby products , one cute however , i think utmost quality baby products safety , product not seem safe the clip made metal quite sharp easy baby cut him/herself i returned item i n't recommend 
-1	i knew better i could n't help i could look picture tell goose egg forehead waiting happen before i baby i even remember seeing one store thinking dangerous looked i blame first-time mommy brain i bought addition large activity bouncer add variety my son ( 6 months i bought , 10 months old ) loves activity bouncer he could happily bounce away day he jumps hard i thought might enjoy freedom able move around bit the problem johnny jump up wide around seat either lean forward backward it angle leg holes weight sits seat sling the child photo upright , get normal sized child upright ( even great head , leg , body control ) i stuff kinds towels around i could live except jumps thing swings around bangs door frame this caused child pinch arms fingers door he also swung head door frame he 's fine , 's fun hover make sure n't actually jump toy called johnny jump up i tried putting pillows door frame 's lot trouble something essentially activity bouncer not well the spring also tight little bounce mostly swing finally , hung door couple months blocked path , i took good my parent 's house large opening living dining room 's chance bouncing door frame nearby furniture i 'm going try here 's hoping earns one star i give it if , i recommend getting activity bouncer they take space cost really great entertaining kid 
-1	terrible sterilizer bottles smell burnt every use unit always look dirty inside matter well clean

-1	i excited monitors ability talk 2 year old instead going room every time called they worked great i happy monitors , 9 months , ( like mentioned several reviews ) stopped working they not reset , beep screen flashes `` not linked '' i bought dec 2012 lasted till sept 2013 course warranty march disappointed update 10/3/13called vtech within 5 minutes someone line they sending replacement within 3-5 days impressed customer service , hope monitor lasts longer ! 
-1	i loved audio monitor 9 months it easy set , easy use , worked great 2 parent units awesome why n't baby monitors come 2 parent units ? well , today , i accidentally kicked power strip sorting stuff baby 's room powered baby unit when i powered back , parent units would n't connect baby units i tried everything manual trouble shooting website , i came see anyone else problem and know lots people problem so 's known issue manufacturer 's solution send replacement so let see i understand situation : every time i power baby unit , audio monitor cease function i call get replacement ? that 's ridiculous we 're move i n't time deal getting audio monitor replaced knowing month move unplug , i call get replaced i returning unit shopping another product i probably note unplug 2-3 times happened , n't happen right away looking reviews , seems happen unplug 6 months use 
-1	i purchased monitor june 2013 i using september 2013 february 2013 i really liked system lcd screen one parent units stopped working it point i ca n't tell charged linked -- rendering useless i ca n't tell working i call vtech person i spoke acknowledged troubleshooting he says i need send entire system replacement ( i e , parent units monitor ) replacement arrive 2 weeks shipping time um , i supposed interim ? ? ? this piece safety equipment , i need every night am i supposed buy second system use replace defective product ? very , disappointed 
-1	this worked pretty well while worked we bought june 2012 , daughter born that thanksgiving , lots family town set pack play room moved base could hear it would not reconnect spending way long trying trouble shoot , ended going weekend without one ( constantly going check went bed ) it warranty , i pay shipping send vtech sent replacement one it worked went away birthday week brought monitor us it thing , stuck without monitor constantly check unfortunately warranty runs 1 year , 're stuck broken monitor buy new one i went $ 15 one target time , n't issues have impressed far quality price ! 
-1	this monitor cuts i hear baby crying one second next monitor n't working , minutes later kick back the lights not work notify baby 's sounds you ca n't tell 's actually connected , hope 's working when work sound muffled yet echoes the night light wo n't stay , sometimes comes baby cries sometimes comes i walk room , not always i 'd like stay time , like night light basically thing sucks 
-1	pros:1 no static ! 2 holds decent charge , least 6 hours3 talk back feature nice although never really used it4 the ability control baby base unit parental monitor unit handycons:1 too smart good : tries filter background noises ends filtering baby noises well2 probably reason # 1 , microphone n't sensitive enough even highest sensitivity , tends pick baby hollering 3 speaker could bit louder summary : we gave monitor good solid 3 weeks , really tried like , 's returned today ( huge thumbs amazon 's return policy ) it truly crystal clear tries filter background noises , kind disadvantage well , 's main reason 're returning it even though 're baby # 2 , 're still paranoid would like able hear 's going baby 's room being able hear baby make small noises reassuring 1 : baby alive ( i know , paranoid thing , parent n't thought cross mind baby stays quiet unusual length time ? ) , 2 : monitor functioning , 3 : get baby gets super pissed inconsolable the monitor good job trying filter background noise ends filtering 75 % baby 's noises well not big deal filters breathing noises little cooing noises makes , unfortunately , also filters whimpering whining all sudden , hear hollering screaming now baby take longer calm down even highest sensitivity setting , quieter baby noises get filtered after 3 weeks getting baby late , 're throwing towel going back 4-year old analog sony babycall it static , beeps randomly , least picks every noise get baby hits defcon 1 and said , even max volume , speaker barely loud enough hear background noises ( tv low volume ) 
-1	i wanted like monitor- one definitely stinks it quiet even highest setting baby barely audible i would constantly check make sure i n't missing cries- point defeats purpose monitor if i happen hear faint something monitor i would tell everyone house quiet stop everything everyone hear baby crying monitor i checked manual- i everything right volume turned high - high setting monitor sounds like low monitor do n't get wrong/ i 'm not looking rock concert loud- high enough volume i hear monitor next quietly washing dishes i n't feel setting bar high sent one back bought motorola one babies r us much happier no static crystal clear- loud sound now doubt- i know crying 
-1	it important know spend money monitor the monitors not interchangeable all monitors must plugged the infant monitor must stay plugged time the parent monitors make absolutely horrid , obnoxious beeping sound even fully charged unplugged the beep actually louder infant screaming might it 's absolutely ridiculous ! ! ! the night-light nice feature , , monitors actually portable , really not , unless want listen scream unplugged and/or want wake child it works basics , nothing 
-1	in theory great monitor when worked , awesome parent units intercom one another good sound but stopped working i emailed v-tech customer service never heard back the baby unit suddenly started intermittently transmitting sound , sometimes hear baby sometimes n't matter sensitivity setting very frustrating i ca n't rely monitors alert baby awake crying 
-1	i must say loved monitor no interference worry big problem building one day simply stopped working the parent units stopped communicating base despite taking batteries , turning hours various suggestions , simply not work anymore ! we not even 6 months ! 
-1	update : this monitor great stopped working several months purchase judging reviews reoccurring problem probably due defective/cheap part do not buy monitor we first bought video monitor broke month decided go since 's made canada great company the range amazing ! ! ! actually works neighbors house battery life good love 
-1	this monitor almost perfect ! ! ! ! i never unplugged like others said month use randomly stopped linking base unit could n't get stop , i returned bought infant optics video monitor a little expensive monitor n't 2 parent units i really wanted , i love love new monitor well worth price ! ! ! ! ! 
-1	pros : -inexpensive-2 parent units-good sound qualitycons : -battery life aweful - turned completely , battery n't even hold charge day when , maybe got couple hours tops - nowhere near 9hrs claimed -frequently lost connection seemingly random times it beep let know 's lost connection helpful also annoying would happen half dozen times per day you need power unit , power back reestablish connection tedious range n't seem make difference setup definitely low end range scale ( 30-50ft max ) after reading reviews issues n't seem isolated frequent occurence model overall , 2 cons make product unfit intended purpose fortunately amazon great returns i able return 6 months later questions asked 
-1	works great , i return first one five months main unit suddenly stopped communicating satellite units it apparently hardware malfunction somewhat common among units i returned got second set working fine month edit : the transmitter main unit replacement product burned ten months same deal first time : got turned quite , turned back transmitter longer worked giving updated status 2 stars even though works well replaced nicely , neither unit lasted long 
-1	works fine , 20 months screen stopped working i longer see 's going trying adjust things also buttons confusing fumbling dark 
-1	we got monitor 2 years ago last 9 10 months screen not worked it n't big issue since i still hear , today i moved monitor daughter 's room ( room 25ft away ) i ca n't get base monitor connect i not troubleshoot issue since 2/3 screen n't work i not see channel etc now i buy another monitor ( definitely not brand ! ! ) i still use daughter baby way if going spend money , i highly recommend investing worthy product 
-1	whenever leave window open nursery , back house , get low level hum outside noise , even sensitivity way it makes hard sleep night crack window air circulation also , parent baby units get close , create feedback when carry around monitor , 's difficult remember take leave another room go check baby 
-1	we got 8 months to fare , use constantly we almost always plugged , battery receiver barely holds charge anyway also , bottom half screen dead , rendering whole screen useless well special features like vibrate cant read screen set them i think i would rather spent bit one lasted 
-1	the sound sensitivity monitor pretty good the range not huge , suits needs my big complaint battery parent unit not stay charged it n't even last full length nap , n't portable i find annoying 
-1	i bought monitor target major issue infant optics video monitor it supposed temporary monitor could research find better video monitor buy i figured 'd use weeks nope , i used last night 's getting returned today the monitor fairly simple use the big issue i parent unit kept losing signal 's counterpart continuously throughout night this thing 1000 foot range , n't matter range , signal b/w units continuously dropped throughout night and loses signal , beeps obnoxiously i walk closer unit get link i mean happened 10 times last night so i got 10 times guess many times baby got ? once this thing woke 10x son ridiculous also , issue old monitor , i 'm paranoid monitor kicking middle night not able hear baby there & # 34 ; on & # 34 ; light indicator unit see dark there light show 's plugged charge , 's i could n't even get backlight stay , i 'd hold cell phone monitor see said & # 34 ; linked & # 34 ; still terrible product 
-1	the sound quality terrible battery life tragic if i n't bring plug everywhere , i lose battery it picks alot static cell phone within 10 feet causes feedback i would n't wish upon anyone 
-1	bought monitor second child i wish i would found first it works everywhere around home n't interfere electronics , i definitely recommend item looking monitor without video fast forward nine months product works well , screen monitor longer works properly 's impossible change setting easily b/c ca n't see i 'm still satisfied transmission monitor not working screen makes product nuance i 'm revising rating 
-1	when received item , everything looked fine dandy linking went fine etc but problem baby unit picking sounds ( talking regular volume ) within 3-4 inches we keep little one 's room , realized could n't even hear crying , unless kept right next face and played around sensitivity levels etc so unfortunately , item didnt work us as reviewers good things say baby monitor , could i got defective piece but given reviewer d clark exact experience , little qc would nice 
-1	i bought monitor in-laws used technology current monitors i love , less expensive however keep disconnecting horrible i returned i would n't recommend anyone ! 
-1	this spare monitor travel visit friends/family and/or go camping i loved price the sound/range system pretty good battery capacity i dislike lack video display able see baby crying product ( obviously ) n't video display so i would give 3 stars i knocked additional star parental unit display parts characters missing - characters n't displayed time different ( example & # 34 ; e & # 34 ; might show & # 34 ; i & # 34 ; ) 
-1	i received gift stopped working 7 months use ! it would periodically make staticky noise ! registered bc pretty good reviews very sad ! 
-1	amended original 5star review , changed 1star ( i would give zero-stars possible ) after four months use , monitor stopped working the parent unit longer transmitting sound baby monitor no sound at all i found i walked close room heard baby crying inside , even though monitor turned dead silent by way , led display also completely messed this completely unacceptable baby monitor i returning product tomorrow buying another monitor so much value-for-money product -- -- -as new mum , i 've buying types baby products , getting around reviewing we 've using monitor since baby came home hospital , impressed set , especially given price with negative reviews , i afraid i 'd get lot static , unclear sounds spotty reception far , vtech monitor great the sound crystal clear 's sensitive enough pick small noises snuffles it various excellent features , particular , `` talk back '' function receiver parent unit useful , not talking baby , also talk partner may inside baby there 's also `` page '' function alert receive parent unit , well night light finally , i also like way parent unit beeps continuously baby unit turned gets disconnected i ca n't speak range , n't live big apartment , reception remains good around 5 walls throughout place the drawback i 've discovered product charge n't last long parent unit it runs rechargeable battery day ( around 15 hours ) , charged , need remember recharge and ca n't charge parent unit room baby unit feedback apart inconvenience , excellent buy , especially price point , simple effective baby sound monitor i prefer baby items effective serving basic function , like less expensive items n't i feel unnecessary bells whistles this baby monitor vote !

-1	horrible design n't work well child stick little fingers crack get pinched not match cabinets 
-1	i looking type cabinet lock would protect babies toddlers danger reasonably easy adults open not product fail either plastic straps ( integral tightening loosening locks ) crack , stretch , eventually stop working not , putting cabinets time-consuming opened ( adults want get cabinet ) n't lock place easily fail 
-1	i put cabinet cleaning supplies little one ca n't access it work however , husband i ca n't access either it 's tough get , set whatever 're carrying requires 2 hands open i would definitely recommend different kind 
-1	i feel horrible writing bad reviews i could n't refrain one these , diffult unlock the concept great i needed additional tools stick green lock area open it took long made feel like idiot there way put cabinets actually need get every awhile love concept , hate execution 
-1	my little guy 10 weeks old , 13 lbs neck opening already small he 's got chubby neck , still , i ca n't believe bib would ever fit 3 year old 
-1	these really cute bottles i liked went sides bottle easy grips a family member used exclusively daughter born problems we actually got hand-me-down bottles addition set , i received baby shower the nipples seemed wonderful i needed something like nipple this largest nipple i 've ever seen really mimics breast it softish , pliable texture so i started supplementing formula , i really eager try unfortunately , baby tried hard latch unsuccessful attempts when attach , 'd formula dripping face he 'd cry frustrated so , i ca n't use right now but , i like i n't need toss bottles yet i may able wait need faster flow ( i using slow flow nipples newborns , btw ) or , i may able replace sippie cup lid even better so sit son ready change 
-1	i purchased tubing replace tubing came medela pump style advanced only one tubes worked the hole therefore suction i would not purchase tubing company 
-1	i single hung windows metal frames i guess 're aluminum i unable drill necessary holes i used new bit main problem space i needed reach drill deep maybe extra long bit would worked i n't one i tossed locks trash i 'm going buy tried true kind lock clamps edge window frame using thumb screws 
-1	while product help son reach water , pretty flimsy water collects rather pouring completely keep top cleaning n't get gross also son thinks fun fling extra water washes hands 
-1	i gave 2 year old easter , 2 weeks ago they already broken , screw fell one side plus , & # 34 ; babiators & # 34 ; logo sides already coming ( they send new pair registered pay shipping ) i 'm going fix eyeglass kit , cheaper shipping new pair i wo n't buying , though carters sells similar glasses $ 5 my daughter got pair easter basket well - still one piece i 'm going stick cheaper brand bottom line : unless brand name means something , buy something cheaper versus disappointed , like i , i spent $ 20 something broke 2 weeks 
-1	first , n't get right product we ordered junior glasses lime light received big kid glasses angel blue second , not worth money ! they look like cheap plastic glasses belong toy box the lenses may good , i n't know , frame flimsy we decided not keep ordered different brand 
-1	i originally loved i first got used store emergency diaper kit car however , really n't much fit outside pocket without making bag look lumpy stretched ( example , diaper cream tube ) the material also heavy duty , good thing , makes clunky wrap everything in also , repeated washes gentle cycle front loading washing machine cold water ( air dried ) , something happened zipper making impossible zip back change pad rendering bag pretty useless i love jonathan adler pattern though - super cute ! 
-1	this product nice idea n't securely hold sippy cup well in fact , sippy cup would come straps the sippy cup n't even full 's 6oz cup i would n't buy 
-1	im not really fan car seat for one , doesnt fit top part cart grocery store know '' not supposed '' , lets face , everyone really annoys me i also find hard get base almost never get first time/in one motion oh frickin heavy heavy the thing like 's cute b-ready stroller ( love ) 's not bad seat , clean easy -- -but 4th child better seats past 
-1	very disappointed quality design for example , attempting adjust level ( angle ) seat base absurdly challenging you push downward button point fear breaking horrible engineering and locked given seat level ( angle ) , seat base sloppy rather tightly locked , resulting baby rocking forward backward slop ( looseness ) seat level ( angle ) adjustment mechanism to make long story short , mounting engagement seat base cheap design update : the main ( front ) bow canopy constantly pulling pivot assemblies ( left right sides ) n't `` lock '' solidly reconnecting time consuming annoyance the straps pain neck if i 4 hands , two extra hold straps apart i place child seat , i could manage removing child seat extremely difficult , owing `` deep v '' shape essentially , baby 's sitting hole the baby 's not crazy severe angle either this seat mix good bad , issues unacceptable i see immature engineering refined mass production 
-1	terrible like bottles , flimsy nipple causes leaking even used notch like instructed collapses feeding not baby 's favorite 
-1	these awful bottles go i ca n't count number cracked , split , yellowed point uselessness couple months 
-1	i really wanted love bottle i like feel hand i like n't shake formula get mix but - huge one - broke less week 's worth use my husband struggled close cap passed , went i like bottle much i went scavenger hunt another could n't find one i took sign 
-1	i really liked bottle first , runs dishwasher sterilizing bag serious problems emerged i think low-quality materials warped bit heat , parts become leaky the fact assembling bottle requires pulling nipple bottle rim *just* right n't help , especially considering fact sometimes takes tries pros : - formula wand unique feature , though i n't know much really helps- formula storage caps availablecons : - large , clunky , oddly-shaped parts bit hassle straight-forward avent brand -leaky- poor quality plastic warps easily ( i accidently sterilized one bag water completely melted smoldered no brand i 've used harmed making mistake ) -ounce markings twist diagonally around bottle make measuring needlessly difficult- nipple sits atop flat surface rather rounded dome like bottles rounded shapes simulate baby latches breast , bottle may difficult breastfed baby use-larger bottles 's harder bring many diaper bag 
-1	these bottles terrible many reviewers complained leaking said u use bottle directed , notch , would n't leak i still problem , bottle used exactly directed , leaking the nipple flimsy , causes leaking issue not keep good contact screw lid attaches bottle it also collapses baby drinking , self feeding assisted feeds i stop pull back continue definitely not favorite bottle my baby i prefer cheap gumdrop bottles gumdrop basic parts perfect size little hands inexpensive these bottles big around 
-1	babies different tastes sister returned work ( post grad school ) quite brands choose bought few this bottle one we loved formula mixer included i 've not seen feature that end pros bottle when 's shaken formula leaks bottle cap leaks bottle 's cap got hands i 'd made 2 oz bottle test not good we always go bottles use work well 're a bottle leaks bad n't going make diaper bag also cap comes way easy i would 've liked try formula cap not find anywhere internet i 'm not willing pay shipping try perhaps cap not leak i like playtex 's drop ins bottle cap n't leak 
-1	the price quite reasonable , i figured i would give try the first month used bottles worked great - ordered ton shortly started terrible time leaking , despite & # 34 ; smartclose & # 34 ; feature they would leak nipple nipple ring after stopped using i noticed infant 's gas dramatically decreased stopped using we never used & # 34 ; easymix & # 34 ; mixing paddles , either , since parts clean we ended switching back playtex ventaire bottles first child could n't happier 
-1	i initially liked feel bottle ease flow nipple-much better flow others i reviewed thus far i appreciated able `` see '' closed lining blue arrows bottle opening plastic ring i get little impatient since harder open i 'm busy used opening bottles one hand arm when performing similar task , i pass bottle older daughter open however , nipple another matter-you easily grab , pulling whole thing ! this bottle designed `` u '' shaped indentation base nipple pokes ring this space yields frustratingly leaky bottle , aside fact whole nipple easily removed top also , mixing paddle ( attached inner ring within bottle ) n't work well us powder remnants plastered inside bottom thankfully , 's removable , still ca n't get past rest unfortunately , i not recommend 
-1	my daughter prefers evenflo airvent bottles/nipples i thought looked similar would good time switch since 're using formula the bottles supposed made specifically help mix formula/water better-it little spatula shaped rubber thing sits bottle help mix , n't really work adds another thing clean ! the nipple big daughter n't like the bottle wide 10 month old hard time holding overall , i would n't bother these-similac makes great formula , stick b/c bottles not good ! update : i dropped bottle ( wood floor ) full milk bottom completely cracked broke so 's not durable at all either ! 
-1	the bottle seems well made , in-bottle mixer keeps clumps staying together , daughter n't latch nipple she not like bottle , , may , shame seeing order bottle go waste so far 've using medela playtex bottles , work fine 
-1	i hate bottle i purchased bottle 's slightly expensive price wal mart basically , bottle sucks overly complex top leaks i spent way much time trying screw capon distracting crying baby i hate hate hate bottle leaks leaks leaks ! do not buy ! 
-1	i wish i could give zero stars i purchased local walmart i gave five month old chew it 's not favorite teether , uses time time i guess got far enough back lodged throat induced gagging choking i immediately pulled , already started vomiting started gagging choking vomitus the whole ordeal trying stabilize lasted 10 minutes he turned red one point could not breath we called ems thankfully , better time got it 's supposed help back teeth , goes far enough back induce gagging vomiting it choking hazard ! i 've emailed company called i waiting call back this product not safe babies i not recommend 
-1	did n't work i expected it similar moby wrap ( style ) half wide i used twice the material also like old gym uniform , shiny stuff 
-1	i sure many people may like item i n't like i n't feel secure baby pain put together i n't give much time effort though may work i prefer front baby carrier instead 
-1	we moby wrap i absolutely love , , comparison : the moby extremely soft cotton like thick t-shirt the downside lot cotton , 's heavy & hot however , baby & mom comfy overall this one , comparison , net material ( maybe nylon ? ) it 's not stretchy , itchy/rough my baby hates touching skin , i 'm not big fan touching mine either because 's not stretchy & soft , digs everywhere crosses body , stays extremely tight this kind defeats reason i got instead standard baby carrier ( i hate digging shoulders ) so , comfort , i 'd give low 1 score 1-5 i will give : 's lightweight , breathable 's mesh , regard , gets maybe 3 that i would n't buy i used , not fun experience i 'll suck & deal heavy hot moby day keep son i comfort 
-1	those tubes made ends wide end like one fits pump the original medela ones one wide end , one slim end fit shield because tube comes breastshield time pumping not good buy 
-1	my mom got car seat car i would n't deal dragging mine airport one year old traveling it took 45 minutes install rear facing never secure i tried everything i read instructions , yet would move significant amount side side i even two airport workers help amd couldnt get stop moving around the fabric cheap seems uncomfortable the straps huge pain adjust nothing protect little legs pinched buckling i never felt like daughter safe seat i felt sick drove anywhere avoided going many places i cringed thought putting daughter thing next time i drag car seat , stroller , boba baby carrier , 3 bags , diaper bag airport avoid using piece crap please spend little get better seat , dollars saved not worth peace mind lose using flimsy seat 
-1	these containers worst dry erase system possible i able use first time , band either rubbed marker would n't erase i could update contents date i tried contact company directly n't even bother reply , clearly not interested customers happy recommend product honestly , save money i ended buying jarred organic food , using periodically reused glass jars much greater success 
-1	this bad , zipper really bad it velcro ( scratchy side ) one side seems useless i pacifier pouches immensely better 
-1	i would n't bother purchasing unless feel strongly child tray it sits far away child - , 's awkward even 2 5 y/o reach ( perhaps made apparent seats b-agile n't sit completely upright ? ) also , cup holder small none cups seem fit ( i imagine must , none gerber , nuk , munchkin cups ) we never even bothered opening second one purchased since pretty underwhelmed first if 2 5 y/o struggles use , way younger sister find useful 
-1	i 'm mystified product positive reviews its canopy , stroller already canopy i bought expecting would somehow cover stroller normal canopy britax nothing comes free stroller itself i 'm disappointed also disappointed seller ( baby ) insisting i pay return this not amazon standards usual experience amazon sellers 
-1	i bought shade factor since i live south florida sunny nearly every day ! well , first day used sun penetrated right little one 's face i 100 % disappointed ! maybe i received defective one ? but mine not work sunshade , however work rain guard , 50 % worth i not discarded packaging i would returned ! save packaging u get defective one ! so , i use big umbrella i take little one walks block sun good luck 
-1	my husband i tried use shade constantly blew back windy days thereby defeating purpose it not 'firm ' enough withstand even breeze really we tried attaching every way keep stable could n't get work well not mention , son really likes look around blocks view lot i 'm still looking good solution sun issue ! 
-1	i ordered product confidence given number 4 5 star reviews i found product not easily repositionable peeled paint walls in addition , diagram package not helpful determining tree pieces belong i ended making design came okay end i giving 1 star i know i repaint room 
-1	i bought first baby i excited put as soon got home hospital first thing i hated i tried every days , different settings , got screaming response it n't move fast enough at even fastest setting so slow i n't see soothes baby so put away got back second baby ( 12 months later ) i thought sure easy going baby would love since everyone else seemed rave , nope , response he hated , it simply n't move fast enough not mention fabric stiff not least bit comforting we put fleece blanket try make appealing nothing not mention mobile completely useless it n't even move we ended getting traditional cradle swing kids loved so much 
-1	despite smart design bottles ( nipple sized shaped similar breast , bottle comfortable hold , bottle compatible pumps ) , i would not purchase invariably , fast leak lids frustrating mess they worthless feeding storage 
-1	these suppose create less gas baby , little girl n't like the nipple new structure finds hard eat i 'm not sure size shape , could try refused go near i would n't buy 
-1	i anxious buy i wanted high quality bottles baby however , using couple times i saw baby drinking leaking life i could n't figure the cap fine , nipple fit also milk managed leak somehow 
-1	these bottles get 2 stars decent quality - leaking issues , volume markings clear outside unfortunately , not natural ( primarily breastfed ) baby 's mouth not work us just looks like breast eye n't mean work every breastfed baby make sure check baby 's latch bottle nipple looks like does/should breast for 6 week old daughter , latch avent natural nipples caused lips curl completely in/under instead flanging the transition tip base abrupt , 's sharp angle worst , frequently choked drinking , rather scary i assume , based overwhelmingly positive reviews , must work many babies just n't make mistake assuming work best every baby ; try multiple bottle nipples find right one baby for us , lansinoh momma bottles 
-1	the glass bottles nice whole bottle useless thanks new nipples our baby tough time maintaining good seal around nipple result milk would spill around neck we initially thought flow rate nipple trying different avent nipples ( slower flow rates ) getting messy results decided return entire bottle set get dr brown 's glass bottle set instead 
-1	theses bottles leaked pretty bad so badly i sent back i read great reviews bottles heavy tops leaked 
-1	if buy medela quick steam bags really n't needed - everything go steam bag , dishwasher , washed hand it 's bulky literally n't used 
-1	returned bc i thought easy bottle cleaning directions tell wash bottles thoroughly steaming w item thus 's point ? i guess 're ocd want extra sterile would like ? ? ? double trouble not worth time 
-1	way thin useful these see , shrunk wash n't absorb anything my intention use burp cloths , not chance 
-1	these make awful diapers they thin hold nothing whatsoever maybe layered diapers would okay , not soft i would n't want baby 's sensitive skin they n't bad burp cloths still n't work good flannel ones if washed correctly , good cleaning n't leave lint behind 
-1	super thin ! i returned immediately knowing could n't absorbent i wanted burp cloths found not soft i want something much comfortable skin 
-1	we 've got number prefold cloth diapers 've used burp cloths general wipe - 're way better real burp cloths , absorbent picked pack gerber brand tonight babies r us - 'll going right back soon they 're horrible - thin gauze , non absorbent , terrible were i using diapers , i 'd deathly afraid child would leak everywhere they ca n't hold anything , since barely exist ! ugh 
-1	i meant purchase & # 34 ; gauze & # 34 ; style thicker absorbent & # 34 ; birdseye & # 34 ; style these also smaller , i would definitely recommend getting gauze we use time burp cloths baby reflux ! 
-1	these thin not i expected i using burp cloths i would returned i not already wash baby born 
-1	the older version great we half dozen use burp cloths messes they 're great everything except actual diapering so , daughter came along , natural add registry the new ones nothing like old ones they made flimsy , gauzy material actually transparent right light they absorb nothing tear slightest tug i would rate slightly better paper towels we 've already gotten rid 
-1	these overpriced quantity quality they first buy cloth diapers purchasing make burp cloths they work i using never purchase ones 
-1	like posts- i use decorate give baby gifts i thought i would save bucks go 5-ply thinking 's difference 5 6 ply anyway ? ( i usually buy premium 6-ply gerber $ 4 amazon ) i bought up- flimsy see side panels i wo n't able give away gifts low quality take advice- pay extra 6-ply purchase babies r us brand they nice thick well 
-1	super thin i use burp cloths i disappointed thin even though 3 ply i continue get baby r us brand much thicker 
-1	these great burp cloths not use diapers ! the `` absorbent '' batting middle comparison real cotton prefolds , like green mountain diapers your baby soak right gerber `` diapers '' probably not want cloth diaper anymore regal prefolds pretty inexpensive also , want try cloth diapering , research ! try green mountain diapers diaper rite 
-1	this monitor made low clicking noise every 20 seconds use even lowest volume setting without baby noise background noise sound lights flickering constantly i could n't keep monitor misleading something going baby 's room fact perfectly quiet we tried switching locations directions camera monitor nothing helped i could n't find way adjust sound sensitivity the video quality good otherwise disappointed model 
-1	i done thorough internet search not find diapers manufactured i see backup gots organic certification they smell chemical coming package i excited use i 'm not going even prep they going back 
-1	i could n't use return due fact straps n't adjustable the part crib wraps around attach thicker straps n't even come close closing not cribs straps n't able adjusted bad design

-1	i really wanted velvet baby hangers , great bargain ! unfortunately , seemed cheap i returned starting shed & # 34 ; velvet & # 34 ; material first day i got disappointing 
-1	this chair total disappointment since first got son it sturdy durable , major drawbacks especially comes cleaning pros : -folds easily stores nicely-has two removeable tray tops not clean entire tray meal-very adjustable ( caveat see cons ) -tray easy put removecons : -tray large- much large child 's normal portion food cup- because tray large , not fit standard sized dishwasher ( despite 'dishwasher safe ' ) -the chair padding not washed easily- chair made 'wipe ' material easy cleaning made something machine washable -the cushions chair labeled 'hand wash ' major inconvenience -the shoulder pads - get dirty almost every meal - removable disassembling straps -these shoulder pads velco snap allow easy removal cleaning - despite otherwise adjustable , recline fixed chair as result , not set child sitting fully upright the chair always reclined 
-1	i received gift i 'm returning this basically tv for baby insanity ! this products like turn kids brains mush and personally i blame kind push button lights flash , loud toys huge factor incline kids inability focus , need instant gratification sense entitlement chose kids toys wisely 
-1	i excited receive product i expected hit 2 1/2 year old 12 month old ( product description suggests 's appropriate 0-24 months ) , however , 's disappointment us for young baby , 's likely fine enough product place crib passive entertainment baby watches entertaining soothing applications , though , someone else already said review , makes seems lot like baby television since american academy pediatrics recommends television children age 2 , seems bconnect digital soother n't good idea either there interactive component product children scroll advance two applications , however , 's also large button front product activates nightlight feature pushed this feature major design flaw - baby toddler 's interacting toy going push large yellow button unintentionally bring entertainment halt greeted night light turned pushing button again i particularly looking forward feature enables use memory card display personal photos thought would great car trips unfortunately , i never able get one memory cards successfully work product overall , 's overpriced plastic product my recommendation purchase rotating mobile - likely bigger hit ( educational ) baby 
-1	this seat tiny ! i opened box , put together thought , oh , one play doll seats ? oops , i thought baby ! my daughter isnt big , barely fits she looks ridiculous sitting it looks like giant baby sitting dollhouse seat : ) the backrest barely goes middle back she 16 months old , 30 '' , i dont think could fit toddler its best 6 months if baby small size sit yes , inexpensive , like always say , get pay ! i keep take restaurants , get regular sized one kitchen table also , toy attaches easily pops right , , gets tossed floor right away ! no suprise , though , giant baby sitting seat ! ! ! 
-1	i bought bouncer 4 month old daughter i wanted another seating option besides swing boppy lounger i thought bouncer good concept interactive toy design however , i put together bouncer let daughter sit , i saw could n't even really reach monkey butterfly toys top she also could n't get push pull feature toy bars i n't know 's still young knows bat toys seemed like got bored quickly sitting staring toys could n't play perhaps older baby may like better according bouncer description , n't use baby sit 's way i see baby able reach high toys also , music monkey sounds comes move one handles gets really annoying awhile it would good button music rather remove battery lastly , i thought toy bars could moved sides easily take baby chair n't that means lift child top slide legs toys not big deal another annoying part toy design i ended returning bouncer n't worth money badly executed design toys 
-1	we got product registry our son nightmare car screams whole time we tried install could see could see there way us install way see we hatchback headrest center seat car there velcro option 's not right length on top , remote not work this waste money plus music annoying ( tolerance high ) find another product 
-1	i really wanted like item it 's made fisher-price generally means stand test time it bright colorful cute zoo animals front caught attention least however , i really wish i gone baby einstein mirror really mirror one reasons i outline below pros:1 ) it 's bright pretty2 ) the songs entertaining lights cool the music plays approximately 10 minutes 3 ) it setting control lights music , music , etc handy 4 ) the mirror part large -- help see baby better 5 ) it comes remote control turn sounds front seat ( see cons -- important ) cons:1 ) the single annoying thing mirror lack stability it velcro straps secure place onto headrest sounds good , right ? well way velcro , hit one little tiny bump ( say speed bump pothole ) entire mirror shifts suddenly moves place in nutshell , not secure in order make truly secure need better straps velcro , something it terrible design put straps first place 2 ) the remote great idea problem , works wants sometimes remote works , 75 % time , n't matter many times hit giant button you see , driving freeway , holding hand behind trying kinds different angles get music turn back up , , side , upside -- nope nothing then i 'll wait minutes try , randomly work oh put sensor remote control bottom mirror , high seat angle mirror odd angle sitting ( see baby better ) , wo n't hit sensor i note not problem remote -- i literally hold remote next mirror stopped still suffers problem working wants to 3 ) the music -- okay one hand , playing 10 minutes awesome -- stops if remote worked correctly , could start everyone happy instead , daughter meltdowns freeway music stops i ca n't get start back i 'm traffic pulling check restart toy takes away whole point mirror first place worse , 90 % time , i 've hit bump road changed lanes , mirror place , i way knowing baby crying something genuinely wrong 's upset music stopped very frustrating ultimately , i really regret spending money i really wanted like , i 'm wishing i bought baby einstein one instead ( control long music plays ) instead , i 'll probably break go pick velcro strips try make mirror least stay put i would suggest try buy see works car maybe 'll better luck

-1	we comparably priced summer infant video monitor , purchase second remote device ( hand-held device screen ) remote dropped much when opportunity try one came , i jumped idea ! we iphones ipads handy almost time , sounded ideal not much summary : setup easy video lack-luster , sound meh crackly the internet aspect slows things moment try log quality user experience severely limited internet involvement setup : software : app install quick easy camera : set annoying not terrible you make account server , even want stream within house and configure camera network ( involves camera starting default network , joining network phone , configuring camera join network switching back network phone ) that went well instructions clear login : i find takes forever app log it 's annoying unnecessary it also means not run exclusively locally even want if lose internet , probably lose baby monitor ( i not test , personally ) video : the video quality camera poorer summer infant one the night vision works , makes room crib look hazy , like dark , smokey bar ( summer infant 's makes look like surveillance tape , 's clearer easier discern 's ) both cameras use infrared leds night vision during day , 's ok , still not clear summer infant camera the picture looked much better phones tablets - resolution n't larger images the zoom digital , 's not actually useful ( pixels , larger ! ) switching high low quality made visible difference sound : i could not get rid crackly static noise camera i tried different rooms , different angles also , i could not get push-to-talk work there slight delay - maybe 2 beats - sound video controls : there 's definitely delay pressing button move camera camera moving loss connection : if camera loses connection , device 're monitoring beep loudly it 's nice beep - like industrial elevator beep - still quite loud just n't want hear middle night , right ? we try connecting offsite easy also slow video clunky point plus 's expensive the room temperature display kind neat , not nearly enough make short-comings conclusion : there tests could done small amount testing turned enough clunkiness decided n't us

-1	i n't think comfortable efficient medela flanges in fact , i think 're awkward i still ca n't sit comfortably pumping angled shape flange , n't hold breast like medela flanges also , i 'm annoyed comes packs 3 sizes i use one size ( making two sets useless waste money ) stick medela flanges 
-1	i really excited get start using them i n't find anymore comfortable medela flanges came pump i actually think makes whole flange/bottle combination annoyingly bulky i not see increase milk production reviewers said i hopeful fall love product get increase production not impressed 
-1	this big bracelet anklet daugher it not work i necklace & bracelt ( necklace doubled ) hoping would help sleep teething the thing worked teething tablets & tylenol she wore one month 24/7 
-1	did n't help son ! kept falling ankle , would pinch , nothing colic 
-1	what seem overall all-in-one gadget actually pretty useless comes practical use we 8 week old baby tried use product actively order make use features observed following : - feeding diary feature useless since many apps days keep full log baby 's feeding activities like sleeping , diaper change etc whenever feed baby , not possible keep looking gadget feed time iphone app comes handy purpose there one similac useful indeed - time/clock not visible feet away due small font size weird color combination black dark blue lit screen - when used aaa size batteries , eats fast when connected power cable limits positioning device - nightlight feature distracting trying make baby sleep light catchy simulates mind instead relaxing he keeps looking eyes wide open instead sleeping - there wall mount feature seriously ? so either keep near crib changing station either case usability goes due distance bed overall , inconvenient poorly designed product high cost 
-1	i high hopes lots research , clunky stiff its even uglier bulkier person not much added features we returned , decided go britax b-agile it folds differently , smaller joovy little lighter joovy hard open close , storage tiny ! britax b-agile close one hand holding baby , fit huge diaper bag storage maneuvers joovy everytime , not mention canopy larger great looking stroller way less $ $ dont go joovy stroller , joovy playyard playyard2 , perfect wonderful , joovy great company , needs stick play yards 
-1	we used older virsion munchkin sippy cups infant son around 8 months old started drinking sippy cups that version silicone top like , liked fine as teething , would chew tips , eventually tops became chewed pretty much useless -- plastic began chipping ( never choking hazard , something may want think ) so tossed , started giving cup straw , see 'd that now , 13 months , regularly uses straw sippy cup loves it 's not greatest cup , ( 's something going straw causes leaks , i 'm pretty sure something pressure physics i n't fully understand ) likes i deal witht mess still , i thought , let 's try one ( free amazon vine program ) click lock function help prevent spills , fine silicone sippy cup well , tried , threw across room disgust , difficult get liquid spout so 's that that said , 're looking transitional cup bottle , i think 're worth try they pretty leak proof , 's probably want but , cup kid 's bit far along drinking-from-a-cup stage , may tough -- pretty hard suck liquid ( i tried ) 
-1	these bottle produce mildew picture hello kitty green i 've couple months

-1	i received baby shower gift registry i read reviews negatives n't fit crib well fit crib fine , craftsmanship mobile not really par the bird top cloth covering i thought actual plush the birdie perched branch lopsided the branch lopsided and kicker ? the mobile plays different melody brahms stated box the mobile i plays something sounds like twinkle twinkle little star , i actually google brahms lullaby make sure i going crazy hearing wrong melody i wanted return told since i opened assembled , i wo n't able i 'm stuck 
-1	what photo not show packaging -- clearly labels ice packs & # 34 ; adult use & # 34 ; i n't really expect kindergartener try take bite , given mixed reviews regarding durability , i not confident trusting judgement handle bag break leak frustrated information given description kid focused clearly , packaging , green sprouts n't comfortable saying okay kids ' lunchboxes 
-1	i generally like green sprouts products happy sterilized water inside vs sort mysterious possibly unsafe gel , outer skin overfilled water 're firm not invitingly chewy teething 5 month old baby my son bores easily , even chilled i also received markedly different shape teether pictured they look like thin donuts 5 equally sized nubs one side , nothing like little hands i would happily overlooked teethers functionally successful 
-1	the waterproof covering thin punctures easily once torn , material underneath reminds old styrofoam trays meat packed i bought store i read amazon reviews ( others warned lack durability ) i upgraded baby care play mat ( made rubber , flexible , durable ) much better product 
-1	great idea , not hold we 6mo old wanted use baby gate saw snag cover material morning thought maybe gate messed well come find little man scooting pulls plastic top foam rips , leaving fun flaps plastic loves pull the cats walking left dotted holes well very disappointing no idea one could expect use toddler 
-1	i got bathtub munchkin ducky got small , i found one local store yes roomier , yes baby likes it , but , three times little bottom slipped almost got underwater , husband and yes , cautious comes safety baby this never happened munchkin one non slippery bottom why hard make two additional things tub , , , not slippery bottom drainer ! ? ! ? really ? its hard ? one would think baby product would make consider safety if i , i would buy munchkin one this one bad possible hazard safety little one 
-1	so far toddler refuses sleep it may waste money since not comfortable

-1	the mirror soft bendy , gives distorted reflection makes dizzy i would n't recommend 
-1	bought product granddaughters highchair , chair older model sadly not fit 
-1	i excited bumper worked first couple weeks started sagging my son bumping head crib time it 's little big crib i 've trying make work even places 's not bunching still sags the quality not great i wish i could return i 've already washed i not recommend bumper 
-1	our pediatrician told us return item due item danger child bad physical development 
-1	i really wanted like walker , room2 play yard also joovy really happy it after ordering amazon , rec 'd walker scuff marks , scratched looked dirty ! the replacement i rec 'd also damaged ! i figured i would suck keep liked found putting seat onto walker incredibley onerous annoying n't worth keeping i know i assembling correctly i called customerservice help anthony answered right away confirmed i right seemed concerned fact i kept getting damaged merchandise amazon ( fair ) the walker good looking simple sleek design returned refund on top damaged i realized way attach toys twins not interested i n't want deal seat took forever get off overall whole experience really disappointing made wary buying larger items amazon i n't know damage happening shipping ( even though box looked fine ) amazon shipping returned damaged goods 
-1	we n't like baby carrier complicated use , takes long learn use baby n't feel comfortable we tried figuring videos people using , advertising videos , instruction manual in beginning learning careful likely 'll need help another person it looks easy video , n't we quick learners figure things easily this baby carrier difficult figure use after trying 1h send back simply n't work our newborn n't fee comfortable baby 's head n't getting support needed we highly recommend following baby carrier : babyhawk mei tai baby carrier it well priced , easy use hold baby 40 lbs 
-1	i 've owned carrier eight months i 'm getting rid based upon positive reviews , works majority not i hesitant spend lot money carrier based upon much research , i convinced one after seven children , i 've tried many carriers not say i favorite , yet most carriers cons one way many continue use first , birth , i could never get baby 's face stay she always managed turn inward matter i adjusted everything that made nervous i afraid could n't breath i support head sling one arm inconvenient uncomfortable as baby grew , i used carrier less 's 8 months , i ca n't bare sling longer 20 minutes i 'm always adjusting rides neck weight baring one shoulder hurts ! i n't see anyone could carry toddler thing the instructions make seem easy pull sling little opposite shoulder tighten , 's not easy it 's versatile i like i could nurse staying covered multitasking , but alone n't worth price i really could n't use long i toggled back forth carrier infantino sash mei tai carrier the infantino carrier n't really useful newborn stage , child grows , 's much supportive , comfortable cheaper i ca n't recommend spending much money carrier n't comfortable months 
-1	i like look , fit ease cloth trainers one snaps broke i unsnapping insert so , useless ( i ca n't get insert stay place without snaps ) major bummer ! 
-1	this pump okay not great it quiet works well but flang n't fit properly n't give size choice i n't bother trying find another size spectra since painful even wrong size however get milk medela hand pump first it 's good pump , not 
-1	for price 's not worth i really trying find walker swivel wheels i guess n't make anymore only front wheels spin 360 degrees back ones go forward/backward kind hard babies understand mechanics first car , i mean i told going 4 point turn get corner n't & # 34 ; get & # 34 ; also , indentions back plastic imagine rear car lights , etc well n't even provide stickers ( like plastic toys ) also rear view mirror , could cute mirror like silver sticker , leave black boring if 's afraid babies get wet peel , one sticker already little play tray not give ? i returned walker refund looking alternative i also received black car instead red the red looks cooler 
-1	the way tentacles curl inward close giant head make impossible actually toss rings onto tentacles , plus fact rings exact size tentacles room error ( picture shows striped ring hanging tentacle , rings much smaller holes exact size tentacle ) it 's much smaller i thought would , although i admit i not read dimensions to give idea , hole center star fits thumb it 's cute floating octopus , without ring toss , n't really anything my 1 year old 3year pretty much ignore tub but seems good quality i like bath toy collect water inside get mildewy gross 
-1	this way small price also seemed like kid could knock check super panel playyard price extensions much cheaper ! 
-1	the connecting parts units serve perfect little ladders baby climb fall and suction cups n't stick floor so 17 lb baby strong enough push whole play yard wherever wants ! do n't waste money unsafe structure 
-1	not worth money us my son 10 months waking around cried soon i put ! maybe started young ? very cute takes lot space 
-1	i really excited bottles water kept leaking formula compartment i tried couple would leak water formula compartment i n't notice right away i went wash bottles saw formula clumped bottom formula container i returned 
-1	if develop thrush using protect clothing yeast/medication make infection much worse hold moisture this led large acne-like rashes next areola foul smell this without added moisture lactation if used solely leakage , still would n't buy the plastic hard open , i cut open scissors daily for clothing protection i much prefer nuk ultra thin pads they n't wrapped additional plastic , price great n't cause moisture buildup they worked well fir lactation also and not noticeable clothing johnson 's medela also preferable brand 
-1	i hard time letting electric pump i thought manual might better , i even worse success manual i actually found one pretty uncomfortable times painful i think insert shield blame super uncomfortable , i still n't success removing it n't work 
-1	i started daughter nuby super straw easy grippers i think accustomed , difficult use maybe i started , would n't issue 
-1	i brushed complaints cup leaked it not seals , straw this cup leaves ring milk wherever put and light suck straw bring rush liquid mouth the extra cost weighted straw not worth mess 
-1	my son actually loves cup wanted carry around everywhere unfortunately also loved chewing straw ripped open top days use i 'll admit son chewer i think quality straw material made durable , would taken much longer wear aside straw issue , logo cup began rubbing one hand washing one thing bugged hourglass shape cup actually interferes weighted straw works when weighted part straw slides backward cup tipped , actually get hung middle cup indentation , making difficult straw bottom reach pool liquid so , i 'm pretty disappointed trying zoli cup 
-1	this cup states leak proof , son could not even drink without leaking horribly he not turning upside anything crazy , tipping slightly drink it- immediately fairly large stream water would leak lid cup screw together i thought surely i lid incorrectly- repeated attempts using cup , continues leak horribly i returning today 
-1	this cup hard clean leaks i standard straw cleaning brush i ca n't fit straw it 's great concept not executed well 
-1	my wife i welcomed first child almost two months ago jumped opportunity try fisher-price apptivity gym as far kids toys go i 'm fence introducing electronic stimulation early son 's life realize decision parent make we compatible apple itouch assembling toy i try one itunes apps called 'peek-n-play ' i 'll refrain reviewing app i never let son play wife i decided using itouch toy assembly : putting little toy together really easy the included instructions exactly one sheet paper the toy entirely comprised interlocking plastic pieces plastic snaps hold two half-loops onto top portion hanging toys your itouch/iphone fits plastic compartment back , rear toy there built-in screen protector would hopefully prevent anything damaging electronic device quality : as might guess less $ 50 n't particularly well-built toy i still found toy surprisingly unstable ; though fischer price 's credit include two nylon safety straps legs since toy intended used child laying his/her back underneath toy stability issue little disconcerting also not liking easily hanging toys snap my son managed pull one hard-plastic toys snap entirely came crashing floor next head bottom-line : this inexpensive , seemingly disposable toy potential safety problems my wife i not intend allow child play toy not recommended 
-1	i n't keep chair long enough try i still feel need comment the `` new straps '' long stick much matter much tighten my daughter n't like way stuck front , hitting chin they might easier clean look feel uncomfortable the cover n't cover well there large gaps seat sides i imagine food would always get trapped the tray there way i could use one hand i kneel watch closely putting tray track with five kids , i knew i would n't time back drawing board also , not worth price 
-1	we purchased hopes would get reluctant potty trainer get interested it leaked first 'use ' floor i check make sure parts pieced/fit together correctly tried times it leaked time 
-1	i loved idea , put , bottom part gate still stuck half inch trip guard , might okay using level surface , used bottom stair , still hurt like heck step it also stuck past bottom stair bit 
-1	the metal clip/grip comes product put together it n't intuitive husband tinker bit get right 
-1	having read reviews , i feel need clarify couple things honestly , i read 7 8 reviews use cheesy language ( `` wireless freedom ! '' `` crystal clear sound ! `` ) , written within days , giving product 5 stars , i get really skeptical really fast genuine reviews may - may not - for record , i bought samsung secured target orlando , vacation , sony baby call spent unfortunate evening electrical storm i evaluating samsung based previous use baby call , summer secure sleep , safety first glow & grow , safety first crystal clear 1 ) `` wireless '' half-truth not really advantage anything why ? because baby monitors market right exact dect `` wireless '' technology this monitor works battery , needs plugged regularly charge yes , unplug walk around house day , going use night , need plug run risk dying fast asleep the piece goes child 's room not wireless every basic monitor available right functions way 2 ) sound quality not aspect baby monitor matters this easily quietest monitor i tried thus far what point decent sound quality , ca n't actually hear dishwasher , shower , children ? despite glowing reviews , i found child still sounds far away monitor there n't much true interference , buzz constant matter i try use ( including hotel vacation , home , mother 's house ) i also find annoying receiver takes good 10-15 seconds pair transmitter , every time turn meaning i n't ever instant sound not cool , samsung 3 ) the cost seriously ? it 's standard monitor , advanced functions video capability , yet 2-3x cost comparable units why ridiculous price tag ? ? ? on top issues , i find green lights monitor very bright i turn face away night , lights keep sleeping not pleasant discovery sleep-deprived mother young children especially given already too-quiet monitor even difficult hear facing away bottom line : there actual advantage monitor i tried , fact , falls short experience baby call given inflated price tag , end , really paying name do favor try sony baby call first you see number reviews ( including mine ) mention interference , case sony , ( cases ) simply adjust channel ( opposed samsung , gets loud ) the sound quality really is great , oh yeah - baby call half price 
-1	i wanted like bottle using nightmare it leaked place , every seam , matter position i thought i going crazy who would make bottle poor quality high cost per piece ? i asked iron man husband ( 6'4 '' professional firefighter ) tighten parts make sure i n't going weak still leaked everywhere my mom tried , formula dribbled horribly , even warming cap still bottom once , go ahead get mop geez louise we never actually fed newborn son bottle , i not even comment acceptance rejection nipple i would give zero stars rating option very disappointing , especially price

-1	i 've used twice , i doubt i 'll ever use i read reviews first adiri bottle , good much leaked , i hoped things would little different one that 's not case it leaks , not much , enough regret spending money for price bottles i would expect differently my baby boy seem like , regardless constant feeding interruptions wipe bottle but also took well comotomo , n't leak , 's 're sticking 
-1	i ordered currently use original version adiri nurser bottle , bottle time exclusively breastfed baby would take thank goodness grown past phase take born free bottles i purchased received baby shower gifts this nexgen bottle much trouble all different pieces steps fill heat cumbersome time consuming as busy working mom , i not time they really need rethink design thing it 's also hard read amounts i thought i would love , i like look feel boy i glad i n't actually use long 
-1	i purchased based high reviews suggestion lactation consultant when arrived i eagerly opened started set everything with caring extremely fussy newborn i quickly realized lactation system not too much time consuming set-up clean involved if very patient , stay home mom system might speed if impatient person , i , need something simple quick i 'd steer clear i never even used i pretty much threw towel i realized much involved use thankfully i able nurse baby , even couple minutes time soothe comfort supplement expressed breast milk formula in summary , i not impressed lact-aid nursing trainer would not bought i known much keep the price tag bit much getting , plastic parts pieces i think $ 40- $ 50 would appropriate 
-1	this gift i never thought look reviews she absolutely loves one favorites i took away she bottom teeth less month today i noticed big scratches plastic paint stripes i rubbed finger came stripe green plastic chips ! that going mouth ! i contacting company urge parents stay away product 
-1	there lot i n't like product the main problem upon opening package , i attempted unsnap waist snaps , point two immediately flew oblivion , rendering product completely useless depositing tiny pink choking hazards floor even , i attempted put insert pocket , curiosity i read many reviews product , frequent complaint pocket narrow put anything this true literally i ca n't even fit hand deposit insert , let alone hand and insert if 're looking worthwhile product , sunbaby makes great pocket trainers 
-1	i several , baby & # 34 ; happy spitter & # 34 ; frequent spit episodes we go 6-10 bibs day we first generation , velcro abrasive , stayed better left friction marks babies neck , bought , second generation velcro much softer stops sticking /working washes , i ca n't keep bibs feeds , 's tugs 5 months bottom line , i would buys dozens snapped the thick rim around neck super helpful keeping sneaky spit clothes , velcro issues , worthless i buy aden anis snap bibs instead going forward 
-1	ergo hugely popular lot hype built around brand , i found i pregnant number two i i tried , seemed comfortable enough , i tried infant insert month old hated i tried week later still protested so i waited grow bit could try without insert , still screamed whenever i put i kept several months , trying every week , matter i adjusted ergo i could not get baby comfortable thing other options like infantino babybjorn 's peaceful , ergo hated i finally gave passed another mother hopefully 's luck 
-1	we tried utilize bath support bathe infant twin grandchildren , 8 lbs 12 lbs my daughter-in-law not use discovering not deep enough feel babies securely held , holds little water she ended buying another mfr 's brand cradles baby much better this advertised 30 lbs , i skeptical baby size would even fit 
-1	upon adjustment , mirror slowly shifts 're driving eventually 've lined view , longer viewable centered therefore , returned i not want constantly adjusting mirror car drive ! i actually went back jeep mirror , works better provided straps long enough headrest 
-1	i thought reading reviews would good mirror little one back seat i pretty disappointed see distorts reflection quite bit perfectly angled babies head n't looking 12 inches longer normal it also sensitive movement i 'm finding constantly adjusting i unfortunately purchased months advance 'll work 
-1	box back mirror makes stick several inches seat as , always sliding around moving place i wish i kept box i could send back 
-1	this mirror looks like great concept large viewing surface , two securing straps ( one vertical , one horizontal ) , wide base , adjustable angle when i first installed subaru forester , i thought : `` that might best baby purchase far ! `` then , i started driving discovered mirror ( mounted ball joint ) moves bump road , making useless couple minutes road n't reflect lo anymore there might way fuse mirror ball joint together permanently ( duct tape , super glue , play dough ) i ca n't try i final car seat ( lo still portable car seat ) would 5-star purchase ball joint n't move 
-1	it may cool tilt toward middle get accident , hard surfaces mirror could injure child i 'll stick cheaper soft versions : / 
-1	if leather seats , i n't recommend product in addition , always slants left , i n't get great view son 's face driving 
-1	i think i would better without mirror thing car absolutely ridiculous ! two different moveable points make sure never mirror stay position want , start driving as keeps sliding keep adjusting viewing angle i sure really unsafe maybe duck taping help 
-1	i bought mirror since best reviews big mistake it arrived blue discolorations around rubber top like pen exploded since baby due soon cosmetic , i n't return it installed fine first month worked well it heavy mirror though hard if baby toddler got could smack hurt pretty bad after month mirror started tilt side i constantly adjusting go back straight the mechanism behind mirror ball socket obviously loosened there 's way tighten it annoying straighten every time i got baby car fall crooked yet drive i ended buy new mirror since i bought one months ago i ca n't return trash went 
-1	this mirror ridiculous first , mirror way big and reviewers correct looks like child middle earthquake so much distracting driving vibration back this item immediately returned amazon 
-1	the distortion 'mirror ' really drag ( 's mirror laminate plastic backing course , due safety issues real glass hanging baby 's head moving car ) like looking funhouse mirror back seat 
-1	the mirror always moves we try secure , seems move not impressed product 
-1	moms not use garbage mine grew yeast could caused major problem since gels meant placed directly contact nipple , baby drinking i always cleaned mine extremely well every use allowed dry every time this product major hazard not sold shame ameda selling i glad i saw problem placing c*** breast 
-1	this nice product , compartments tiny barely holds enough snacks 21 month old great concept , wish compartments little bigger

-1	i wanted love product i really tired velcro diaper bag waking baby every time i opened the bad news , n't work my bag not stay closed strength magnets maybe stronger bottom line , i 'd rather bag stays shut bag super quiet 
-1	the nipple brush perfect nipples like medela , evenflo however bottle prush design not good the sponge al , ost impossible get narrow neck bottle without squeezing assistance , sponge bottle rarely scrapes reaches bottom bottle milk residue builds 
-1	the design quite sweet , i purchased place bunch items baby shower gift basket it work fine purpose , long term use , not sturdy playroom nursery probably not worth money i not return i need shower ! i ordered skip hop items -- amazon -- use sturdy , quite surprised lack quality item

-1	so poor glider/ottoman shipped az , traveled nm , arrived city co , reason went back nm , back co finally arrived doorstep the box seen better days , i still n't think 's blame the ottoman damaged pulled packaging - large crack wood base we offered option return entire product , glider , already set hassle return box ship out also , glider grinding noise every time moves - n't matter sitting , 's grind forward/grind back if baby distracted noises , not best option overall , purchased color , i happy everything else ? feels like waste money 
-1	if i could give zero stars , i would ! it poorly made cheap i guess get pay ! the wood joints squeak matter 's very annoying rocking baby ! what waste money -- regret purchase ! ! 
-1	i received glider ottoman put together the back chair crack/split wood extends hole screw first peg all pegs back creek loudly every movement feels though break i 'm 150lbs ( 8 months pregnant ) feels insecure the chair also strong smell paint this surprises considering 's quiet spots n't even painted well probably could used another coat paint allowed dry packaging there 's also splinters parts wood holes drilled in the cushions comfortable , one back 2 stain spots it assembly easy thing needed put together back arm rests everything else pre-assembled box i contacting storkcraft directly see i least get replacement back chair i would give higher rating would eliminate load creaking sound chair makes would make useless trying rock baby sleep i update review rating depending things go 
-1	this nice sound machine lasts the projector usually stops working months we begun buying pairs expecting break , always basically disposable item 
-1	i months sudden , turning part projection quit working the actual projection works , images n't turn not worth $ 26

-1	i pretty disappointed got - padding fairly thin reason , back not straight it 's hard describe , pretty much , back slanted ( front back direction ) , even though chair otherwise felt solid the slant back , however , meant padding not cover certain parts correctly , fabric wood my husband i kind puzzled bit see could remedy back , returned the green brighter would expect based picture , spring green , not quite neon ( described another reviewer ) 
-1	i ordered diaper pail i love charlie banana os cloth diapers i used straight box first poopy diaper i rinse leaked right diaper pail the zipper bottom mine ( n't make much sense ) water came right corner if zipper not bottom , i 'm sure would work fine thank figure 8 maternity giving full refund ! i ordered planet wise pail liners put trash instead

-1	thin legs leaks every time boy maybe would good girl 
-1	i like pocket diaper trim lining supersoft it good daytime use , trim hard double stuff nite time use we used diaper week six months , yet elastic one legs already broken 
-1	this worked perfectly 2 months yesterday tubing came apart connector base unfortunately , choice purchase another one quality seller , medela makes close impossible get anywhere else 
-1	got thought would love turns hurts , brand makes good carrier people past size 10 unlike ergo loved fact fit could fit bigger person not think say air breathable baby ended sweating allot unlike ergo padding support belt yeah convenient not want comfortable carrying baby also pushes baby theighs ergo almost point cutting circulation not us 8 month old size one year old tall big baby not fat

-1	we ordered wanting use preemie discharged nicu thinking 'd give us peace mind home what mistake- despite reading instructions watching video online , still went randomly hours plus monitor clipped diaper snugly left little guy skin chaffing must uncomfortable him we returned

-1	this temperature reading camera 3 4 degrees higher temperature actually room 
-1	pros : -it 's placemat cons : -does n't stick wood tables ( i n't think would problem since hook-on high chair would secure table , since n't lay flat sits table due suction cups underneath , curious 7-month-old spent every meal pulling edges trying figure get mouth ) -the cutesy little design raised making zillion nooks crannies food get stuck n't run whole thing water immediately using ( not practical hook-on high chair ) -the reservoir n't interface well hook-on high chair , n't interface bjorn soft bibs -does n't lay flat , even hook-on high chair arms top 2 weeks 
-1	now i 'm not designer baby teethers , i 'm mom ! only nose rubber , feet hard plastic , ca n't gnaw part , feet easier make way baby 's mouth design teether the company thinks baby teethe rings around neck not possible babies n't teethe like dog gnaws bone skip one 
-1	i n't like bath i really whetted idea washing babies sink i 'm short tub deep way reasonably wash crawl tub since arms ca n't reach outside before purchase , need consider dimensions sink , shape , placement faucet i think sink small , going difficult use in addition , faucet low protrudes much , obstructive the best combination would medium-sized , oval sink , faucet n't way having said , i large , square sink high faucet rotated way cons:1 ) it n't drain base after 've washed baby soapy water , way empty dirty water lift puj tub , flip dump water , put back it 's bit dangerous 're baby wet , slippery mess 2 ) it n't fit square sink nicely it tends tilt one side spilling baby out 3 ) even older bigger , tend slide bottom leaving neck extremely flexed crumpled pros:1 ) it folds nicely saving ton space also allows take travel 
-1	we bought 10 day trip four month old daughter it fold fit carry-on suitcase advertised not really work well bathing i tried three times three different sinks never seemed fit properly it ended holding small amount water got cold uncomfortable ( not clean ) it easier sponge bath , case not need buy kind expensive tub 
-1	writing review despite total lack time this tub total waste money : bathe three-month old daily eczema i use gallon water one tea-spoon hydrogen peroxide desinfect skin tried tub purpose today it fit three quarts water ok , i thought when i gently put 12 pound baby , course water came overflow slots edges well , i gently took baby see much water left -- cup water if would like bathe wee one cup water , may tub choice anything flow right side slots a total waste money ridiculously overpiced

-1	this chair small i 'm average sized female yet chair small it not comfy quality poor the bearings squeak rocking we use wd40 multiple times will returning waste money 
-1	everything stroller irritated the instructions wordless pictures arrows pointing wrong directions times when folded `` conveniently thin design could easily put anywhere '' , thing came past knee cap there many parts n't end final product , little unsettling i refused put daughter something claims finished , yet 30 bolts , screws , pieces strewn across floor around to honest , everything much i hated product , i would n't recommend anyone sorry

-1	the power button stopped working not even two months , well works sometimes , unplug/plug 20 times press hard can yes i look get refund exchange , i 'm without warmer weeks , might well get used traditional heating

-1	i unit loved but one started leaking bottom days use i might gotten defective product reviews indicated issue i 
-1	this much smaller seat i seen toddlers there back seat , straps really `` booster '' seat however three-year-old daughter , average size , barely fits actually hates small for price , 're much better getting baby-to-toddler seat tray straps one it 'll probably work small child small chairs , average-sized dining table chairs big 
-1	at first , i n't mind made thick foam material still good job protecting 1 year old boys hitting heads faucet however , weeks , able rip foam apart trying pull cover ( it looks like toy , could n't resist playing ) i moved skip hop whale still hole shower diverter made heavy plastic 
-1	just disregard product photo , actual product looks nothing like the product photo shows thick material looks sturdy sheen ; i envisioned would made pool float type material in reality , thin , appears made packing peanuts it not grip faucet , slight contact spins around causes come if diverter spout , might help keep coming , still looks like tear easily serious disappointment this thing might worth 50 cents , even , 's not functional , cute look 
-1	product cute , low quality the foam feels cheap there seam runs along top ends top hole seam tears easily products pulled metal thing pops shower the first thing child i put bath spout , pull within minutes product torn seam the tear half way seam i not sure much longer last it 's probably worth dollar honestly , thing cost $ 3- $ 5 , i would probably keep replacing 's cute at $ 10 , 's not worth replacing total ripoff i would recommend looking different product 
-1	i originally chose spout cover cute unique however , opening package , i realized also flimsy it made light weight foam material , not plastic i decided give try anyway regret the first time son pulled ( course going curious , one year old ! ) , began rip along top seam i imagine soon unusable i disappointed looked cute the way would hold child never touches , anyone small child knows highly unlikely ! considering designed child 's protection bath time , i would say quite failure

-1	i found baby leg sticking front side prompted leave review another review mentioned front side sag i problem , try might , side not sit perfectly we standard size crib so i looked someone elses suggestion tying top crib instead sides that option not work crib i bought i like option mesh but baby grabs things pretty useless our baby pulls time the mechanics/direction knot never made make sense - not top ties - easy smooth cloth slip smooth rail tied sideways - mesh likely go down not sideways must reason case , worthless i may try get string tie up 
-1	i 'm not sure item works not it fell first time baby wore it around ankle forward facing carrier dangling legs not lot activity position not sure came i know work snap 
-1	well , organizer way cute it 's sturdy , decent amount room pack stuff , giraffe adorable however , organizer i received missing one essential element required actually hang called & # 34 ; wall organizer & # 34 ; mine missing holes hang so , i must either return exchange ( *hassle* ) hope i get one n't someone asleep assembly line , somehow make holes i afraid i make holes organizer wo n't hold damage material harumph

-1	i wanted love bag i needed big diaper bag , thing huge you 'd think huge diaper bag good thing , bag so inherently bulky even pair socks 'd carrying around giant bulky bag it n't matter 's full not i think two exterior portions add much width they snap closed ( pain ) slit back diapers/wipes n't close adds girth bag if magnet 'shut ' bag would much better i know bigger better , i 'd call bag bulky cumbersome i 'd look something else 
-1	i thought would perfect diaper bag us , many inner compartments , results much material actual means less space inside things 
-1	the spoon bit big 18 month he puts mouth food slides back spoon falls 
-1	when first added joovy double stroller thought great both kids could sit forward stroller comfortably , started use stroller noticed son 's feet go bottom storage area ( else put feet ) the problem feet push front storage area front wheels stop front wheels moving the friction front wheels storage area actually created hole front storage area it 's quality product , i ca n't recommend due functionality flaw do n't buy add , use joovy double stroller

-1	bumkins missed boat choice covers , imo they get wet real quick and i 'm also wondering could put maybe snaps cover ? ? damn , really ! ? it 's little absurd think i need many options thirsties covers better half snaps also 'pocket ' nothing hold insert 
-1	for reason feels whole thing leaks really badly i 've even considered working wax outside but i finally gave tested paper towel underneath put water actual leakage i 'm pretty sure 's kind deception get sit cold toilet seat feels wet n't either way , i feel like wear home alone anyone felt 'd think was leaking also n't chunk legged little guys like mine he 's four months already loose gon na fit another month

-1	this made cheap feeling pieces cardboard the directions emphasize child not supposed touch -- good reason i doubt strong infant could easily destroy these i agree another review except clamp , looks flimsy i think makes sense buy mobile unit without worrying infant grasping one objects mobile destroy my 6 1/2 month old grandson mobile made earlyears & # 34 ; clamp & # 34 ; made cloth velcro straps mobile objects sturdy enough grab squeeze even teeth tiny tots another excellent mobile maker bottom line : this may look nice 's cheaply made buy something infant grow , i e , get little older grab mobile play

-1	i read many great reviews i thought sure stroller would great wrong first seat when locked frame stroller , center part seat ( baby sits ) pokes never would lay flat second , back axle stroller black plastic piece right center ( i got 2013 model , not sure older models different ) i idea it nothing stroller function i constantly kicked ! i 'm not tall , 5 ' 5 5 '' tall it truely annoying ! i immediately returned stroller 
-1	unless 5'2 & # 34 ; , going constantly bending open close lid hand also , need rapidly flick lid overcome friction , 'll end tipping whole thing wall the elite unit not perfect least foot pedal works time 
-1	i got 2 year old christmas , literally coolest toy ever the batteries came dead received , replaced worked great it neat concept wonderful learning tool the adults loved playing , ! about week christmas , instruments stopped recognized then , another week later , completely useless we changed batteries avail i 'm hoping i return 
-1	should unscented bags without endocrine disrupters i 'd give 5 star its conveniently rolled bag tie bag closed dirty diaper inside smell wouldnt issue anyway 
-1	theres nothing really special ring i think plastics hard silicone flimsy my son n't even seem notice he 's put mouth spit right never looked 
-1	this product mess ! it pain fill , leaked everywhere so irritated ! would not recommend ! blah 
-1	i not impressed main reason plastic piece extends pouch it allows littlest chunks food ( tiny chunks carrots tiny bits blueberry skins size mustard seed large grains sand ) get clogged frustrates daughter ( ) they rather expensive disposable wasteful ( not environmentally friendly ) i agree reviewers caps sold separately would lower cost right average $ 30 pouch time add food pretty close store brand pouches the time takes make food fill adds opportunity cost making not really savings that leaves real advantage pouches able feed child bigger variety food knowing exactly food i tried another similar pouch cute animal designs way better even four year old loves they easier clean allow make thicker consistency purees 
-1	my child 2 years old pillow small it fits head 's room when tries turn , head goes pillow in retrospect , i bought hypoallergenic adult size pillow i n't see difference pillow high-quality adult size pillow , size obviously 
-1	this beautiful , soft sheet not hold washing i read reviews i bought sheet saw others stated sheet snagged easily wash , i made sure wash dry carefully per instructions , soft clothes without zippers buttons could possibly catch sheet after three washes , sheet already small snags fabric i really disappointed considering expensive price sheet as much i love look , i would not recommend due quality whats point paying 34 95 sheet n't hold couple weeks ? 
-1	i bought rayon bamboo blankets i love soft perfect summer i 'm not love burping cloth actual reasons it 's way soft the barf soaks right n't really clean i like burping clothes thick durable the a+a burping clothes made muslin much better cheaper the best burping clothes gerber cloth diapers now durable hope helps ! 
-1	i wanted like seat but i hate many reasons 1 pee guard i understand need one huge ? it large underpants essentially around kids ankles get legs wide enough sit around i also lift potty seat cuz freaking huge think size baseball 2 it n't clip hook anything fine kid getting anyone 's guess it moves around like crazy half time ends half potty i adjust baby seat annoying the pro easy clean ( top ) molded one piece the bottom lots grooves kinda pain thoough 
-1	i 'm looking good-quality pocket diaper replace leaky alvas n't break bank these retail diaper safari website almost $ 14 pretty sound reviews site , i figured worth shot since amazon $ 5 75 right i sorely disappointed see identical alvas , slight modification add second pocket opening front , well different snap pattern the pattern basic diaper shape/pul though , i discovered laying one top laying side side pul side , absolutely difference aside snaps the insert well , holding 3-4 ounces liquid best , compression leaks happening quickly around legs baby sitting due poor-quality microfiber letting lot pee slightest bit pressure so , i still n't found non-leaky pocket n't break bank , going back ( thankfully , amazon paying return shipping ) there 2 things make better alvas : second pocket opening makes stuffing little bit less pain , pul flap front extra protection pee creeping top diaper ( especially good boys tummy sleepers ) if light wetter moderate wetter n't mind changing every hour ( least ) , great diapers ! if want go bit longer changes , skip right past 
-1	i love design , idea , feel cup but it leaks like crazy ! ! my son 1 & 1/2 loves drinking straw found i excited get work one day next day fluid keep leaking straw even cup sitting table we found air builds pushes liquid constantly release air pressure straw 's pain keep checking cup make sure 's not leaking know messy cups not fun keep cleaning ! i would not recommend cup ! 
-1	this good idea two things i n't like reason i returned first water reservoir there way tell clean i 'm sure i clean every often vinegar not good enough i able see possible mold hard water deposit forming way tell ca n't see inside second issue much water used cooking process i used cook butternut squash i followed amount suppose use seemed like squash boiled lot water i n't like food watered yes i pour excess water pureeing nutrients lost cooking water plus , i want control much liquid goes baby food i 'm going buy small processor use steamer transfer its one extra step i feel better food 'm giving baby 
-1	to go straight points:1 ) it leaks ( i 'll upload pictures ) 2 ) after 30 minutes steaming 1 1/2 cup carrots still tough ( ! ) so i decided put water chamber steam another 20 ! then & # 34 ; puree & # 34 ; when i done , carrots ( maybe leaked water ) looking like grounded coffee anything else , i added water puree kept texture i n't want burn machine & # 34 ; pureeing & # 34 ; much ( started make weird noise 40 seconds chopping ) i got carrots ( i 'll post pictures ) i thought carrots might problem , i steamed apples happen ! 3 ) i n't even know bottle warmer works , i say , tommee tippee bottle fits comfortably , good size 4 ) it big ( specialty counter 700sq2 feet condo ) ( 10in height x 10in depth x 7in width ) power cable kind short ( 31 inches ) arghhh i going write , bruins lost stanley cup so i guess info might enough do n't buy thing , oven microwave regular blender better job ! 
-1	we one smallest potty chairs market the removable potty insert n't handles , n't even shield front little boys yet bags small fit insert i prefer grabbing old grocery bag sack full grocery bags stashed somewhere house granted , i ca n't flush , i tie toss outside trash and best , old grocery sacks free i would not buy would i recommend anyone else 
-1	pros : cheap easy assemble cons : the chair not fold size easy store this chair difficult convert booster seat putting tray big chore difficult do the back not reline least 
-1	i wanted love high chair much i loved neutral color , tray design , stability , removable pad , i absolutely not recommend product unless planning using tiny baby upgrading baby hits 1 year old the weight recommendation 20-50 pounds my baby 20 pounds he small squashed seat even tray setting put furthest away seat , tray smushed belt portion stomach there room luckily , amazon amazing vendor , let return item trouble i 've loyal amazon customer 7 years , actually first return i 've ever made that definitely says something there way i keeping 
-1	very dissatisfied monitor when works , picture , zoom , sound fine - night vision daytime - 's relief new parents like us able see sleeping baby however , system poor quality we two monitors the first one stopped working middle night the second longer holds charge , even though battery indicator says 's full when plugged , charging indicator light sometimes says charging , sometimes not the monitor often blinks randomly & # 34 ; range & # 34 ; beeps eventually coming back using antenna seems make difference reception range we never use vox option ca n't sure whether baby quiet monitor stopped working having unreliable monitor eliminates much peace mind monitor supposed provide buy another model samsung works quality issues 
-1	we motorola video monitor finally gave , bought samsung hoping would similarly easy use it not the instructions ( yeah , i read instructions x3 figure work * & # ^i thing never read one word motorola monitor ) not clear the majority time i end turning monitor night starts beeping absolutely reason the user manual says nothing it beeps three times every couple minutes starting around 2am at first i thought maybe battery low , i plugged , kept beeping the next night i left plugged night beeps happened i thought maybe picking movement son sound asleep every time happens i 've monitor 2 weeks i 2am trying trouble shoot monitor least 9 times one reasons monitor son sleeps upstairs like monitor temperature hotter rest house this thermostat not even close accurate when plugged , temperature reading seemed way , i took 2 thermostats room ( proven accurate past ) see far the reading samsung monitor said 91 degrees reading monitors 75 77 degrees i handle 4 5 degrees ( i simple math even 2am ) , 14 degrees ridiculous ! i thought maybe fluke monitor needed time `` adjust '' i waited next day test same thing , except instead 14 degrees , 10 degrees i checked randomly throughout whole day never degrees 7 degrees , 14 degrees how temperature gauge even sold `` feature '' ? ? we definitely sending back 
-1	i 'm surprised see many positive reviews monitor i 've waited write review i opportunity use product several weeks my experience baby monitor summer monitor i'ved used hours day throughout night past almost 3 years ( i actually two , i love ) however , samsung pales comparison seems considerably overpriced there several features samsung monitor i find problematic:1 ) the resolution poor while one typically using monitor make sure his/her child still bed harm 's way , seeing detail great resolution n't really necessity , i still surprised poor resolution - larger average screen , i n't see point large screen poor resolution a smaller screen better resolution seems make lot sense me 2 ) the battery life terrible the system comes power cord time needs used plugged it 's also possible use `` sleep mode '' means less battery power used , ca n't see child unless 's noise detected camera i prefer keep picture view i 'm using child sometimes gets gets bed without making sound when battery get low , battery low indicator let know , 's typcially minute two monitor dies completely must plugged in 3 ) you want make sure n't forget check camera view baby/child he/she falls asleep monitor makes obnoxious sound powered - one would likely wake anyone else sleeping room , especially baby 4 ) it 's easy touch wrong button monitor means camera monitor must `` paired '' - means walking child 's room touch button camera make happen this not good happens child n't sleep well begin finally fast asleep5 ) the cord camera short , reduces options place camera relation outlet mounting camera corner room not option 6 ) the menu/navigation seems primitive - feels like first computer ( terms functinality , irrelevant , given price point , i expected something bit advanced the real positive features i see capacity integrate multiple cameras `` talk '' feature talk child overall , i disappointed baby monitor 
-1	we looking replace 4 yr old summer monitor become bit crackly we ordered lorex both going back due horrible audio quality both speaker back monitor , ridiculously flimsy kickstands units useless the sound turned way hope hearing baby become upset screaming , volume high , annoying hissing noise instead with old summer monitor , easily hear child 's every breath , choose is n't point monitor ? 
-1	i product month , used maybe 20 nights , quit working ! and yes , i changed batteries , nothing i give 2 stars lights great baby work the sound quality not great , used light projection i 'm rather bummed quit working 
-1	i bought set ikea 's lot cheaper get 6 bowls $ 2 50 , 6 cups $ 2 50 , 18 utensils $ 2 50 so get entire set shown $ 7 50 ikea if n't ikea nearby $ 15 n't bad , i almost bought something amazon i read review someone buying actual store i saved ton money since , , i always try pass tip the product awesome , buy away ca n't get ikea 
-1	this product flimsy 2 piece extension husband joking would n't keep gerbil really regretting purchase get something else i n't even want put child only reason gets 2 stars fairly easy put together panels shake , gate drags ground would not recommend ! 
-1	we using play yard keep toddler stairs it worked fairly well became extremely mobile grown less less effective months 've the panels light easily lifted little one ( daughter small 15 month-old ) bungee cord panels stair railings either side n't move gate way even bungee cords , figured move panels enough squeeze get stairs my husband i always strongly disliked gate play yard hate months use the gate requires lift order open entire panel light instead releasing , entire gate panel simply lifts ground n't open we found step corner panel hold lifting gate it 's ridiculous constant source frustration i n't know anything better certainly would n't purchase 
-1	i ordered feeding set 20 month old daughter she obsessed playing mommy trying feed babydoll stuffed animals sippy cups looked like fun alternative she 's happy product , i really disappointed it not described there pacifier bib , juice comes regular small bottle- not sippy cup also , bottom milk bottle slightly rounded , not sit upright frustrates daughter falls sets the milk bottle makes drinking , burping crying sounds press end , not product description i would preferred 4-piece set described , probably would ordered one n't make sounds i realized i would actually receiving 
-1	i literally watch son 's saliva roll bib i not know material slightly waterproof this bib useless ! i thought material new improvement several washes 
-1	i bought bibs i liked 100 % cotton & seemed highly reviewed the downside bibs neck small i feel like already very tight 2 month old & not particularly big baby i feel bit uncomfortable even putting small neck size these bibs cute terms material sewing seem well made 's shame price pay n't going work baby long 
-1	i ordered sheet knowing aden aden + anais lower end line pretty much i expected , i still n't like enough keep it thin , i n't think would hold lot wear tear for price i felt carter 's brand better choice i looking personally , i think worth paying aden + anais line products get higher quality item 
-1	i not big fan crib sheet it made thin material you see writing mattress straight it also snags easily nails i would not purchase product 
-1	thought would bigger they really small would not stay furniture i quite disappointed 
-1	we received gift , i would never picked stroller , tried anyway after 6 months fabric tore metal rod front , exposing rod this happened simply baby 's knee pushing fabric there reason stroller cheap -- disposable , like disposable diaper we 're changing something like uppababy g-lite 
-1	i couple issues potty training potty it appears rather popular , reviews 4/5 star range , personally i 'm not impressed others seem first , deodorizing scent not prominent might well not even second , n't potty really instills sense urgency potty training it n't get child excited use it plain white potty arm hammer logo top the colors murky orange green stripe it n't much look , despite may want believe , children react way something looks third , small the seat n't comfortable ( daughter even complained hurting butt ) we another potty cushioned seat , prefers far yes , gender natural ( seems something reviews responded ) easy clean , many potties easy clean this , , n't worth it cheap feeling looking n't inspire child want try 
-1	we weeks , totally useless the screws holding battery door problem one stripped got , door broke i trying get open put batteries no problem , screw n't stripped i got one held weeks the door completely broke last night son turning , though , batteries wo n't stay make thing operational since son likes much , i probably try rig tape i would n't recommend actually buying , though 
-1	it thick tilted mattress significantly not useable us maybe heavier mattress would work well 
-1	i thought i broke finger turning thing i put weight one finger thing vibrates hard makes much noise ! i really excited getting , one buys i regret 
-1	our baby hated vicious passion for starters difficult turn understanding 3 second hold depressed button difficult get finger press once , first setting seemed fine discovered vibrates way fast baby 's comfort detail , item vibration increased mattress pressure caused baby stay wide awake scream though earthquake happening 's song lyrics fit soooo well started crying sounded like earthquake this item definitely baby specific not discourage cry thing , remove back normal time simply may not like due 's fast vibration i test things like baby i absolutely hate soo much smaller , may feel sure i placed pillow beneath head thing shook brain skull , chattered teeth uncomfortable i understand may coming anger tried 
-1	i super excited get ! my lo never sleeps crib , falls fast sleep pack play using vibrating feature out box little bulky i not sure well would fit mattress crib i put batteries comes ( plus ) , i pressed power button would not come i pressed , finally came victory ! well short lived , i turned test i could not turn the cover big bulky find & # 34 ; sweet spot & # 34 ; turn i tell i pushing button , nothing happening the vibrating mechanism fairly small , bit sure used bulky covering perhaps babies like princess pea 
-1	my newborn loved vibrations created the disappointing factor battery operated perhaps manufacturers make items battery operated safety reasons , many items battery operated , making cost types items much higher we fisher price pappasan , thing takes 4 c batteries , eats like nothing have seen price 8 pack c cell batteries ? in past 4 months 've spent around $ 30 batteries vibration pad , $ 100 batteries pappasan make sure buy item like n't mind extra expense batteries oh , device eats batteries 
-1	i change batteries daily ( used , maybe twice night ) it quit working two weeks it 's sitting packaging , i keep forgetting return 
-1	did not lull baby sleep , even though sleeps well car in fact , i think makes seasick threw wish i 'd kept box receipt , i 'd return 
-1	i found useless product it made ton noise sound made little unnerving it anything soothing baby trying sleep the pace vibration way furied 
-1	absolute waste money ! ! ! i regret buying piece ! my baby never liked i hated sound ! we lost sleep 
-1	need plug version ok get along ok good idea 
-1	i 15 month old daughter started talking sleep husband i decided needed buy video monitor make sure awake went room accidently woken going room check heard start stirring i started researching video monitors found levana brand 4+ start reviews amazon ( note : i amazon prime member frequent reader reviews i decided buy item ) i liked price video monitor compared prices ones made motorola summer infant it seemed reasonable online reviews item good the reviews specifically said day time color picture clear bright night vision worked well i not find either true experience we set new monitor friday night not able test color picture first day use the night vision worked , not great picture ( certain items bright others blurry ) on saturday late morning put daughter nap , tested color picture the colors monitor completely room extremely well lit color picture even work when went bed saturday night , night vision still working , sunday morning , woke black blurry screen it appears night vision leds gone i called customer service levana sunday morning , per instructions manual monitor , find could not talk anyone business hours monday-friday the customer service line walks trouble shooting measures try get monitor start working ( i e turn monitor , check light room , etc ) i found completely unacceptable this product sells items baby safety how many working parents able call defective baby monitor office ? my husband i returned monitor amazon ended buying much , expensive nicer monitor manufacturer motorola another retailer if i could give monitor levana zero stars , i would i disappointed quality product well lack service provided levana 
-1	this second levana video baby monitor i 've owned the , babyview20 , pretty decent this one opposite the best thing i say handles interference well nice receiver unit we use sound machine provide white noise kids this monitor sound threshold silent sound unfortunately , white noise sets threshold 's always pumping white noise , would n't bad lowest volume setting monitor n't darn loud the thing n't resample baseline ambient sound , white noise always ticks mechanism it 's super annoying , strange since babyview20 , older product levana , *does* resample baseline next horrendous base station permanently fixed camera it not omni-directional when turn camera base , angle moves continuous wave that 's adjust angle view ya the peaks valleys wave not large enough provide necessary versatility the base oddly slot screw mount wall however , would mount camera directly child 's bed , might ok power cable n't short on top , camera easily twists base , throws angle i found readjusting camera every night , frustrating process altogether the receiver unit actually one advanced feature you pair multiple cameras ( 4 i think ) cycle the main selling point camera , invisible infra-red leds , actually true i guess kids get scared red ring cameras ? i n't know , one n't ring night however , camera strangely sent foggy night time image day use i tried cleaning front lens cleaner , helped little bit , still foggy i really not recommend product 
-1	i purchased box turtle it 's cute , cheaply made not worth price the box not open smoothly either one sides would always get stuck there 's better quality boxes i would not recommend 
-1	nice material , n't absorb sons pee originally bought use reusable , earth friendly wipes , honest got lazy running back forth sink got old using pee shield baby boy ( anyone boy knows , unsafe leave exposed changing ) n't absorb instead pee goes right onto changing pad , exactly 'm trying avoid anyway , 20 use wipe drool oh well ! 
-1	i looking reusable squeeze pouch saw two pack walmart decided buy waste money wish i checked reviews first was hoping use go yogurt pureed food toddler unfortunately not travel friendly , requires supervision you ca n't toss pouch bag unless want big ol ' mess inside bag the lid ( part open fill pouch , not cap spout ) n't secure food reaches hard green plastic part lid suppose close , 's hard get last bit food so not make sure toddler n't pop lid open squeezing food , food trapped inside area inch high inch wide a cubic inch food trapped how toddler expected get food i ca n't even help squeeze i 've always open scoop rest yogurt spoon defeats purpose squeeze pouch also , i tried filling pouches yogurt 6oz container n't fit even though claims fit 6oz food it seems like 4 5 oz food fits pouch i 'm not search better product pros : -- reusable -- fairly easy clean -- fairly easy fill without funnel cons : -- lids not secure pops so not travel safe ( ca n't toss bag ) -- once food reaches hard green plastic part spout connected , 's difficult get last bit food out -- does not seem hold much claims 
-1	these work ok , thr top put food not stay closed well though the disposable ones work better

-1	i not fan bottle warmer i bought cute , would fit wide-neck bottle , bottle warmers price range rated truly outstanding once i started putting use warm breast milk bottles , i learned not us first , i guess case many warmers , measure seems like arbitrary amount fluid specific amount milk heating using little beaker stored warmer the difference various measured amounts little , imagine difficult get exact measurement wit ha screaming baby arms waiting bottle ! not good however , filled correctly seemed warm milk well first days after days , started take twice long warm bottles ! it overheated precious breast milk point scalding ! ! not i not feed baby , actually decreases nutritional value milk , sad also dangerous come trust warmer - though always check temperature feeding baby i think product could definitely improved upon luckily amazon gave full refund i exchanged dr brown 's bottle warmer , happy far 
-1	the shape pads awkward the pad ( inside portion ) slightly larger outer , pad actually curves away instead cupping if darts sewn circle could conform natural shape woman even sports bra see raised edges pad on top shape , lining sticks skin borders pain peeling away skin the idea pad great , execution not much 
-1	the caitlin pattern pretty ! but i hate hugs system , rubber looks uncomfortable , baby sitting , car seat cover flaps come see styrofoam underneath , i not latch storage straps hang looking sloppy i rear facing , straps may hide better front facing , i suppose also i find difficult loosen straps and seat not well padded ( compared car seat - chicco nextfit ) i returning car seat i sad , beautiful pattern !

-1	seems padded safe , however compared car seat dino radian rxt , least daughter , much uncomfortable difficult snap the slots straps uncomfortable child gets certain heights also straps often get twisted making difficult strap child , especially getting fussy due discomfort is also quite wide , much dino radian rxt ( though one not much padding , heck lot heavier , likely due metal framing ) 
-1	if i could return i would box got wet since transitioning seat hate going anywhere son not tolerate carseat on top crying baby cries nonstop , it hard tighten loosen straps i 'm not wimp getting movement pull strap tighten baby 's shoulder traps almost impossible i pretty much travel husband i n't feel confident able seat difficult loosening straps bad apparently case seats feature clicks know tight enough i worry getting quickly emergency with seat would n't problem as stands , owning around month i still difficulty using it not gotten easier the fact matter went content 7 month old happy infant carseat ( chicco kefit 30 ) actually enjoyed car rides despite small cutting shoulders highest setting , 7 month old cries entire time seat unless someone sits back distracts food i never get sit front travel i wo n't go place baby difficulty use crying we took shoulder pads helped n't crying like pain constantly reclined far goes also improved far goes traveling nightmare seat we even tried swapping back seat fine traveling , big not safe i saving buy different seat i feel i wasted money i would not recommend it to anyone even sale i got $ 190 lightening deal i suspect deal issues 
-1	my 3 year old absolutely interest he likes wooden blocks he likes lego he likes fisher price little people he n't like this the manufacturing quality seems good , although excess glue inside storage box the colors muted earth tones pleasant the inside storage box also painted used `` play set , '' area small the items proportion , especially monstrous mushrooms , way not stand upright matter do this seems like type toy would appeal parents , not children i recommend something fun play 
-1	i really wanted love stroller after glowing reviews thorough research , i decided give inglesina swift try unfortunately , i disappointed i return it here positives : reclining feature excellent ( major plus umbrella strollers , kids sleep , parents enjoy hour two sightseeing running errands ) it lays almost flat easy slide ( opposed umbrella strollers annoying reclining cords ) smooth ride feels light easy navigategreat/big sun shadecon - which unfortunately major one true deal breaker : very uncomfortable the back seat hard i could not believe if buy stroller need cushion , combined price stroller , end costing equal upscale strollers like uppababy g-luxe there one con , major one i could not get it like buying pretty coach looks hating sit what purpose ? inglesina , please add padding back !

-1	when i started feeding son solids , i purchased pack pouch pops use 20 squooshi pouches these ones available time , course i got the pouch pops lengthen & soften hard spout pouches , 's pretty much opinion i still squeeze pouches son would constantly squeeze hard fast , & end wearing food ! then came sip'n tops it 's like read mind ! i seriously love caps they one way valve , baby get food sucking they squeeze & squeeze & not single drop spill ! i longer hold pouch son , hold & feed matter minutes ! i also love attached loop & cover storage so baby n't finish contents pouch , pop cap 's cover let finish little bit later i could n't pouch pops , n't covers storage they also n't much needed ( & appreciated ! ) one way valve ! the sip'n caps expensive per 2 pack , worth every penny opinion i 'd seriously pay double mess free like i lately ! i bought 10 , still 6 unopened rotating original 4 i first purchased overall , sip'n caps win ! they soften hard spouts , covers storage/travel , amazing mess free valve ! if want something soften spouts , pouch pops would work ! 
-1	the ziploc seal rips away sides within couple uses ! ! this must not problem batches product ( lots people love ! ) i research thought product would best i hand washed first one broke less 1 week , i opened 3 carefully possible ( pouches rip way ) we wanted pouches work , could make purees save money dozens pouches go month like others problem ( read 1 star reviews ) company sent us 4 new pouches , 3 4 original pouches broke , i wanted refund ( agreed after i return 4 replacement pouches ) this product certainly wo n't hold time ( needs make $ 20 cost worth ! ) plus , 's made china ! come !

-1	this straw cup seems like great idea a lid twists closed makes cup leak-proof a huge straw thirsty child drink quickly wants and interchangeable lids oxo cups except cup leaks lid twisted closed before even hand child , put water , screw cap , twist lid closed , watch cup drip water unless hold perfectly vertical ( if wanted cup needed held perfectly vertical , 'd use cup a regular cup the kind without lid ) and lid different threads oxo sippy cup , lids not interchangeable advertised when contacted oxo , took week say got message would get back us someday , 've reply since 
-1	pissed son weeks hubby putting together two bars messed need contact graco get two new ones set paid 100 comes broken thank ! 
-1	the idea design swing great the function not our baby 13 lbs swing not work well even highest speed if kicked moved , swing stopped give push restart swinging motion the motor loud also we returned too bad liked colors , size ability plug wall outlet instead using batteries 
-1	i got gift worked well baby 's first 4 weeks , hit certain weight ( maybe 10 lbs ) thing stopped swinging even highest level now push manually , stupid the bar middle also falls wo n't stay place my son really likes watching things swing flowers first objects focused , bar topples easily it 's soft n't hurt anything , poorly designed i would n't waste money glider !

-1	i received swing gift cutest little swing , reason not swing son swing if i take swings perfectly becomes lazy starts slow the battery life isnt good either seems drain batteries give horrible swings i would not recommend swing one unless manual swing inside house 
-1	i got lo little year really n't know it 's nice cup though i n't sure i could teach drink bummer i try 's 18 months 
-1	the thing good cups weighted straw = 1 star lost 1 star leaks 12m old carries around turns upside ( showering tonight left 2 seconds ) lost 3 stars leaks even lid closed ! we brought daycare spilled everywhere the lids screwed tight tops closed no idea popular & cost much i 'm going see returning probably one worst investments 've made my son drink fine ( drink straw sippy fine ) but nothing else worth purchase 
-1	bought 6 glad i n't open washed 2 pouches , filled applesauce lid popped made huge mess shortly giving 2 year old ! not happy wasted 8 $ 2 walmart least i return 4 
-1	it amazes product made shelves ! the top literally & # 34 ; rests & # 34 ; place the design could easily rectified top actually & # 34 ; snapped & # 34 ; i wanted love easy fill clean ( i used bottle brush ) essentially useless one year old certainly n't going sit hold top place eating booginhead : redesign top would good product ! 
-1	i actually like materials product fact cap attached however , prduct design , waste least ounce ( 4 total hold ) left pouch the fill opening top pouch made solid material not allow food sqeezed even 3-year-old ca n't suck hard enough get food it ends wasting fourth put 
-1	so i bought jogging stroller based fantastic reviews i britax stroller organizer regular stroller ( yes , i two strollers i n't need two strollers first kid i 'm learning ! ) i really prefer whenever pack thing car , everything organizer spills i realize i could empty time , i forget and britax organizer ( center velcro flap keeps items in organizer ) , i 'm forgiven 
-1	huge disappointment sags , ca n't hold bottles bottles flip forget even trying putting adult drinks 
-1	as soother , dependent one 's idea soothing i n't think right product get baby fall asleep but calm baby ? in experience , yes my daughter loves staring ( i , honest ) the animals adorable , i like like gives well variety rainforest sounds swans aesthetics-wise , 's downright attractive but getting child sleep ? too distracting this goes `` toy '' category update : well , worked three days mind , i used fresh batteries , even changed new batteries stopped working nada hopefully mine simply faulty individual among many , mine stopped working apparent reason 
-1	i gave one star would not attach crib the instructions also state hang seven inches crib mattress 
-1	this thing goes batteries faster newborn went pack diapers it worked sometimes soother , time , wasnt worth money the straps hang crib idiotic , i say crib thick rails straps didnt fit spacing sizing crib luckily i able cobb together rusty nails sharp metal strapping fix screw driver handle , use screw driver wedge straps together 
-1	i leather headrests car product slipped place it never stayed put driving i also hated installation design directions you loop around one way ( over/under ) slippery leather there n't way stabilize mirror i returned trying one britax back seat mirror way features costs amazon 
-1	we struggled thing nearly month giving it absolutely not positioned car way allow either driver passenger see baby it also distressing tendency fall 
-1	the brica baby in-sight auto mirror n't work first , easy way hook middle backseat n't head rest strap i jury rig product pain second , angle adjustment means unless baby sitting much higher average , ' easily angle mirror see need see otherwise mirror good reflection quality plastic mirror product light n't worry detaching causing injury 
-1	i hate give low rating , unable use return my son basic twin bed sits twin bed box spring twin bed frame rooms go i say say 's basic , twin bed my son 3 , transitioned converted crib `` big-boy bed '' thought needed railing this one seemed fit bill except not appear way get properly fit twin bed the options bed rail clasps straps either squeezed bed way tight would barely stay big fit twin size i n't know got defective one , frustrating especially since bedrail took 20-30 minutes put together came lots different pieces we ultimately take apart resend back i know reviewers mentioned not fit children 's beds may little different , i expected basic thing advertised - fit twin size bed 
-1	we using couple weeks transitioned daughter & # 34 ; big girl bed & # 34 ; strap goes mattress already broke really unfortunate product fail quickly , length good idea great , 's not well made 
-1	not really soft absorbent multiple feeding spit the colors cut job briefly also i got i wash right away ( would 've anyway ) cause looked like 'd dropped trampled packaging 
-1	too small helpful us n't absorbent -- baby n't spit lot , -- needed lot tiny piece flannel ( when spit , spit lot ) i think i 'd recommend buying extra cloth diapers dish towels instead the patterns cloth cute , though 
-1	as february 12 , 2014 , graco recall buckle car seats , not model , reason graco 's spokesperson quoted saying model call graco still replace buckle ever since got car seat found buckle extremely difficult unbuckle , not surprise find recall happened the government criticized graco not expanding recall model i called recall number get new buckle recording said getting many calls i call back later overall system many flaws , heavy , not ride nearly smoothly expected , graco recalls buckle ignores model dismay government safety regulators 
-1	this review based 2 months use travel system also provides perspective ofbritax b-ready stroller , blackusers jogger : - heavy bulky takes full trunk space nisan altima leaves space groceries small suitcase etc - good maneuvering capabilities - large wheels , ideal jogging sidewalks uneven surfaces - one click , one hand fold works ca n't lift one hand put back car due awkward shape - once folded , supposed stand support rod lower center portion now rod bad design never stays place fold back time the metal grip rod snap firmly axle n't often standing rod moves back forth , hence making impossible stand it especially annoying considering fact graco using feature selling point - the storage basket bottom useful big - there cupholder smartphone cradle well , mind iphone 5 new bigger androd phones not fit there - one particular negative point padding along frame cloth wrapped around also , frame rod close place child 's head usually we incident say bad design hurt baby - you always remember put brakes both back wheels if ever forget one , jogger may pivot around one brakes rotate come graco , could made one convenient one brake paddle common feature strollers car seat : - feels cheap plasticky - base installation easy not easy level up - feels light not sturdy able protect precious load carries - for reason , son 's head always drops front side sleeping there head support the foam provided name head support joke and mind baby not small lightweight either he good 90+ percentile range still leans side - belt/harness ok expected overall , travel system not good value price it expensive offers lot less similar price range products like britax b-agile b-safe etc in fact britax free ride event , b-ready chaperone combination give lot better value safety price ( it honest suggestion based terrible accident recently britax not paying writing )

-1	pouches make easy get food needs go without making mess there spoons grab , morsels drop floor , babies feed relatively easy little assistance i thought pouches would great baby , even wash , still smell like last thing that 's kind gross think plus plastic feels pretty cheap , makes wonder safe long run at twenty bucks four pouches , n't cheap either i recommend putting money better use elsewhere 
-1	it 's simple - use bottles n't wide mouth ( aka bottles best breast-feeding babies ) not brush i unfortunately found hard way , impossible get bottle i tried using brush dishes , feel like i n't completely wasted money , microfiber pads get disgusting look bacteria-filled within first uses i put dishwasher clean , still n't look clean enough future uses , i tossed i 'm back munchkin brand bottle brush love 
-1	saw product thought could life saver came used , total disappointment small not close properly expands use company make durable , basket also put bottles well nipples parts nuk nipples bottom part basket useless hated munchkin less 
-1	we use nuk 's bottles house until recently , though , used themunchkin deluxe dishwasher basketto run bottle caps , collars , nipples dishwasher they fit pretty badly , saw nuk version , bought it that mistake this thing made soft , flimsy plastic the expanding rack sections slip tracks easily slide the whole thing bends twists instead stability whatsoever the top section nipples n't hinged base , rather loose piece plastic , slight gymnastics load close without everything falling alignment and strangest , nuk bottle components n't fit well the slots lid close together relatively large nipple bases you fit one cap two collars expanding sections , even sections extended far go , 's space 2 5 caps so , fully loading , have:12 nipples , kinda overlapping crammed together ( 6 want elbow room ) 4 caps8 collarsthat math n't work about good part bottom section short enough caps ca n't flip end dishwasher cycle full gritty dirty water i 've switched back munchkin dishwasher basket , least load without swearing 
-1	my biggest gripe open sides i constantly pacifier nipples coming clean would get dirty probably ok put something block holes far practicality useless traveling 
-1	i n't know i excited get i guess i hate dish rack gets cluttered tons bottles everyday i wash bottles food containers end day , pretty useless it barely fit 3 nipples 2 seals also short fat bottles like tommee tippee looks weird , like meant thinner bottles i also wish would plug the fan also noisy it sounds like 's going break while yes , may dry bottles faster , like wash 3 time , way many things i n't like it 's packed away using day 
-1	this rack turned much , much less useful i thought would a reasons it:1 ) c-size batteries ( really ? i thought watches ) not included adapter , although base rack allows bigger batteries2 ) short rods hold bottles ; barely fit 6 oz bottles3 ) way hold accessories 8 bottlesi say , look something better 
-1	cheapest made rack history racks it difficult even connect reason customer assemble tiny rack 6 pieces arrives ( ? ! ) parts n't fit quite well a disappointing product brand

-1	with baby # 2 way , market double stroller we loved bugaboo frog ( hand-me-down ) naturally thought donkey would way go , given past success brand reputation plus looks much nicer side-by-side doubles i n't want spend $ 1,700 ( base plus duo kit plus various accessories ) something i n't test driven , went store brought older child us much intense surprise , already tall enough could not comfortably extend canopy ( head level canopy meets top seat ) i normally n't review items i not , i not seen mentioned previously i thought would important point out my son 80th percentile height long torso , 's two half , one would hope stroller would last least age 4 -- 's rated 38 lbs , seemed reasonable think 27lb kid would fit ! if i expecting newborn twins , i 'd probably go 's pretty conveniently sized options fantastic plus i love bugaboos handle think incredible versatile but buy less attractive double stroller width 1/3 price without cramping older child deal ridiculousness folding bugaboo ( 'd really think 'd fixed ) 
-1	returned large ridiculously sized the medium really n't much better i not sure point product by time big enough use , old enough keep covers oh well , quality great , sizing way

-1	i simple requirements baby monitors : good visual child , infrared night vision , audio everything else extra that said , i think i 'm fairly qualified rating monitor since i 've cycled four , still , favorite one first bought n't sold anymore ( lorex wl2002w ) the lorex n't zoom pan , one extra feature i enjoy ( not necessary ) , i problems one camera not working properly , lorex 's warranty fixed it sadly , motorola mbp26 n't cut it 's nice sleek design i seriously wanted work us the video ad amazon made look like perfect fit clear resolution but upon using monitor visual quality appalling ! the screen `` pixulated , '' pixels get wavy affect 's irritating look our lorex camera clear in fact , use monitors sons room one pointed son 's bunk bed , ( motorola ) son 's crib -- combined give us full visual room there n't zoom motorola , pan around room gives good coverage both cameras sit six feet ( maybe ) sons crib , ten feet sons bunk bed the quality noticeably different i barely recognize son crib -- 's blob when using motorola i look movement know 's awake not , sometimes i ca n't tell with lorex i see details , even older sons eyes open ( 10 feet away ) the night vision lorex great , , i even see eyes shinning open night the motorola good luck , ca n't make details i tried positioning monitor closer got little better results , not much would expect i ca n't put monitor close sons crib really n't good place i screw wall , i wires hang place i 'm not comfortable i n't think 's unreasonable request expect camera work six foot distance another thing i tried cut interference room i thought maybe lorex camera causing interference , i unplugged same issue i ca n't recommend product anyone it 's nicely designed , sleek , pans well , audio awesome , quality extremely poor i figured four years since bought first monitor improved greatly , i n't found one has i debated giving one two stars i went two still kind see using monitor , 's not clear all features work great 
-1	i stoked motorola i could move camera without constantly walk daughters room said , 2 things highlight monitor i lorex gave 5 stars amazon that monitor beats hands flying colors why ? * the picture quality motorola sub par * the night vision total junk * the monitor half size lorex* this costs lorex n't following features1 ) no temperature display2 ) does n't play lullabies3 ) ca n't connect via skype3 ) no time date displayand well list could go do n't waste money i idea would get high reviews unless 've never checked monitors i would like add night vision crappy i came write review switch baby monitors 1am 
-1	we foscam first maybe spoiled resolution camera 's `` night vision '' joke i see baby in crib , 's blurry flickery 
-1	i really wanted love pouches , hard use keep clean we gave 
-1	we bought 20 month old baby likes using , toothbrush really made cheap quality materials vibration switch n't always work this product poorly made not ideal infants falls apart hazardous at time writing first review , make sure read review onsummer infant gentle vibrations massager and toothbrushwhich essentially thing you see lots reviews mentioning pretty much defects 
-1	i n't buy mine amazon website using free coupons i pay shipping quite expensive ( $ 11 ) i wanted return item i informed i not i used coupon anyway , reason i wanted return nursing cover material really cheap the material stiff , thin , poorly made it not provide good coverage nursing well it not worth shipping cost i would not recommend product 
-1	my son hates covered breast-feeding waste money us respect , even liked , i would n't i 'm large-chested would make seeing i 'm practically impossible , even stiff top designed give idea 's happening plus , fabric thin , stiff , cheap feeling , even washing reviewers suggested doing i 've found people n't care 're breastfeeding i n't usually even bother cover , i , i use lightweight swaddling blanket cover majority breast 's exposed , rather covering baby 's face know works buy cover like 
-1	my baby n't show much interest spoons reason harder time holding regular spoons 
-1	i returned cups 10mo son could not extract milk it appears need bite straw suck get anything not good product design i ordered i like look functionality removable handles however , not usable 
-1	i searching items net purchase allow son not throw plate floor i purchased different kinds products/brands , nothing worked point the suction cups bottom all items/brands i bought , n't work there not enough suction behind i would apply pressure , wetness , name , nothing worked after 3 minutes , product would unstick plate/bowls/cups tossed this product waste money time spent returning trust ! 
-1	for solid foods container okay i would avoid item want something leak proof the lids difficult snap , even lot effort make sure lids sealed way around , liquid still escaped sides i would use foods like mac/cheese , cheerios , items similar consistency cleans really easily dishwasher , though 
-1	i expected excellent quality fisher price meal go container sorely disappointed the idea two compartment container travel spoon great design flaw positives first , used dry snacks i tested could hold liquid without leaking , failed miserably ! i put little bit water compartments , shut , i tipped side , water leaked sides part reason leaked n't snap completely shut - push 5 places get close , even shut one compartment , comes unsnapped cover pops open lastly , plastic feels cheap the reason i n't give one star carry dry snacks traveling overall , not worth $ 1 00 , let alone $ 8 00 price tag 
-1	my baby pretty fine i got bottles recommended doctor the day i use first day started colics it might not related i feel back dr browns 
-1	i dind't like shape our lo dind't either i tried many sippy cups favorites playtex straws , using munchkin replaceable straws order hit bottom cup ( shave end knife ) the hard nozzle gets worn away biting rubber ones gerber graduates great we used mil since spill/drip proof used playtex straw ones water since leak little they not hard put together like reviewers say 
-1	what hype pail ? it 's awful it 's hard dispose dirty diaper pail there foot pedal help lift top , press diaper pail really hard dispose anyone changed messy diaper knows difficult ( gross ) i recommend diaper dekor plus i one first , even though hinge top broke , 's still better design i 'm returning ordering another diaper dekor plus 
-1	at first , i really excited diaper genie but , research , i found i none pleased high cost refill bags i ended giving away i ca n't justify paying much bag 
-1	i bought high chair third last child , i n't want spend fortune i previously used boon flair two older children over years , seat became bit wobbly , i thought time new one i big kids ( 90th percentile height weight ) i need something strong my house overrun toys i really n't want high chair screams baby dining room here 's i like poppy high chair:1 looks : it looks great it 's minimalist the red nice cranberry red without loud 2 large tray : it nice large tray goes way around n't seem leave nooks cranes food get trapped 3 cleaning : the material seat comes easily seems like would easy clean again , seat really try make one piece possible really n't leave nooks cranies 4 length use : i really liked could potentially used toddler/child chair later here 's i n't like i think fatal flaws poppy chair:1 durability : i found whole seat little wobbly it 's held 4 little thin metal sticks it less support folding chairs at least kids , i n't think hold several years even get child/toddler seat setting 2 difficult tray : while i liked large tray , i not like difficult get tray i actually read manual make sure i trying right thing pressing plastic notch/bottom i trying right way , really tricky this without child i imagine difficult would day day wriggly child and child wriggly ( see next post ) 3 the decorative harness/straps : i call decorative not functional it shoulder straps , come bottom , not top chair these shoulder straps decoration appease parents think child 5 point harness , not so fighting remove tray seat also managing wriggly non-harnessed child for , super hard tray removal combined non-harnessing wobbly pair metal sticks fatal combination high chair could not overcome nice look design seat it 's going back today i 've contacted boon getting new bolts attempt re-secure boon flair chair bought new straps seat padding one try make last couple years it really nice try phil teds , i ca n't understand designers thought horrible tray removal harness maybe future year models improve , , i 'd say skip high chair 
-1	the reviews not good thiswe took chance the light stays day side n't make son happy i ca n't figure set alarm 
-1	this sleeper worked great i first set the baby stays sometime not long the problem i sleeper i n't get close in video looked easy 's not no matter many time i push bottoms side wont close it 's really annoying i think one bottoms n't working n't snap i press you really make sure parts products working sell someone i 'm fed annoyed i break sleeper 
-1	pros : lots featuresdaytime picture clearcamera run rechargeable batteries ( lasts 4-5 hours ) camera mounted clipping something , using suction cupsmonitor sizescreen displays : camera 're , signal strength , battery life , date , time , & temperaturerangecons : crappy feature qualitynight time picture qualityfpsnot true pan/tilteven though baby monitor lot pros , n't like enough keep since video monitor , quality outweighs quantity while i liked monitor daytime use , night vision horrible super blurry ! also , fps really horrible true ; lot features , n't matter quality n't good the temperature n't accurate , displayed 5 degrees higher actually the sound quality n't good lullabies play pointless the pan/tilt feature deceiving you zoom first , pan/tilt area zoomed the quality zoomed also really bad 
-1	since i already made commitment make homemade baby food little one , i figured stop i began searching i thought would best reusable baby food pouch , came across go fresh baby i really liked zipper side instead bottom feeding tube top instead side i excited placed order fairly quickly i really appreciated product came easy follow , step step instructions i followed instructions i could wash pouches use upcoming week the zipper extremely hard open in fact , one pouches zipper separated pouch now opening pouch zipper remains sealed this disappointing i n't product long i 'm hoping i 'll able get sorted 
-1	it extremely hard open pouch i suppose great baby holding , nearly impossible use especially little dirty food 
-1	i looking food pouch n't leak found one glad opening difficult open that 's good right ? wrong after tear open opening spooning food purees small opening , got tiresome in addition , sipping half contents pouch , rest sipped well , food puree pushed top portion pouch this not case pouches i 've used , plum organics etc baby food pouches the plus i see food pouch design cap large , much like food pouches sold stores 
-1	the knob constantly coming apart scrubber next time i would purchase regular brush it 's inconvenient clean dr brown bottles begin - brush makes process way annoying ! 
-1	my husband i found teddy bear strap covers much better they fuller softer babies face these flat not soft nothing support son 's head carrier 
-1	i gave diapers 2 cute inexpensive that 's best i say i 've using 3 month old couple weeks every time expect leakage they come 2 inserts really bulky even 2 i expect wetness seeping i n't think cover material waterproof 'd expect typical pocket diapers the inserts thin i 've tried put charlie banana inserts see would help still leaks cover if i 'd known 'd poor keeping clothing dry i 'd gone extra $ 50 00 got another 6 pack charlie 's 
-1	i tried install usa abroad impossible i would not recommend buying unless sure work outlets 
-1	waited color 2 months , finally came the peacock color not pictured color plain blue darker hue quite far image shown advertisement , sad , i thought would pretty returning kiwi here 's hoping kiwi color pictured ! 
-1	after maybe hour leak sons clothes the i got not leak put 2 liners made diaper bulky difficult put pants cheap not worth it btw : i bought bumgenius diapers while little expensive , n't leak 
-1	this n't work outlets one screw top one bottom -- works outlets use one single screw , middle two plugs go the description really stated , i ordered one every outlet house twins access , i ca n't use i also ca n't return i ordered needed , n't think check something like , months twins started crawl needed , return window passed also , cord shortener joke i one single outlet house used one screw middle , , cord shortener shortened standard lamp cord inches there n't room cord , would certainly never room two cords 
-1	this really big waste money $ 9 piece rough wood string ? it n't look like bird angles , wavy shape i recommend going another teether 
-1	cheaply made mats , i ordered set suv compact car one ripped right away , n't fit like picture , always curling edges i probably throw away buy cloth kick mats 
-1	the first negative potty cheaply made china using low grade plastic ours came cracks already plastic two halves join not enough ruin potty , enough suggest wo n't last long n't made quality mind by far worst thing , however , extremely poor design choice join two halves ( colored top white bottom piece ) seam open upwards ( look closely piectures 'll see i mean ) think : 've got potty made kids learning use one , design liquid spills outside get trapped tiny seam ca n't separate ? brilliant the two halves n't designed come apart clean good luck getting urine completely unless kid sort urinary genius never miss you 'll need spray bathtub get everything joint two plastic parts we 've two pottys , neither poorly designed problem i recommend baby bjorn , potty used first-born , pretty much company choose probably sell better one the bjorn , example , made one base piece , parts difficult clean crevices i 'd think would try hard screw engineering piece plastic pee , yet prince lionheart managed royally 
-1	we original touch monitor happy 2 years stopped working we bought replacement plan big box store ( rhymes larget ) , able get free replacement the store new boost version listed replacement i suspicious i noticed original price new boost $ 30 less original price old unit my suspicions confirm first day used new boost version it 's junky unreliable 1 the temperature reading 8-10 degrees quite extreme this flaw dangerous , not simply annoying if n't another thermometer room already , would mistakingly turned heat way 8-10 degrees huge 2 there delay turning video half screen blanks if already bug/blip , i ca n't imagine unit lasting long in fact , delay every control old version much quicker 3 the touch controls awful , press several times get work the old version sensitive 4 the 3x zoom pointless , parent wants zoom , want zoom way i ca n't imagine ever needing zoom halfway 5 it n't last nearly long dock the reason chose old version competitor ( rhymes gotorola ) bc gotorola one stay plugged whereas summer infant move around house holds charge several hours this new boost one drains much quickly 6 the product feels looks cheap even screen images controls look super cheap it feels hollow much lighter original ( not good way ) 7 panning slower , especially since screen finicky you really press controls several times get work what shame really cheapened used great product i guess 'll throw another $ 250 get competitors monitor 
-1	the problem monitor n't hold charge i go bed full charge 100 % middle night i awakened annoying beeping sound alerting battery dying i baby , i awakened every night , would want woken monitor too ? ? ? ? why not keep monitor charging unit ? because manual says consistently keep charging unit , ware battery limit battery life ! ! ! then i buy new battery i returned item 3 times case defective like i finally buy new monitor another company 's monitor last 36 hours `` sleep mode '' without charged much happier ! other , i like monitor charging issue terrible 
-1	i got pump i fourth child my insurance company let choose several options , going get medela research reading reviews rumble tuff i decided try unfortunately i not happy i find i n't get much milk i my baby young , i full wonderful milk supply , reason i get 3 ounces 10 minutes i use pump when i used medela babies definitely got more this pump advantages medela , opinion i find comfortable silicone shields and tubing not accumulate moisture like medela i like bottle stands bottles n't tip put i liked feature turns manual pump i never actually used , originally attracted pump ( i guess i thought i hate pumping , maybe i would like manual pump better ) i never used there also less shlep around pump could medela came huge backpack as another poster said , carry bag pump really joke ( zipper even ! ) easier stuff small bag not lug around giant backpack the bottom line , i home baby use pump i get occasional evening away for purpose pump okay but i working full time relied pump way i could produce enough baby it simply not empty much medela ( not mention time involved - i used work pumped medela i time quick pumping session times day this pump takes 10 minutes get 3 ounces combined sides - i would need use 20 minutes time get decent amount i never kind time kill work ) i disappointed , i i would choose medela stronger i got lot milk ( and , i pretty certain not milk supply issue i seem abundance milk , i often feel full , often milk leaks , sometimes baby comes nursing milk keeps spraying anyway she doubled birth weight less three months exclusively nursing so i fairly certain pump simply not strong others ) 
-1	i & # 34 ; purchased & # 34 ; pump pump insurance would cover completely based reviews posted amazon time , i led believe rumble tuff compatible kiinde breast milk storage system that mom would use breast pump pump store breast milk , right ? well , calling company help storage systems would compatible pump , i ordered kiinde system unfortunately , review states compatibility pump kiinde storage system must false , even adapters , way system fits rumble tuff pump very disappointed not something i want trouble shooting newborn 
-1	i would buy i knew baby i putting light wetter it leaks all the time 
-1	i wanted cut corners get much less expensive version sofie giraffe i sorely disappointed this teether fit dog , not baby it smells awful , paint job appears done paint i would compare white-out it lumpy chipping places the picture makes toy appear quite pretty , person , face looks poorly done , squeak loud ( like dog chew toy ) my suggestion spend extra money get real thing 
-1	i ordered 21 mm sent 19 mm all match order number product 
-1	i bought set i returned work i would n't worry washing medela pieces every single day first , pieces not interchangeable medela pieces i would throw bag grab set flanges , valves membranes start pumping after couple days , output decreasing dramatically , i finally realized yellow valves not size medela valves not used medela flanges the valves slightly larger set nowhere packaging came set stated not interchange medela pieces i wish i figured sooner -- production went 2/3 's ineffective pumping caused unnecessary grief anxiety trying figure going i honestly crying pumping i felt like body letting baby down my second problem set also involves valves the instructions state valves put certain position ( unlike medela pieces ) so i 'm paranoid production constantly looking make sure breast milk flowing i put valves correctly and pumping women know , constantly checking monitoring worrying much breast milk coming , helps decrease it do buying & # 34 ; extra set & # 34 ; make life easier , i frantically trying get milk supply back probably going start lo formula hopefully review help women making mistake i 
-1	we recently 6th baby i 've never luck swaddling blankets really , really wanted love - especially baby 's flailing arms woke unfortunately n't work us all every time i put arms shot right the arm pockets far large newborn would surprise baby would n't able get arms i think partially due positioning velcro , awkward the right side wraps well left side n't i think velcro tips sides would major improvement even i 'm not sure would work it almost seems like sacrificed design aesthetics ( e g lets make arms wider , velcro arm n't look like straight jacket ) the fabric stretchy , nice , makes easy get as reviewers pointed , fabric lightweight , could go either way depending climate the zipper nice - manufacturer n't n't kids though it seems like obvious feature i disappointed really ca n't recommend product i think i 've pretty much given swaddling blanket point swaddle arms instead 
-1	first , design i thought i selected not design i received when i ordered diapers , product picture showed several cute designs , & # 34 ; hello kitty & # 34 ; well one two monochromatic diapers ( black silver i think ) what i received six monochromatic diapers ( black , blue , silver , pink , purple red ) i probably returned right around christmas , post office busy , yadda yadda yadda , i hate return things plus , i really needed cloth diapers lo after using diapers two months , i 've got say , actual diapers work pretty well price they contain messes well however , inserts come less useless they leak one two hours , even i double stuff i 've resorted stuffing flats prefolds pockets , work well i leaks anymore but considering i also n't get patterns i wanted , i pretty much feel like i ripped bottom line , really want cheap pockets , n't bad , prepared use different inserts n't want leaks and course , telling designs might actually get

-1	this good camera , one flaw makes not good option us : screen way bright place bedside maybe screen defective , lowest light setting different highest light setting we settled wifi baby versatile 
-1	i like concept lot blows around much wind n't stay put i trying use son sitting & # 34 ; normally & # 34 ; stroller - i wonder would worked better i infant carrier seat ? i remember reviews saying worked ok wind , i missing sort tip , let know ! 
-1	way small breaks i not sure i fix i return 
-1	i tried carrier store , seemed good , months trying , i went back old carrier i home here problems carrier : - too much work put needs lot adjusting husband wears it - clicks loud when i want put baby bed 's sleeping , kept waking click sound - too massive large carry bag - when baby faces inwards , straps right face ( 's 7 months old ) 
-1	we got baby likes facing it way heavy hot i suggest ergo baby started make forward facing carrier 
-1	i hate stuffing seriously , save money better quality , made usa diapers and i 'm ashamed i alva diapers the one print copied bumgenius , lovelace pattern companies like not supported put business 
-1	the product solid product tight 1 year old not chew wearing doesnt like chew harder ones baby friends 
-1	i bought despite mixed reviews the negative reviews stating lid would not stay closed matched experience i also found hanging case diaper bad n't work well case big swung banged around i also tried keeping diaper bag unfortunately lid wont stay shut very disappointed i regular oxo wipes case love i would also add color green really like olive green , not vibrant attractive i requested refund amazon 
-1	i use oxo wipe container zhaba shi tzu since i use baby wipes daily clean face legs it 's little larger i 'd expected looks better bathroom full container my complaint not airtight despite attractive , tupperware container works better car i n't mind using two hands open container i know contents wet the oxo holder opened pushing single button wipes n't remain wet long edit : i called oxo container continuously popped open they immediately e-mailed return postage label within couple days replacement way the new one absolutely perfect the first one i difficult close i inserted wipes this one not the first one pop top continuously popped open , whereas one remains firmly closed button depressed i believe green one different first strap not exactly match not matter me edit : we n't using dispenser anymore wipes dry fast , even kept inside controlled temperature this case stays firmly closed requires substantial press pop lid , wipes still dry completely three days i 've resorted moistening wipes warm water home use would not consider go we 've also used three different types wipes see influence dehydration , react similarly i recommend product need something hold wipes day two 
-1	it 's cute slender , lid n't close tightly , wipes would dry quickly disappointed , i returned immediately 
-1	the thing thing needs keep wipes moist available on-the-go use : n't it n't shut seal completely wipes dry-out within day if n't cost $ 4 return , i would it 's horrible , n't buy your better buying travel packs wipes plastic lid such bummer large wipes dispenser oxo matches great 
-1	i fan oxo products one miss the case rather bulky heavy diaper bag , i could let slide worked when put wipes , dry within days , making unusable ! so i would remember put new wipes every day that 's extra step i n't need busy mom disappointed 
-1	great idea , poor execution the case n't air tight , wipes dry days oxo typically makes excellent products , i 'm surprised put inferior product 
-1	i usually love oxo products , one misses mark the biggest main issue wipe dry quickly i live new mexico , pretty dry , purpose wipe box keep wet the attachment strap clever silicone strap button , i really like sturdy design snap close top i think insert needs silicone opening , slit wipes gasket closes that way would stay moist 
-1	i would n't buy i expected much higher quality piece i recieved the hardware metallic feels cheap/weak decorative portion kinda glued together i wouldnt use child older 2 3 months would prob destroy small pieces ie : dangerous eating size pieces 
-1	my daughter born 3 wks early , small side these swaddlers still n't fit even though 6 5 lbs birth 20 & # 34 ; the product info gives much larger size range , guess n't account torso length the arms fit fine i could n't velcro bottom strap without tipping hips quite bit wish could return i tossed packaging 
-1	my baby long 25 5 inches 3 months his toes touch bottom he longer fit swaddleme i bought hopes continuing swaddle this wrapsack not organic fabric option , rough less stretchy the top buttons close ( shoulder straps ) since snap button weak ! ! my baby bust swaddleme this wrapsack n't chance returned 
-1	top part thin hard plastic husband i afraid 'll hurt baby 's gum , baby reaches 4 months put anything mouth wo n't know put right way help put obviously wo n't stay put take love examine texture it therefore put back mouth sometimes does't always end right way hard plastic 're afraid , might hurt baby 's growing teeth gums n't really like it glow dark pretty alright 
-1	i read reviews i purchased i neglected i liked pattern & appreciation kushies brand i searching mat go high chairs moved high chairs without scratching floors this type mat not serve purpose i returning 
-1	this incredibly cute n't go way ends crib rail , leaves 2-3 inches either side , meaning son easily still gnaw end i also liked 's wide velcro , since crib rails wider normal , tie one 's n't work i worried velcro not strong enough little man 'll eventually pull all , i probably would not buy 
-1	my 2 5 year old toddler peepee accident car the toddler soaked , pad soaked , carseat soaked foam this another piece wash totally useless its going back 
-1	this review : philips avent digital video baby monitor night vision ( baby product ) customer review amazon vine program ( what 's ? ) i used foscam baby monitor i think 's lot better ( happens much cheaper ) : foscam fi8910w pan & tilt ip/network camera two-way audio night vision ( black ) i like foscam much because:1 ) better security - 's essential2 ) i pan tilt , another essential using video baby monitors this philips avent unit must laser-like targeted consistently keep baby viewable 3 ) works iphone - unlike philips avent unit 4 ) doubles security cam - unlike philips avent unit , also security cam must work iphone also andriod , blackberry pc this philips avent n't compare well 's darn limited 
-1	sorry negative review goes the philips avent digital video baby monitor night vision basic you get night vision camera , night light camera , lullabies sound activated screen the resolution not high res like philips says , best standard res the battery life said seven hours i managed four the range said 30 meters walls half the adjustments make volume screen brightness we v-tech baby monitor half price much better resolution , twice screen size , ability remote talk , ability add multiple camera , vibration alert option , temperature reading much better range plus nigh vision sound activated screen lullaby features the phillips advantage camera size though even battery back-up camera compact also sound activated screen works better v-tech not adjust sensitivity anyway if camera $ 100 less would ok buy , even several cameras near price point features if less $ 80 i could recommend 's not i ca n't 
-1	my daughter always hated chair when little head support high older n't seem support kind pushes forward looking getting fisher price bounce chair save money buy something better wish i 
-1	after starting potty training i realized small foot stool front toilet not enough space toddler climb turn around after research i decided purchase item despite hefty price tag i thought wrap around spacing would give room but arrived tried , i realized width step pretty much regular foot stool he still hold onto slowly turn around i always go potty i thought extra room might mean start go little independently but n't look secure tiny little steps turn around i tell n't feel secure either maybe provides enough space stability older kid ( 3-4 yo ) younger toddler ( son little 2 yo ) might well use regular foot stool rubber base stands securely ( one not rubber base like baby bjorn foot stool ) it also really annoying adults use potty around 
-1	would rated higher if:1 they pre-folded smaller i fold get smushed bag , 're already creased packaging tend retain original shape better 2 the two teenie adhesive stickers awful ! might well make one big strip i could n't even find , 're two small stickers n't serve much point i wanted replace & # 34 ; pottycover - disposable toilet seat covers ( 6 individually packaged seat covers bag ) & # 34 ; longer available ( those fabulous ) so 'll job , 're still crummy 
-1	i n't used yet , i wash everything seems work great none bags broke i opening zippers yes , opening seems little small , big deal , i use funnel fill great price ( $ 10 00 6 ) i 'm not complaining ***so i 've 3 mo noticed things i n't like i 've 2 6 zippers break , i hand wash i 'm very careful i open the zippers n't last ( even though i 've 3 mo , i 've used handful times ) also , i fill yogurt i use , really tough clean crevices , like really tough i 've tried bottle brushes , sponges , finally used butter knife get bottom i 'm typically someone loves save money , i 'd probably buy expensive ones next time get use

-1	for part , monitor fine it 's small unobtrusive , 's cute functional however critical flaw prevent ever actually using : soon i plugged transmitter ( part goes baby 's room ) i could hear loud , high pitched sound i know sound **my** room **i** trying sleep , would drive absolutely nuts there 's way i 'm going baby 's room -- i n't want bother n't sleep soundly , neither i disclaimer : ears hear high sounds much better everyone i know there 's good chance plug monitor not hear thing i suspect manufacturer idea even it also possible mine defect others n't however , important note almost across board , young children hear higher sounds adults ( age , high pitched sounds first go ) this means n't hear anything n't mean baby wo n't just something think

-1	i skip hop products generally i love , creativity construction , set nesting blocks needs rethought the corners cube blocks sharp pointy , child unstable fall , could serious tears hands i like blocks animals three sides match , designs colors cute i n't think 's safe toy , hold attention little one long for reason 's relegated decorative purposes , price i n't think 's worth

-1	overall , high chair quite functional intuitive , feels like prioritized wrong features invest in the recline not add value , opinion ( granted i bought kiddo stopped taking bottle ) adds footprint take space kitchen the quick-adjust height seems like overkill - really adjust height major milestones , i 'd rather chair harder adjust every 3 months ugly molded plastic extra levers i look every day pros : - easy assemble- simple , intuitive mechanisms adjusting height , recline chair , tray- affordable compared aesthetically attractive optionscons : - tray not easily washable - i 'm worried water sitting inside locking mechanism getting moldy- aesthetic looks like hospital walker elevated toilet seat- huge footprint 21 & # 34 ; wide x 32 & # 34 ; deep ( compared stokke trip trapp 18 & # 34 ; wide 19 & # 34 ; deep )

-1	i 'm sure lot women master love i 'm clearly not smart enough really find easy enough use i actually use i bought 's pretty much sitting drawer since it comfy i get short time guy tolerate , seems like much effort i prefer baby bjorn 's easier get on i think 's probably much better winter babies earth going wear thing summer time ? it 's lot material 
-1	not figure use my baby not comfortable the price expensive returned end 
-1	fiddly , way overpriced piece material try wrapping long piece cloth around , getting impatient baby tie really tight give sufficient support head , result tight around little legs or - like lady photo - keep holding head , sort defeats purpose it also make way warm maybe ok european winters , not otherwise i getting rid mine ( i see lots people likewise ) using rucksack-style carrier - much less hassle

-1	what happened to orbit baby ? i owned orbit baby g2 travel system enjoyed 's thoughtful design , smooth operation , fancy fabric materials used the price commanded fully warrants it now 's third revision , technically first product release since acquired ergobaby - company i also patronize organic baby carriers what changed ? for one , fabric it 's thicker rougher the tactile feel makes not elegant touch the previous g2 sleek smooth second , retractable plastic mechanism operation n't smooth it 's obviously simple plastic teeth spring underneath operation pull harder extend sunshade this nitpicking , course , price i expect smoothest operation possible even make use ball bearings magnets again , price third , although i 've accepted fact colors websites not accurate person blueberry sunshade arrived lighter hue dark blueberry/purplish expectation fourth important washability it used i unhook whole sunshade fabric away 's plastic support easy washing via zippers now sunshade sewn plastic support wash ( manual g3 n't state wash versus manual g2 model readily discloses ) wash whole fabric 's support system hope nothing rusts time okay , disassemble plastic support , 'll need force tabs screwdriver hope plastic n't break wear time again , manual n't disclose i n't know much support provide going route wish made easy remove like g2 model so what are the features debbie downer ? okay , latest sunshade rated upf50+ the fabric , like orbit baby fabrics , certified oeko-tex standard healthy clean baby another plus customize stroller sunshade get go without orbit baby force basic color when purchase g3 stroller seat , n't come sunshade the price less g2 stroller seat exactly amount cost sunshade so make sure buy sunshade go along orbit baby g3 stroller purchase you n't stick black i black , blueberry teal colors at rate stroll around downtown city , 's easier wash sunshade switch colors dry up overalli wish ergobaby purchase orbit baby would go back roots orbit baby became known yes , stuck killer design make modern parents especially dads proud push stroller around but also made construction basic retained high price seems unbelievable previous orbit baby owners like see changes making look feel cheap i would expected g3 version , made peek-a-boo window still see baby he/she forward facing my umbrella stroller feature a full size stroller well no-brainer option especially price for first time orbit baby owners , course would n't know difference changed change ownership affected third revision by way fabric fits g2 strollers , close pricing g2 accessories better material g2 i would not recommend getting g3 sunshade g2 stroller all hoping g4 revision bring orbit baby back 's roots

-1	mommy 's helper car seat price went day went queue it still seemed like good idea , one arrived full price i contact fix problem 
-1	i wanted upgrade old baby monitor optimistic d-link 's use & # 34 ; cloud & # 34 ; would provide truly mobile system unfortunately , attempting use d-link wifi day/night baby camera remote proven painfully frustrating experience the build quality seems good , cute friendly design unfortunately , none attractive features make difference camera tendency shut off/reset within first minutes use the d-link wifi baby camera 's greatest downfall software the app needed operate device slow definitely not user-friendly even multi-hour setup process ( including number false-starts resets ) , many features n't work well & # 34 ; cloud & # 34 ; this includes talking baby , activating lullabies , etc the feed also tends lag dramatically at times i able get camera briefly working , range 15-20 feet ( common standard , much cheaper baby monitors ) it upsetting think wasted time spent trying get app work right i regret set-up d-link account ( mandatory ) gives outside entity access phone well camera currently still connected router i hope iphone/ipad users not experiencing similar difficulties as android user , i not recommend item current state others intending use android version software 
-1	this combo potential the colors fantastic eye catching my daughter drawn see eyes light i put mat unfortunately toy bar falls defeats purpose part entertainment this became frustrating not daughter well the included pillow really not useful support seat helps little tummy time since slick the included toys liked daughter developmentally appropriate however , actual seat positioner upright daughter slides quickly it seems baby able sit seat short window usefulness gets tossed aside 
-1	this thing adorable , i wish 'd dollars frame the frame hollow bent tubing , say support baby 25 lbs , i feel like 'll wind thing bending slowly towards ground 're baby heavier softball between vibration low weight allowance start , i worry could rattle apart , especially baby big squirmer that said , super cute i love butterfly wings double wrap despite picture clearly least 6 month old , intended newborns , height allowance wo n't get much past the toys velcor rather hooks , baby could pull one enough effort , i actually like the overall design colorful , take 5 minutes put together the battery case annoying , screwed shut , totally unnecessary requires additional tools overall , really cute option , better designed others i 've seen , $ 45 , insufficient deliver 
-1	well , start the front wheel not smooth turning old 2012 version once baby sleeping inside , i not change incline smoothly infact i play around pushing upwards downwards i highly suggest everyone buy old version another point recall new version , i feel britax not done perfect job 
-1	i giving monitor 2 star rating i actually n't used yet , bought months ago amazon first delayed purchase hard board set ( one requirements ) , charged plugged realized test get sensitivity level right would risk letting beep wake daughter nap i n't know parents , really n't day i want risk nap would love know parents felt like gave peace mind , not also curious , beeping ever wake baby ? 
-1	this drying rack gigantic , really big kitchen it looks unfriendly sitting counter size pointy shape i thought would perfect us , i could n't get big i add use bottles sometimes typically use smaller ones i would imagine 're heavily using 8 16 oz bottles could work , us really big worth i 've also seen drying racks much easier eye ours ended baby toy back box 
-1	it served 's purpose , broke day use the wood cheap i wooden ones different companies , better it works , 's delicate i would n't 
-1	i think bags large not self standing i would n't buy brand 
-1	lansinoh baby bottle naturawave nipple the nipples bottle interchangeable ( like bottle companies ) use slow , medium fast nipple baby grows it uses air ventilation system ( avs ) reduces intake air- potential cause colic spit it bpa free nipple made 100 % silicone most bottles tried past similar this bottle fewer parts - making easy assemble clean state but i prefer ones parts venting system i find baby liked alot better the one thing i really dislike cap / lid most baby bottles leak , cap comes , nipple hits something drip its fact but cap this/lid easily twists , not right , tight gets bumped , undo i highly dislike it 's nice things open easy i think way easy = lots spills would recommend bottles recommend test store see open close etc 
-1	the nipple weird my daughter would n't use also i n't think plastic high grade i like avent ones feel bit heavier far thickness sturdiness bottle we 're not fans love company not bottle 
-1	only 3 suction cups would ever stay time it also bit big car windows , would sag not block much sun we wound returning looking replacement 
-1	i actually acquired two firmly decided stink ! i purchased first one , target worked great two weeks 1 four suction cups started continuously falling six months later one suction cup actually stay stuck window i recently opportunity receive free one amazon thought , & # 34 ; hell , i loved thing first two weeks & # 34 ; i thought maybe first one defective soon discovered first day second one , not case one suction cups failed i would never give product another chance in opinion falls category , good true = ( 
-1	ugh another window shade n't deliver we cleaned window prior installation , n't help stick when sun shines window , warms , suction cups come right defeats purpose sun shade i 'd advise skipping one too much frustration little sun protection 
-1	these hang window , great us on hand only upside they not compensate nearly enough slant top window actually misaligned bottom traditional ones the worst part though rattle ! i put something keep quiet otherwise drives nuts driving 
-1	we used britax sunshades keep two middle windows , 've lost clinginess past year my wife drives daughter daycare mornings , route sun shining directly onto faces , needed replacements immediately i installed one left window test the clips top somewhat thin , i thought 'd break eventually however , i like shade covered window previous britax ones did when i closed door successfully installing shade , though , i heard plastic clatter window i thought window first , i immediately removed shade reapplied sure enough , made noise i found plastic bar hitting window i closed , thought would n't big issue when i came home work , i noticed shade floor car i asked wife later n't like -- '' no '' apparently clatter window keeps occurring whenever driving , noise became annoying my wife guest car day , commented annoying noise was so , unfortunately , shade cover bit , 're going rely tinting already installed windows adequate sun block rather suffer clanging noise 
-1	you attach shade window either tabs ( open window , hook plastic tabs onto top window , close window ) suction cups pull shade push plastic button right side housing roll shade back up pros:1 it block lot sun 2 easy install use3 you still see window on cons:1 bulky cheap feeling - plastic everything i 'd afraid kind missile becomes accident 2 when push release button , help roll otherwise , tendency get askew rolls up 3 breaks i like drive window found wind comes car , tugs shade made hyperextend now not retract all if i really needed shade car , i would rather use ultra-light pop open sun shade things they super light would n't danger case accident , 's nothing really fail , work better over-engineered piece junk not recommended 
-1	granted , part problem might i 'm driving mazda 3 , really deep captain seat style chairs scaling part issue , i expected mirror little bigger hand positioning another major headache the clip attaching seat two problems the jaws n't big enough get seat shoulder , theres rubberized grip either jaw , meaning super-slick chair surface shoots like slingshot first speed bump that 's want hear 1-2 lb saucer plate catapult air right baby this currently 2 stars glaring oversight , i 'm back sentra , use suction cup attach rear window , maybe creep 3-4 range but seriously brica , 're asking lawsuit falls headrest bonks baby face either texture jaws clip , put rubber sleeve jaws actually clip headrest this applicable 're stuck use mirror captains chair seat ( i ) , still not insignificant number customers 
-1	i not recommend mirror mirror not stick well window i stuck window 5 minutes fell window luckily i n't child carseat mirror fell car seat 
-1	this mirror not safe i would not recommend i could n't get stick long i gave i n't want fall hit son upon research i learned mirrors not recommended anyway as become projectiles car accident so i wo n't purchasing sort replacement either 
-1	using clip , i attached visor since car seat facing forward for , mirror jiggled much , even though roads rather smooth even trying reposition , never could find spot satisfactory it useful seeing child , awhile , i started feeling bit motion sick jiggling my husband tried briefly , n't like reason did not try suction cups since not using rear facing car seat 
-1	pros : it & # 8217 ; cool looking , comes apart easily cleaning , slip-resistant ( baby stays put n't slide around ) looks like designed drowning prevention mind it eliminates deep pool water baby might slip back turned seconds non-slid feet spigot plus works well rinsing running water tube cons : this tub cold winter while using tub niece shivered entire time the bottom tube holds bit water & # 34 ; radiant & # 34 ; heat water , along silicone mat , suppose keep warm , epic fail if baby 8 pounds , not able use tub your child grow tub pretty fast 
-1	the concept amazing ! i excited give try try i , however , not expected the tray 4 pieces snap together flimsy best the snap together sections leave openings pinched daughter 's arm also , foam insert felt cheap maybe i 'm spoiled thickness bumbo foam part falls thin i returned 
-1	i hoping love bag , missing key features i realize i need here pros cons opinion : pros : - nice color ( peacock ) , nice looking bag- roomy - holds plenty , probably even enough 1 kid- side pockets side useful - use one side bottle sippy , one side owncons : - price , bag actual & # 34 ; features & # 34 ; 's awfully expensive large tote bag - & # 34 ; feet & # 34 ; bottom , set bag bathroom sticky restaurant floor , bag likely get dirty - hook/fob keys , would really help saving time/frustration digging keys every time - real organization inside bag it 's nice bag comes two pouches , part bag big empty space n't built-in organization yes side pockets main compartment , slim , ca n't see 's without reaching inside the included pouches distract fact bag n't help organize put it - one way carry bag -- one shoulder i tried bag carrying child ergo carrier , shoulder neck aching i wish bag backpack option least longer strap could go crossbody/messenger style like i said , i high hopes bag , i disappointed & # 34 ; features & # 34 ; if need roomy bag , nice one , peacock color vivid 
-1	i 'm extremely disappointed bottle it leaks pretty much pours bottom , absolutely useless for $ 15 50 ? ! this not leak , all i 'm disappointed high hopes shattered first attempt use bottle 
-1	i really wanted like bottle customer service great emailed twice use bottle i put extra star matter many time i follow instruction bottle leaked i love idea want bottle used leak leaking breastmilk book , bottom piece i idea 's even falls i think maybe need liner like plastic circle things blenders bottom wo n't leak , something my problem leaks a lot 
-1	it leaked , baby n't know , several failed attempts assebly not self explanatory pieces look : ( do n't recommend 
-1	i wanted like product much , i ended returning first , i received i washed first use washed cold tumble dried low , still came shrunken not much muslin fabric trim around entire thing secondly , careful velcro touches muslin rips shreds thirdly , velcro two long pieces across chest , n't even think readjusting need baby sleeping loud i returned cotton ones without swaddle wrap we 'll see goes ! 
-1	i realize i minority , i really not like pillow i know supposed sit right chest breastfeeding , i found still way tight wear comfortably ( for reference , i weighed 135 pregnancy gained 35 pounds i 'm two weeks postpartum , i still n't consider exceptionally large point ) i like option turn pillow upside use sit baby , though n't used much side yet and optional vibration also interesting feature , though , , baby n't interested yet overall , especially price , i 'm not terribly impressed pillow if i ca n't comfortably use breastfeeding , 's point ? i 'd rather use myboppy pillow slipcover , peaceful jungleormy brest friend original pillow , fireworkspillows at least fit around 
-1	the spoon wonderful , 's i would buy spoon separately , i certainly would n't buy products the wipe container lets much air keep wipes moist , travel cover snack cup n't good job keeping cereal inside , 've trouble flow liquid sippy cup , options okay but spoon oh spoon ! you ca n't really tell pictures , spoon angled slightly , thus making easy feed baby even 's looking things tray the angle also helps keep food spoon feeding 
-1	the large size wearable blankets nice idea theory , poor practice at age size appropriate ( 18-24 pounds ) , children moving ( even crib ) , extra floppiness gets way , enclosed feet tended frustrate daughter to make worse , opening one sleeve garment half size , arm n't fit properly without alterations ( i n't need seam ripper sewing machine get product expensive function ) i understand company 's products newborns younger infants swaddling makes sense kids young but children approach year , product really n't necessary helpful or even made well , case one i received 
-1	my daughter tiny age still use sleep sacks wearable blankets every night putting garment much part routine prayers , story time little bit milk i excited receive product disappointed i used the sleeves non functioning it felt like i putting child strait jacket the arm holes not well thought overall disappointed 
-1	i swaddleme products , much satisfactory in general , concept 're swaddles dummies i e , n't need figure ridiculous trick allows swaddling banal , square blanket instead , use velcro turn formless sack baby-straightjacket mode for without screaming infant , 's major plus a priori , i kind imagined would lie gently submit swaddled ( especially since 're supposed like ) but n't they squirm writhe freak as , velcro winner ( although generally nuisance times & # 8230 ; ) so , swaddleme products big win this one not much let start obvious failure the zipper runs not parallel length sleep sack ( way makes sense , lay baby inside ) , rather transverse ( means pull baby 's head , & # 8230 ; instant unhappiness ) ostensibly , makes easier change diapers but , often case , distance theory practice rather vast in reality , makes much much harder get lt sleep sack , results fussing , crying , wailing and baby n't happy either as side note , also n't really make easier change child alone , would make suboptimal undesirable as say , however , & # 34 ; but wait ! there 's ! & # 34 ; to wit , despite fact swaddleme sleep sack small , one also small , one fits really poorly lt & # 8230 ; 10th percentile something like weight , 75th percentile length so & # 8230 ; not huge baby but 's not length problem it 's girth when i try velcro swaddle , 's little too straightjackety it 's bit ridiculous imagine many babies going fit well thing i understand swaddles tight bit extreme , reminding tasteless jokes childhood i truly hoping would excellent product , like winter swaddleme i pretty disappointed i said small size swaddle , i really hoping larger one would better but really n't there middle ground ; baby falls squarely sizes , large swaddleme big , n't effectively swaddle in nod sanity retain sense composure , i i always two star products i tossed aside , went got something else in case , i got halo 100 % cotton sleepsack swaddle , amazon product : b003e6obma , i would give four stars all complaints small exist well just go get something better 
-1	i really liked soft slightly velvety side cover thecomfort & harmony mombo deluxe covered nursing pillow , enchanting elephants i expecting slipcover similar it 's not it slippery synthetic feel it n't feel nearly comfortable baby i 'm likely without nursing pillow washing original cover rather using one 
-1	this baby tub folds half , not take much space snap open , easy do then unfold legs down easy then blow plastic liner underneath there two plastic holes blow side it like blowing beach ball , easy , much harder not harder blow , i could not , blow , putthe rubber stoppers close fast air could blow , leak fast this also plastic smell , i think awhile dissipate , i hope ! i could not life get air thing maybe i something wrong ! the plastic liner thin , i think could leak while before putting baby on plastic liner , put baby towel soft baby lay to so far i given 1 star but looks cute colors nice ! i not given hubby chance blow yet if figure success , i 'll back new review 
-1	pros : - excellent picture quality- great color night vision- both units operate battery , power saving options built in cons : - super janky design camera unit white , monitor unit pale , hospital yellow yuck - camera unit 2-3 inch & # 34 ; tale & # 34 ; sticking ( i think microphone ) , shown 1 many marketing photos - battery covers very hard remove - monitor settings very confusing not well explained , even detailed operating manual ( not included box , i go website get pdf ) 
-1	i & # 8217 ; know got defective cups , not work you not drink nothing comes spout , no matter much sucking , impossible i tried , wife tried & # 8230 ; kids tried results my son got mad i took thing apart put back together times , making sure exactly shown diagram , still nothing so , either everyone else reviewing blind reviewing , ones i received mail defective 
-1	i 'm sad say i not impressed performance cup i using two cups pretty exclusively week leak if stay upright never get thrown great , however , little hands tend drop even throw objects , happens bets i wiping milk water floor , hands , table i pretty close retiring guys ( using exclusively water ) honestly , shame super cute cups , good design far drinking goes , insulated 
-1	these bottles nice addition collection , i noticed poorly constructed the `` anti-colic '' valve base may help relieve symptom ( i never noticed since i jackpot baby 's never colicy ) , base leaks out 4 bottles , least 2 dribble placed flat surface third suspect while could understandable months use , 're new still cling wrap them the odd shape may help holding also makes bottles little difficult clean , making feel like remove valve base well head get every part internal curves overall , not worth i got set backup bottles , 're almost going trash weeks use seeing i got two negative votes day i wrote , please provide feedback not find review helpful , i feel like fairly written illustrate i felt serious design flaw 
-1	when using cheapo unvented bottles , daughter never seems realize could get milk faster 'd break suction regularly reduce vacuum inside bottle perhaps never engineer , i hoped anyway , i think venting valves latch bottles great principle but valve seems require fair bit vacuum opens let air combined unusually broad shape nipple , frequently causes nipple get sucked inverted position in mind nipple blame valve you n't want valve leaking liquid , needs pre-tension holding shut the resulting vacuum not enough significantly interfere milk flow , acceptable at least valve serves real function the nipple shape , hand , could easily changed conical form would resist collapse , little loss comfort basically i feel nipple marketing thing appear different brands something actually improved significant way and `` pumping '' obviously marketing hype bs , nipple inversion clearly indicating presence vacuum -- rather pressure -- inside bottle i 'm little astonished others saying babies prefer bottle ; baby drink milk bottle give assuming nipple not inside-out i previously cut slack given bottle 3 star rating , talking wife says really dislikes bottle wo n't using anymore due nipple collapsing issue for reason , combined totally unreasonable cost , i reduce rating 1 star 
-1	im man i hardly tighten straps my wife not pull strap tighten straps the plastic clip across chest not snap well 3 months old 
-1	if product , motor will fail not matter lasted 4 months died night wife i completely exhausted left us even lower back pain this not product leave kid us , great rocking sleep could easily transfer crib time time 
-1	i really liked monitor first , second night use i decided unplug bring receiver nightstand the night i left plugged across room dresser with old angelcare , battery always lasted night ( 8 hours less ) vtech monitor i woke wth ? turned back saw low battery nice good thing child sound-sleeping toddler rarely wakes , not infant need several feedings night i go back angelcare we tried next day nap time , battery started die ( full charge ) 3 hours original review : we using angelcare basic sound monitor , nothing special , getting the angelcare 's audio still working 2 years , display longer functioning we switched nights ago i like better *the sound quality good we use noise machine son 's room angelcare always sounded echo-ey with vtech , noise machine sounds like 's sitting dresser i clearly hear son makes noise room *the video display good price point , still mediocre the angle not wide enough takes careful positioning i nothing compare , i would imagine spent 'd get better video you definitely tell 're looking , reminds bit looking ultrasound picture room dark you make head see moving i n't know i expected in case , not feature i require , video nice i 'm not sure useful would infant my son 2 it nice see 's standing makes sound , maybe 's dreaming *very easy hook i made adjustments turned it dead box needed charge , not lost reception anywhere 1900 sq , foot house our angelcare cradle charger , i miss , simple a/c plug works fine , *talk back feature nice have n't used yet , i like option especially son jumps big boy bed again , not sure would useful infant i sitting dresser , i not tried wall ceiling mount , i would imagine 'd get better visuals as , i see son crib bars , 's not best line sight overall , i think great inexpensive video monitor , i think 's adequate people 's needs 
-1	apparently get pay i 've used philips audio monitors last three kids , pain move place solution want visit friend relatives drop cheap audio monitor bag go well would really great units would connect consistently the whole point technology use walls normal buildings if line sight device radio able maintain connection reliably , well unit unnecessary then i 'll deal taking expensive quality units - getting cheap one certainly n't give confidence static loss connection experienced 
-1	the old saying holds true product -- `` get pay '' while , i like , led lights signal noise baby 's room , i not comfortable using digital monitor small infant night battery life n't great product it n't live `` static-free '' claim either and , volume control function seems work okay , product overall makes bit nervous best use might intercom older child i 'd recommend paying bit getting one higher review ratings - overall disappointing product 
-1	we great deal research purchasing item , loved small size seemingly unique features the main issue `` swing '' slow ! babies like small , fast movements , even highest setting , swing slow it seems like baby would like gentle smooth movements , baby n't love also different `` settings '' seem similar it not vibrate either , , price , i thought would 've nice feature we n't another swing compare , used anyway , ended mainly rocking glider 5 s 's harvey karp suggests ( 's genius , way ) i would get traditional swing next time if item would lower price $ 100 may worth getting trying , definitely not current selling price i like plugs small , 's keep looking 
-1	i ordered great success two packages liners discovering much i really like bestbottom line ! only problem pack pilling shedding like crazy gets everything ! i really appreciate ease use covers liners they trim fit good absorbancy must bad batch i plan return re-order hope better liner
